"Global Findex is an individual level survey, measuring individual’s "
"ownership of accounts. As financial inclusion is an individual-level "
"concept, this is the appropriate measure. Other surveys that are done at "
"household level may measure the access to finance through another member of "
"the household which may overestimate financial inclusion."

"## Concepts\n"
"\n"
"Account at a financial institution includes respondents who report having "
"an account at a bank or at another type of financial institution, such as a "
"credit union, microfinance institution, cooperative, or the post office (if "
"applicable), or having a debit card in their own name. In addition, it "
"includes respondents who report receiving wages, government transfers, or "
"payments for agricultural products into an account at a financial "
"institution in the past 12 months; paying utility bills or school fees from "
"an account at a financial institution in the past 12 months; or receiving "
"wages or government transfers into a card in the past 12 months. Mobile "
"money account includes respondents who report personally using GSM "
"Association (GSMA) Mobile Money for the Unbanked (MMU) services in the past "
"12 months to pay bills or to send or receive money. In addition, it "
"includes respondents who report receiving wages, government transfers, or "
"payments for agricultural products through a mobile phone in the past 12 "
"months."

"## Rationale\n"
"\n"
"Access to formal financial services such as savings, insurance, payments, "
"credit and remittances is essential to the ability of people—regardless of "
"income level, gender, age, education or where they live—to manage their "
"lives, build their futures, and grow their businesses. Having access to an "
"account is an important starting point for people to access a range of "
"financial services."
