Definition and concepts</p><p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
<p>The percentage of schools by level of education ( (primary, lower secondary and upper secondary education) primary education) with access to the given facility or service.</p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p>Electricity: Regularly and readily available sources of power (e.g. grid/mains connection, wind, water, solar and fuel-powered generator, etc.) that enable the adequate and sustainable use of ICT infrastructure for educational purposes.</p>
<p>Internet for pedagogical purposes: Internet that is available for enhancing teaching and learning and is accessible by pupils. Internet is defined as a worldwide interconnected computer network, which provides pupils access to a number of communication services including the World Wide Web and carries e-mail, news, entertainment and data files, irrespective of the device used (i.e. not assumed to be only via a computer) and thus can also be accessed by mobile telephone, tablet, PDA, games machine, digital TV etc.). Access can be via a fixed narrowband, fixed broadband, or via mobile network.</p>
<p>Computers for pedagogical use: Use of computers to support course delivery or independent teaching and learning needs. This may include activities using computers or the Internet to meet information needs for research purposes; develop presentations; perform hands-on exercises and experiments; share information; and participate in online discussion forums for educational purposes. A computer is a programmable electronic device that can store, retrieve and process data, as well as share information in a highly-structured manner. It performs high-speed mathematical or logical operations according to a set of instructions or algorithms. Computers include the following types:</p>
<p>- A desktop computer usually remains fixed in one place; normally the user is placed in front of it, behind the keyboard;</p>
<p>- A laptop computer is small enough to carry and usually enables the same tasks as a desktop computer; it includes notebooks and netbooks but does not include tablets and similar handheld devices; and</p>
<p>- A tablet (or similar handheld computer) is a computer that is integrated into a flat touch screen, operated by touching the screen rather than using a physical keyboard.</p>
<p>Adapted infrastructure is defined as any built environment related to education facilities that are accessible to all users, including those with different types of disability, to be able to gain access to use and exit from them. Accessibility includes ease of independent approach, entry, evacuation and/or use of a building and its services and facilities (such as water and sanitation), by all of the building&apos;s potential users with an assurance of individual health, safety and welfare during the course of those activities. </p>
<p>Adapted materials include learning materials and assistive products that enable students and teachers with disabilities/functioning limitations to access learning and to participate fully in the school environment. </p>
<p>Accessible learning materials include textbooks, instructional materials, assessments and other materials that are available and provided in appropriate formats such as audio, braille, sign language and simplified formats that can be used by students and teachers with disabilities/functioning limitations. </p>
<p>Basic drinking water is defined as a functional drinking water source (MDG &#x2018;improved&#x2019; categories) on or near the premises and water points accessible to all users during school hours. </p>
<p>Basic sanitation facilities are defined as functional sanitation facilities (MDG &#x2018;improved&#x2019; categories) separated for males and females on or near the premises. </p>
<p>Basic handwashing facilities are defined as functional handwashing facilities, with soap and water available to all girls and boys.</p></div><a name="UNIT_MEASURE"></a><div id="UNIT_MEASURE"><p class="concept-name">2.b.

<p>(2) Cross-national learning assessments</p></div><a name="COLL_METHOD"></a><div id="COLL_METHOD"><p class="concept-name">3.b. Data collection method</p><p><strong>For administrative sources:</strong></p>
<p>The UNESCO Institute for Statistics produces time series based on data reported by Ministries of Education or National Statistical Offices. The data are gathered through the annual Survey of Formal Education (on access to electricity, drinking water, sanitation and handwashing facilities) and through the Survey on ICTs in Education (on access to electricity, Internet and computers). Data on adapted infrastructure are not collected currently. Countries are asked to report data according to the levels of education defined in the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) to ensure international comparability of resulting indicators.</p>
<p>The data received are validated using electronic error detection systems that check for arithmetic errors and inconsistencies and trend analysis for implausible results. Queries are taken up with the country representatives reporting the data so that corrections can be made (of errors) or explanations given (of implausible but correct results). During this process, countries are also encouraged to provide estimates for missing or incomplete data items.</p>
<p>In addition, countries also have an opportunity to see and comment on the main indicators the UIS produces in an annual &#x201C;country review&#x201D; of indicators.</p>
<p><strong>For cross-national learning assessments:</strong></p>
<p>Data is acquired from the administrators of cross-national assessment; typically, these are available for download publicly. UIS analyses this data to provide estimates of the indicator. When there is more than one data point available for a given level of schooling, an average is used as the indicator. Annexe Table 2 presents the questionnaire used to collect data in the cross-national assessments included. </p></div><a name="FREQ_COLL"></a><div id="FREQ_COLL"><p class="concept-name">3.c.

Treatment of missing values (i) at country level and (ii) at regional level</p><p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>
<p>The UIS estimates certain key items of data that may be missing or incomplete in order to have publishable estimates at the country level. Where this is not possible, the UIS imputes missing values for use only for calculating regional and global aggregates. </p>
<p>In all cases, estimates are based on evidence from the country itself (e.g., information from the data provider on the size of the missing component, via correspondence, publications or data on the Ministry&#x2019;s or National Statistical Office&#x2019;s Webpage, or via surveys conducted by other organizations) or on data from the country for a previous year.</p>
<p>Where data are available for a country for both an earlier and a more recent year than the missing year, a simple linear interpolation is made. Where data are only available for an earlier year, the most recent value is used as an estimate. Similarly, where data are only available for a more recent year, the last value is used as an estimate.</p>
<p>Where the relevant data are not available at all for a country, estimates may be based on another variable which is clearly linked to the item being estimated. For example, schools with access to basic services or facilities may be estimated from the total number of schools.</p>
<p>Where no data are available for the country in any year that can inform the estimate, the unweighted average for the region in which the country lies is used.</p>
<p>Currently no estimates are made for this indicator for the purpose of having publishable country-level data.</p>
<p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>
<p>Regional and global aggregates are derived from both publishable and imputed national data. Publishable data are the data submitted to the UIS by Member States or the result of an explicit estimation made by the Institute based on pre-determined standards. In both cases, these data are sent to Member States for review before they are considered publishable by the UIS. </p>
<p>When data are not available for all countries, the UIS imputes national data for the sole purpose of calculating regional averages. These imputed data are not published nor otherwise disseminated. </p>
<p>The regional and global aggregates are then calculated as weighted averages using the denominator of the indicator as the weight.</p></div><a name="REG_AGG"></a><div id="REG_AGG"><p class="concept-name">4.g. Regional aggregations</p><p>Regional and global aggregates are calculated as weighted averages using the denominator of the indicator as the weight.

<p><strong>Annexe: methods used to estimate indicator values using cross-national assessments</strong></p>
<p>Cross national assessments are sample-based and, as such, provide estimates of the proportion of schools with the given facility. Estimation methods followed those suggested by the respective organization providing the cross-national assessment data. All surveys utilized a two-stage sampling procedure, randomly selecting schools and within those classes or students. School-level (first stage) data was used to estimate the percentages of schools with the given facilities. Data was weighted by school sampling weights. The population which the sample of schools represented are presented in Annexe Table 1.</p>
