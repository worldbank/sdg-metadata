<p><u>Sustainability Reports</u>: </p>
<p>For the purposes of this indicator, &#x2018;sustainability reports&#x2019; will not be limited to stand-alone sustainability reports produced by companies, but will be considered as &#x2018;reporting sustainability information&#x2019; and expanded to other forms of reporting sustainability information, such as publishing sustainability information as part of the company&#x2019;s annual reports or reporting sustainability information to the national government. This is to ensure that the focus of the indicator is on tracking the publishing of sustainability information, rather than on the practice of publishing stand-alone sustainability reports. It also ensures that the indicator interpretation is aligned with the wording of Target 12.6 which refers to promoting &#x201C;the integration of sustainability information into the annual reporting cycle of companies&#x201D;. </p>
<p><u>Company:</u></p>
<p>While many companies report at the group level, many of their impacts will be local, and some subsidiaries or franchises produce separate sustainability reports. As a practice that should be encouraged, and one that is useful to monitor, it is therefore proposed to count both the group and subsidiary/franchise level separately, as separate entities. &#x201C;Company&#x201D; can therefore apply to either the parent company, or a franchise or subsidiary, depending on their reporting practices.</p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p>It is proposed that, to be counted towards the indicator, companies are encouraged to publish information that meets a &#x201C;Minimum requirement&#x201D; of disclosure. A core set of economic, environmental, social and governance disclosures of sustainability information is therefore identified. In defining these disclosure elements, the custodian agencies attempted to align with the disclosures that appear in existing related reporting frameworks, including the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) reporting framework, the Global Reporting Initiative Standard (GRI), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) (see Annex I for a comparison of the various sustainability disclosures contained under each.</p>
<p>It also attempts to align with the UNCTAD Core Indicators for company reporting on the contribution towards the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. UNCTAD has prepared Guidance on Core indicators for entity reporting on the contribution towards the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to support entities in the provision of information under indicator 12.6.1 and governments in assessing the private sector contribution to the SDGs. The Guidance reflects the Agreed Conclusions of the thirty-fourth session of the Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting (ISAR), which in 2017 requested UNCTAD to develop the guiding document. The UNCTAD Guidance includes detailed definitions and data sources for the core indicators in the company accounts to assist the entities in the reporting.</p>
<p>The purpose is not to create a new reporting standard or framework, but to ensure that the minimum reporting recommendations for Indicator 12.6.1 are aligned with existing global frameworks currently used by companies, so that they may continue to use these frameworks.</p>
<p>While establishing a minimum recommendations in terms of reporting enables companies disclosing meaningful information on all aspects of sustainability to be counted towards the indicator, it could be perceived as giving the message that the minimum suffices and that companies do not need to go beyond it. </p>
<p>Therefore, it is proposed that the methodology include an advanced level, with a further set of disclosure elements, which would further provide impetus for examining and reporting on the sustainability practices and impacts of the company. These include: 1) stakeholder engagement, 2) assessing impacts beyond the company boundaries and along the supply chain; 3) supplier and consumer engagement on sustainability issues; 4) procurement and sourcing practices; and 5) environmental performance information in the form of intensity values to be monitored over time, such as consumption of energy, water or materials per unit of production or per unit of profit.</p>
<p>Having different levels will also allow for information to be collected on the degree of reporting of different companies, including whether the same companies produce more ambitious reports, and go further in their sustainability practices with time, such as through supplier engagement. It would allow for companies who are beginning to produce sustainability reports to provide incentive, through their inclusion in the indicator count, for them to work towards more ambitious reporting and demonstrate their progress over time.</p></div><a name="UNIT_MEASURE"></a><div id="UNIT_MEASURE"><p class="concept-name">2.b.

  <li>While common definitions of company size, industries (defined below), etc. are required to be used by the custodian agencies for analysis and aggregation at regional and global levels and reporting to the SDGs Report, national governments may choose to use different definitions for their own analysis and reporting, such as for their Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs). Filters will be included on the online platform for the database which will allow governments and other users to filter information according to their own national definitions.</li>

Rationale</p><p>While the private sector has a critical role to play in the attainment of the SDGs, Target 12.6 and Indicator 12.6.1 are the only ones specifically monitoring the practices of private sector entities. While Indicator 12.6.1 counts the number of companies producing &#x201C;sustainability reports&#x201D;, the custodian agencies consider the indicator an important opportunity not only to monitor and promote the growth in sustainability reporting globally, but also to monitor and promote high quality reporting, promote the integration of sustainability information into the annual reporting cycle of companies, and promote sustainability practices by companies (as mentioned in the Target under which the indicator falls). Attempts have therefore been made to integrate all of these aspects into the methodology, to the extent possible to encourage companies to advance the quality of sustainability reporting by disclosing baseline indicators across economic, environmental, social and institutional dimensions (for more details, please consult Minimum and Advanced recommendations below)</p></div><a name="REC_USE_LIM"></a><div id="REC_USE_LIM"><p class="concept-name">4.b.

Data availability and disaggregation</p><p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>
<p>Data on number of companies reports are available for all member states that have companies publishing sustainability information, as defined by the indicator. </p>
<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>
<p>The reporting on this indicator is annual, given that most companies publish sustainability information on an annual basis.</p>
<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>
<p>The platform will generate the following information for each country, then aggregate per sub-region, region and globally (avoiding double-counting of companies during the aggregation): </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Total number of companies publishing reports that:</strong></li>
  <li>Meet the minimum reporting recommendations </li>
  <li>Meet the advanced level reporting recommendations</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Inclusion of a company under a specific country</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It is proposed that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multi-national companies are included in the country in which they are listed, or in the country where the head office is found. </li>
  <li>When a multinational company produces specific separate reports, with disaggregated information per country, for the different countries they operate in, these would be counted separately under the indicator count for each country.</li>
  <li><strong>Data disaggregated per company size</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Company sizes are currently defined differently in different jurisdictions. For Indicator 12.6.1, a simple split of &#x2018;large&#x2019; and &#x2018;small&#x2019; could be proposed, with large being more than 250 employees, and small and medium being less than 250 employees. This is in line with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), UN Global Compact definitions, and is the most frequent definition at the national level in terms of employee number. No minimum turnover requirement is prescribed due to the wide variation in turnover of companies of this size between countries. </p>
<p>This is the definition of a company size that will be used by the custodian agencies for aggregation and comparability of data and analysis of trends at sub-regional, regional and global levels. </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data disaggregated per sector</strong></li>
  <li>UNCTAD and UNEPpropose to use the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) (first level classification) to provide information on the number of companies publishing sustainability reports per industry.</li>
