<p>The indicator measures the progress towards national targets established in accordance with Aichi Biodiversity Target 2 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020: By 2020, at the latest, biodiversity values have been integrated into national and local development and poverty reduction strategies and planning processes and are being incorporated into national accounting, as appropriate, and reporting systems.</p>
<p>The indicator is divided in two sub-indicators: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>15.9.1(a): </strong><em>Number of countries that established national targets in accordance with Aichi Biodiversity Target 2 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 in their national biodiversity strategy and action plans and the progress reported towards these targets.</em></li>
  <li><strong>15.9.1(b):</strong><em> Integration of biodiversity into national accounting and reporting systems, defined as implementation of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Biodiversity</u></strong></p>
<p>The 1992 United Nations Earth Summit defined &quot;biological diversity&quot; as &quot;the variability among living organisms from all sources, including, <em>inter alia</em>, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part: this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems&quot;.</p>
<p><strong><u>Aichi Biodiversity Target 2</u></strong></p>
<p>Aichi Biodiversity Target 2 is under Strategic Goal A of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, which addresses the underlying causes of biodiversity loss by mainstreaming biodiversity across government and society.</p>
<p>Aichi Biodiversity Target 2: By 2020, at the latest, biodiversity values have been integrated into national and local development and poverty reduction strategies and planning processes and are being incorporated into national accounting, as appropriate,<strong> </strong>and reporting systems.</p>
<p><strong><u>NBSAPs</u></strong></p>
<p>In accordance with Article 6 of the Convention on Biological Diversity, Parties are obligated to develop national biodiversity strategies and action plans, and integrate biodiversity considerations into relevant sectoral or cross-sectoral plans, programmes and policies. The National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) is intended to define the current status of biodiversity, the threats leading to its degradation and the strategies and priority actions to ensure its conservation and sustainable use within the framework of the socio-economic development of the country.</p>
<p><strong><u>National Reports</u></strong></p>
<p>In accordance with Article 26 of the Convention on Biological Diversity, Parties are obligated to provide information on measures taken towards the implementation of the Convention and its strategic plans, as reflected in the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP), as well as on the effectiveness of these measures. The format for the sixth national reports requested that Parties, among other things, provide an assessment of their progress towards their national targets and/or the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. These national reports are publicly available on the Convention&#x2019;s Clearing-House Mechanism, which is constantly being improved to enhance usability by Parties and better contribute to assessment of the implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the achievement of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.</p>
<p><strong>The system of environmental-economic accounting</strong> is presented by two international statistical standards: the System for Environmental-Economic Accounting Central Framework (SEEA-CF), adopted in 2012, and the System for Environmental-Economic Accounting-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA), adopted in 2021.</p>
<p><strong><u>SEEA-CF </u></strong></p>
<p>The System for Environmental-Economic Accounting Central Framework (SEEA-CF) is an international statistical standard for measuring the environment and its relationship with the economy. It integrates economic and environmental data to provide a more comprehensive and multipurpose view of the interrelationships between the economy and the environment and the stocks and changes in stocks of environmental assets, as they bring benefits to humanity.</p>
<p><strong><u>SEEA-EA </u></strong></p>
<p>The System for Environmental-Economic Accounting-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA) is an integrated statistical framework for organizing biophysical data, measuring ecosystem services in physical and monetary terms, tracking changes in the condition and extent of ecosystem assets and linking this information to economic and other human activity. The SEEA-EA takes the perspective of ecosystems and considers how individual environmental assets interact as part of natural processes within a given spatial area. </p>
<p><strong><u>The Global Assessment of Environmental-Economic Accounting and Supporting Statistics</u></strong></p>
<p>The Global Assessment of Environmental-Economic Accounting and Supporting Statistics is a survey administered by the UNSD under the auspices of the UN Committee of Experts on Environmental Economic Accounting (UNCEEA). The aim of the Global Assessment is to assess the progress in reaching the implementation targets of the UNCEEA.</p></div><a name="UNIT_MEASURE"></a><div id="UNIT_MEASURE"><p class="concept-name">2.b.

</ol></div><a name="INST_MANDATE"></a><div id="INST_MANDATE"><p class="concept-name">3.g. Institutional mandate</p><p><strong>Sub-indicator (a)</strong>: In decision X/2, the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, urged Parties to develop national and regional targets, using the Strategic Plan 2011-2020 and its Aichi Targets, as a flexible framework, in accordance with national priorities and capacities and taking into account both the global targets and the status and trends of biological diversity in the country, and the resources provided through the strategy for resource mobilization, with a view to contributing to collective global efforts to reach the global targets, and report thereon to the Conference of the Parties at its eleventh meeting. In the same decision, the Conference of the Parties requested the Executive Secretary of the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity to prepare an analysis/synthesis of national, regional and other actions, including targets as appropriate, established in accordance with the Strategic Plan, to enable the Conference of Parties at its eleventh and subsequent meetings to assess the contribution of such national and regional targets towards the global targets.</p>
<p><strong>Sub-indicator (b)</strong>: For sub-indicator (b), the UNCEEA was established by the UN Statistical Commission at its 36<sup>th</sup> session in March 2005. The UNCEEA functions as an intergovernmental body to provide overall vision, coordination, prioritization and direction in the field of environmental economic accounting and supporting statistics. As Secretariat to the UNCEEA, UNSD administers the Global Assessment on Environmental-Economic Accounting and Supporting Statistics. </p></div><a name="RATIONALE"></a><div id="RATIONALE"><p class="concept-name">4.a. Rationale</p><p>The objective of Aichi Biodiversity Target 2 is to ensure that the diverse values of biodiversity and opportunities derived from its conservation and sustainable use are recognized and reflected in all relevant public and private decision-making processes.</p>
<p><strong>Sub-indicator (a)</strong>:<strong> </strong>National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans are described in Article 6 of the Convention on Biological Diversity on General Measures for Conservation and Sustainable Use. Under this article, it is stated that &#x201C;each Party to the Convention shall, in accordance with its particular conditions and capabilities: (a) Develop national strategies, plans or programmes for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity or adapt for this purpose existing strategies, plans or programmes which shall reflect, <em>inter alia</em>, the measures set out in this Convention relevant to the Contracting Party concerned; and (b) Integrate, as far as possible and as appropriate, the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity into relevant sectoral or cross-sectoral plans, programmes and policies&#x201D;. Further, under Article 26, it is stated that &#x201C;each Contracting Party shall, at intervals to be determined by the Conference of the Parties, present to the Conference of the Parties, reports on measures which it has taken for the implementation of the provisions of this Convention and their effectiveness in meeting the objectives of this Convention&#x201D;.</p>
<p><strong>Sub-indicator (b)</strong>:<strong> </strong>Integration of biodiversity values into national accounting and reporting systems can be achieved through implementation of the international statistical standard, the System for Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA). The SEEA Central Framework (SEEA CF) was adopted by the UN Statistical Commission in 2012 as the first international standard for environmental-economic accounting. In addition, the SEEA Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA EA) was endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission in 2021. Results of the Global Assessment of Environmental-Economic Accounting and Supporting Statistics provide the data needed for Sub-indicator (b) of the indicator.</p></div><a name="REC_USE_LIM"></a><div id="REC_USE_LIM"><p class="concept-name">4.b. Comment and limitations</p><p><strong>Sub-indicator (a)</strong>: The assessment of national targets has several limitations stemming from the different approaches Parties have taken in setting national targets and in reporting against them. Parties have mapped their national targets to the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in different ways and based on different information. For example, some have established one national target for each of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, while others have set multiple national targets for one Aichi Biodiversity Target. Some Parties have set process-related targets, some have set outcome-oriented targets, and some have used a combination of the two. This has necessitated different approaches at the national level in evaluating progress. These varying national approaches are not necessarily comparable. Similarly, some countries have set national targets which relate to multiple Aichi Biodiversity Targets. Further, some Parties have chosen to report against the Aichi Biodiversity Targets rather than towards their national biodiversity targets and some have reported against the Aichi Biodiversity Targets as they have not developed distinct national targets. The different approaches in national target-setting and reporting present challenges to undertaking analysis in a systematic manner. </p>
<p><strong>Sub-indicator (b)</strong>: The SEEA EA was adopted in March 2021, and the way that the SEEA EA is implemented by countries is expected to develop over time. In addition, the extent to which specific SEEA accounts relate to biodiversity differs, and some accounts relate more directly to biodiversity than others. Thus, the extent to which certain SEEA accounts directly integrate biodiversity into national accounting and reporting systems will also differ.</p></div><a name="DATA_COMP"></a><div id="DATA_COMP"><p class="concept-name">4.c. Method of computation</p><p><strong>Sub-indicator (a)</strong>: The sixth national reports provide semi-quantitative information on progress made in achieving the national targets and/or the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, which is amenable to the development of a scoring system. The progress assessment for Aichi Biodiversity Target 2 would thus provide critical information for indicator 15.9.1. </p>
<p>Real-time information is available from the Convention&#x2019;s Clearing-House Mechanism (<a href="https://chm.cbd.int/search/reporting-map?filter=AICHI-TARGET-02">https://chm.cbd.int/search/reporting-map?filter=AICHI-TARGET-02</a>). The latest analysis is contained in document CBD/SBI/3/2/Add.2 (<a href="https://www.cbd.int/doc/c/f1e4/ab2c/ff85fe53e210872a0ceffd26/sbi-03-02-add2-en.pdf">https://www.cbd.int/doc/c/f1e4/ab2c/ff85fe53e210872a0ceffd26/sbi-03-02-add2-en.pdf</a>). An assessment of the data is also presented in the fifth edition of the Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO-5) (<a href="https://www.cbd.int/gbo5">https://www.cbd.int/gbo5</a>).</p>
<p>The CBD Secretariat collects data from the National Reports as follows: </p>
<p>Parties establish national targets based on the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in their National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) and report progress against these national targets in their sixth national report. The template for the sixth national reports allows Parties to check one of the progress labels below (the online reporting framework assigns numbers to each of the progress labels as indicated). Hence, the system is based on self-reporting by Parties and is consistent with the established reporting template. See Table 1 below.</p>

<p><strong>Sub-indicator (b)</strong>: The Global Assessment of Environmental-Economic Accounting and Supporting Statistics collects information on whether countries are currently planning or implementing SEEA accounts, the specific accounts being implemented and plans for new/future accounts. Sub-indicator (b) is defined as the number of countries, which indicate they have implemented any SEEA Central Framework or SEEA Ecosystem Accounting accounts in their response to the Global Assessment. The sub-indicator uses the definition of implementation put forth by the UNCEEA, which disaggregates implementation into three progressive stages:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Compilation: A country falls into this stage if it has compiled at least one account (which is consistent with the SEEA) over the past five years.</li>
  <li>Dissemination: A country falls into this stage if it has compiled and published at least one account within the past five years. </li>
  <li>Regular compilation and dissemination: A country falls into this stage if it regularly publishes at least one account. Regularly published accounts are compiled and published according to a scheduled production cycle (which may differ by account).</li>
</ol>
<p>These stages will be scored as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>No compilation</li>
  <li>Compilation</li>
  <li>Dissemination</li>
  <li>Regular compilation and dissemination</li>

  <li><strong>At country level</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sub-indicator (a)</strong>: Missing values are not imputed. </p>
<p><strong>Sub-indicator (b)</strong>: Missing values will occur if a country does not respond to the Global Assessment. If a country does not respond, missing values will be imputed if the custodian agency can find evidence of implementation, such as online publications of SEEA accounts, or based on information gathered from international organizations on the compilation of SEEA accounts. In particular:</p>
<p> -If a national statistical office or other government institution has published a SEEA account which is easily accessible online, this country will be imputed as compiling the SEEA. Since no assumption can be made that the country regularly compiles and publishes the account, this country would fall under Stage II.</p>
<p> -If the custodian agency finds that a country compiles SEEA accounts through a project or other implementation programme and verifies this with the international organizations involved, this country will be imputed as compiling the SEEA under Stage I or Stage II as appropriate.</p>
<p>In all cases, imputation is only be done as a secondary step after first contacting countries. All imputations will be clearly flagged for users as imputations by UNSD. </p>

  <li><strong>At regional and global levels</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sub-indicator (a)</strong>: Missing values are considered to be 0 as this indicator refers to reporting processes. Thus if a country does not report it is assumed that there is no corresponding national target.</p>
