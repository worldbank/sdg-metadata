msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Reducing adolescent fertility and addressing the multiple factors "
"underlying it are essential for improving sexual and reproductive health "
"and the social and economic well-being of adolescents. There is substantial "
"agreement in the literature that women who become pregnant and give birth "
"very early in their reproductive lives are subject to higher risks of "
"complications or even death during pregnancy and birth and their children "
"are also more vulnerable. Therefore, preventing births very early in a "
"woman&#x2019;s life is an important measure to improve maternal health and "
"reduce infant mortality. Furthermore, women having children at an early age "
"experience a curtailment of their opportunities for socio-economic "
"improvement, particularly because young mothers are unlikely to keep on "
"studying and, if they need to work, may find it especially difficult to "
"combine family and work responsibilities. The adolescent birth rate also "
"provides indirect evidence on access to pertinent health services since "
"young people, and, in particular unmarried adolescent women, often "
"experience difficulties in access to sexual and reproductive health "
"services.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>Discrepancies between the sources of data at the country level are "
"common and the level of the adolescent birth rate depends in part on the "
"source of the data selected.</p>\n"
"<p>For civil registration, rates are subject to limitations which depend on "
"the completeness of birth registration, the treatment of infants born alive "
"but that die before registration or within the first 24 hours of life, the "
"quality of the reported information relating to age of the mother, and the "
"inclusion of births from previous periods. The population estimates may "
"suffer from limitations connected to age misreporting and coverage.</p>\n"
"<p>For survey and census data, both the numerator and denominator come from "
"the same population. The main limitations concern age misreporting, birth "
"omissions, misreporting the date of birth of the child, and sampling "
"variability in the case of surveys.</p>\n"
"<p>With respect to estimates of the adolescent birth rate among females "
"aged 10-14 years, comparative evidence suggests that a very small "
"proportion of births in this age group occur to females below age 12. Other "
"evidence based on retrospective birth history data from surveys indicates "
"that women aged 15-19 years are less likely to report first births before "
"age 15 than women from the same birth cohort when asked five years later at "
"ages 20&#x2013;24 years.</p>\n"
"<p>The adolescent birth rate is commonly reported as the age-specific "
"fertility rate for ages 15-19 years in the context of calculation of total "
"fertility estimates. It has also been called adolescent fertility rate. A "
"related measure is the proportion of adolescent fertility measured as the "
"percentage of total fertility contributed by women aged 15-19.</p>"

msgctxt "DATA_COMP"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>The adolescent birth rate is computed as a ratio. The numerator is the "
"number of live births to women aged 15-19 years, and the denominator an "
"estimate of exposure to childbearing by women aged 15-19 years. The "
"computation is the same for the age group 10-14 years. The numerator and "
"the denominator are calculated differently for civil registration, survey "
"and census data.</p>\n"
"<p>In the case of civil registration data, the numerator is the registered "
"number of live births born to women aged 15-19 years during a given year, "
"and the denominator is the estimated or enumerated population of women aged "
"15-19 years.</p>\n"
"<p>In the case of survey data, the numerator is the number of live births "
"obtained from retrospective birth histories of the interviewed women who "
"were 15-19 years of age at the time of the births during a reference period "
"before the interview, and the denominator is person-years lived between the "
"ages of 15 and 19 years by the interviewed women during the same reference "
"period. The reported observation year corresponds to the middle of the "
"reference period. For some surveys without data on retrospective birth "
"histories, computation of the adolescent birth rate is based on the date of "
"last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the "
"survey.</p>\n"
"<p>With census data, the adolescent birth rate is computed on the basis of "
"the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding "
"the enumeration. The census provides both the numerator and the denominator "
"for the rates. In some cases, the rates based on censuses are adjusted for "
"under-registration based on indirect methods of estimation. For some "
"countries with no other reliable data, the own-children method of indirect "
"estimation provides estimates of the adolescent birth rate for a number of "
"years before the census.</p>\n"
"<p>If data are available, adolescent fertility at ages 10-14 years can also "
"be computed.</p>\n"
