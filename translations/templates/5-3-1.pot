"      <li>UNICEF undertakes a wide consultative process of compiling and "
"assessing data from national sources for the purposes of updating its "
"global databases on the situation of children. Up until 2017, the mechanism "
"UNICEF used to collaborate with national authorities on ensuring data "

"children was known as Country Data Reporting on the Indicators for the "
"Goals (CRING).</li>\n"
"      <li>As of 2018, UNICEF launched a new country consultation process "
"with national authorities on selected child-related global SDG indicators "
"it is custodian or co-custodian to meet emerging standards and guidelines "
"on data flows for global reporting of SDG indicators, which place strong "
"emphasis on technical rigour, country ownership and use of official data "
"and statistics. The consultation process solicited feedback directly from "
"National Statistical Offices, as well as other government agencies "
"responsible for official statistics, on the compilation of the indicators, "
"including the data sources used, and the application of internationally "
"agreed definitions, classification and methodologies to the data from that "

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>Marriage before the age of 18 is a fundamental violation of human "
"rights. Child marriage often compromises a girl&#x2019;s development by "
"resulting in early pregnancy and social isolation, interrupting her "
"schooling, limiting her opportunities for career and vocational advancement "
"and placing her at increased risk of intimate partner violence. In many "
"cultures, girls reaching puberty are expected to assume gender roles "
"associated with womanhood. These include entering a union and becoming a "
"mother. </p>\n"
"<p>The practice of early/child marriage is a direct manifestation of gender "
"inequality. </p>\n"
"<p>The issue of child marriage is addressed in a number of international "
"conventions and agreements. Although marriage is not mentioned directly in "
"the Convention on the Rights of the Child, child marriage is linked to "
"other rights &#x2013; such as the right to freedom of expression, the right "
"to protection from all forms of abuse, and the right to be protected from "
"harmful traditional practices.</p>"

"<p>UNICEF maintains the global database on child marriage that is used for "
"SDG and other official reporting. Before the inclusion of any data point in "
"the database, it is reviewed by technical focal points at UNICEF "
"headquarters to check for consistency and overall data quality. This review "
"is based on a set of objective criteria to ensure that only the most recent "
"and reliable information are included in the databases. These criteria "
"include the following: data sources must include proper documentation; data "
"values must be representative at the national population level; data are "
"collected using an appropriate methodology (e.g., sampling); data values "
"are based on a sufficiently large sample; data conform to the standard "
"indicator definition including age group and concepts, to the extent "
"possible; data are plausible based on trends and consistency with "
"previously published/reported estimates for the indicator. </p>\n"
"<p>As of 2018, UNICEF undertakes an annual consultation with government "
