"<p><strong>Definition: </strong></p>\n"
"<p>The prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) (French: pourcentage de "
"sous-alimentation; Spanish: porcentaje de sub-alimentaci&#xF3;n; Italian: "
"prevalenza di sotto-alimentazione) is an estimate of the proportion of the "
"population whose habitual food consumption is insufficient to provide the "
"dietary energy levels that are required to maintain a normal active and "
"healthy life. It is expressed as a percentage. </p>\n"
"<p><strong>Concepts: </strong></p>\n"
"<p>Undernourishment is defined as the condition by which a person has "
"access, on a regular basis, to amounts of food that are insufficient to "
"provide the energy required for conducting a normal, healthy and active "
"life, given his or her own dietary energy requirements. </p>\n"
"<p>Though strictly related, &#x201C;undernourishment&#x201D; as defined "
"here is different from the physical conditions of "
"&#x201C;malnutrition&#x201D; and &#x201C;undernutrition&#x201D; as it "
"refers to the condition of insufficient intake of food, rather than to the "
"outcome in terms of nutritional status. In French, Spanish and Italian the "
"difference is marked by the use of the terms alimentation, "
"alimentaci&#xF3;n, or alimentazione, instead of nutrition, nutrici&#xF3;n "
"or nutrizione, in the name of the indicator. A more appropriate expression "
"in English that would render the precise meaning of the indicator might "
"have been &#x201C;prevalence of under-feeding&#x201D; but by now the term "
"&#x201C;undernourishment&#x201D; has long been associated with the "
"indicator. </p>\n"
"<p>While the undernourishment condition applies to individuals, due to "
"conceptual and data-related considerations, the indicator can only be "
"referred to a population, or group of individuals. The prevalence of "
"undernourishment is thus an estimate of the percentage of individuals in a "
"group that are in that condition, but it does not allow for the "
"identification of which individuals in the group are, in fact, "
"undernourished. </p>"

"<p>The ideal source of data to estimate the PoU would be a carefully "
"designed and skillfully conducted individual dietary intake survey, in "
"which actual daily food consumption, together with heights and weights for "
"each surveyed individual, are repeatedly measured on a sample that is "
"representative of the target population. Due to their cost, however, such "
"surveys are rare.</p>\n"
"<p>In principle, a well-designed household survey that collects information "
"on food acquisitions might be sufficient to inform a reliable estimate of "
"the Prevalence of Undernourishment in a population, at a reasonable cost "
"and with the necessary periodicity to inform the SDG monitoring process, "
"provided that: </p>\n"
"<ol>\n"
"  <li>All sources of food consumption for all members of the households are "
"properly accounted for, including, in particular, food that is consumed "
"away from home; </li>\n"
"  <li>Sufficient information is available to convert the data on food "
"consumption or on food expenditures into their contribution to dietary "
"energy intake; </li>\n"
"  <li>The proper methods to compute the PoU are used, to control for excess "
"variability in the estimated levels of habitual food consumption across "
"households, allowing for the presence on normal variability in the "
"distribution of food consumption across individuals, induced by the "
"differences in energy requirements of the members of the population. </li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"<p>Examples of surveys that could be considered for this purpose include "
"surveys conducted to compute economic statistics and conduct poverty "
"assessments, such as Household Income and Expenditure Surveys, Household "
"Budget Surveys and Living Standard Measurement Surveys. </p>\n"
"<p>In practice, however, it is often impossible, and not advisable, to rely "
"only on data collected through a household survey, as the information "
"needed to estimate the four parameters of the PoU model is either missing "

msgid ""
"<p><strong>Rationale: </strong></p>\n"
"<p>The indicator has been used by FAO to monitor the World Food Summit "
"Target and the MDG Target 1C, at national, regional and global level, since "
"1999. It allows monitoring trends in the extent of dietary energy "
"inadequacy in a population over time, generated as a result of the "
"combination of changes in the overall availability of food, in the "
"households&#x2019; ability to access it, and in the socio-demographic "
"characteristics of the population, as well as differences across countries "
"and regions in any given moment in time. </p>\n"
"<p>The parametric approach adopted by FAO allows obtaining reliable "
"estimated for relatively large population groups. As it reflects a severe "
"condition of lack of food, it is fully consistent with the spirit of a Goal "
"that aims at reducing hunger. </p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<p><strong>Comments and limitations: </strong></p>\n"
"<p>Over the years, the parametric approach informing the computation of the "
"PoU has been criticized, based on the presumptions that undernourishment "
"should be assessed necessarily starting at the individual level, by "
"comparing individual energy requirements with individual energy intakes. "
"According to such view, the prevalence of undernourishment could be simply "
"computed by counting the number of individuals in a representative sample "
"of the population that is classified as undernourished, based on a "
"comparison of individual habitual food consumption and requirements. "
"Unfortunately, such approach is not feasible for two reasons: first, due to "
"the cost of individual dietary intake surveys, individual food consumption "
"is measured only in a few countries, every several years, on relatively "
"small samples; moreover, individual energy requirements are practically "
"unobservable with standard data collection methods (to the point that "
"observed habitual energy consumption of individuals in a healthy status is "
"still the preferred way to infer individual energy requirements). This "
"means that even if it were possible to obtain accurate observations of the "
"individual dietary energy consumption, this would be insufficient to infer "
"on the undernourishment condition at individual level, unless integrated by "
"the observation on the physical status (body mass index) and of its dynamic "
"over time, of the same individual. </p>\n"
"<p>The model based approach to estimate the PoU developed by FAO integrates "
"information that is available with sufficient regularity from different "
"sources for most countries in the world, in a theoretically consistent way, "
"thus providing what is still one of the most reliable tools to monitor "
"progress towards reducing global hunger. </p>\n"
"<p>Further specific consideration </p>\n"
"<ol>\n"
"  <li>Feasibility </li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"<p>Estimation of PoU at national level has been feasible for most countries "
"in the world since 1999. In the worst case scenario, when no data on food "
"consumption was available from a recent household survey, the model-based "
"estimate of the PoU is informed by an estimate of mean level of dietary "
"energy consumption (DEC) from Food Balance Sheets (FBS), an indirect "
"estimate of the coefficient of variation (CV) based on information on the "
"country&#x2019;s GDP, Gini coefficient of Income, an index of the relative "
"price of food, or other indicators of development such as country&#x2019;s "
"Under 5 Mortality Rate, and an estimate of the Minimum Dietary Energy "
"Requirement (MDER) based on the UN Population Division&#x2019;s World "
"Population Prospects data. </p>\n"
"<ol>\n"
"  <li>Reliability </li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"<p>Reliability mostly depends on the quality of the data used to inform the "
"estimation of the model&#x2019;s parameters. </p>\n"
"<p>DEC could be estimated either from survey data or from food balances. "
"Neither source is devoid of problems. When comparing estimates of national "
"DEC from FBS and from surveys, differences are frequently noted. </p>\n"
"<p>DEC estimates from survey data can be affected by systematic measurement "
"errors due to under-reporting of food consumption, or to incomplete "
"recording of all food consumption sources. Recent research shows that a "
"negative bias of up to more than 850 kcal can be induced on the estimated "
"daily per capita caloric consumption can be induced by the type of food "
"consumption module chosen to capture the data at the household level. (See "
"De Weerdt et al., 2015, Table 2, <a "
"href=\"https://feb.kuleuven.be/drc/licos/publications/dp/DP%20365%20"
"Complete.pdf%20\">https://feb.kuleuven.be/drc/licos/publications/dp/DP%20365"
"%20Complete.pdf</a> ). A detailed analysis of a recent Household Budget "
"Survey in Brazil revealed how food provided for free through the school "
"meals program and consumed by children while at school, had not been "
"accounted among the sources of household food consumption, accounting for a "
"downward bias of the average per capita daily dietary energy consumption of "
"674 kcal. (See Borlizzi, Cafiero &amp; Del Grossi, forthcoming.) </p>\n"
"<p>DEC estimates from Food Balance Sheets can also be affected by errors, "
"though it is difficult to establish the direction of induced bias. As "
"average food availability is a residual in the FBS method, any errors in "
"reported production, trade, and stocks might affect the estimates of "
"national food availability. Moreover, errors might be induced by the "
"difficulty in properly accounting for all forms of food commodity "
"utilization. To the extent that all these errors are uncorrelated, though, "
"the impact on the estimated average food consumption will be lower than "
"each of the errors, considered separately, might imply. Nevertheless, "
"considering how problematic it is to precisely account for variations in "
"national reserves of food commodities, for which official data may be "
"unreliable, it is recognized that the estimated annual stock variation is "
"prone to considerable uncertainty that would be transferred to the "
"estimated DEC in each given year. </p>\n"
"<p>To limit the impact of such errors, FAO has traditionally presented "
"estimates of PoU at national level as three-year averages, on the "
"presumption that errors induced by imprecise recording of stocks variations "
"in each single year might be highly reduced when considering an average "
"over three consecutive years. </p>\n"
"<p>Survey data are the only source to estimate the CV and Skewness. As "
"described in the section of metadata on the method of computation, unless "
"obtained from high quality individual dietary intake surveys, data needs to "
"be treated to reduce the likely upward bias in the estimates of the CV that "
"would be induced by the spurious variability due to errors in measuring "
"individual habitual dietary energy intake. </p>\n"
"<ol>\n"
"  <li>Comparability </li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"<p>If the same method of computation is used, comparability across time and "
"space is relatively high, with the only potential cause of inhomogeneity "
"found in the different quality of the background data. </p>\n"
"<ol>\n"
"  <li>Limitations </li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"<p>Due to the probabilistic nature of the inference and the margins of "
"uncertainty associated with estimates of each of the parameters in the "
"model, the precision of the PoU estimates is generally low. Even though it "
"is not possible to compute theoretical Margins of Error (MoE) for PoU "
"estimates, these would very likely exceed plus or minus 2.5% in most cases. "
"For this reason, FAO publishes national level PoU estimates only when they "
"are larger than 2.5%. This also suggests that 2.5% is the lowest feasible "
"target that can be set for the PoU indicator, a value that is "
"unsatisfactorily large when the ambition is to fully eradicate the scourge "
"of hunger. </p>\n"
"<p>If no survey is available that collects food consumption data and that "
"is representative at subnational level, the indicator can only be computed "
"at national level.</p>"

"<h1>Methodology </h1>\n"
"<p><strong>Computation method: </strong></p>\n"
"<p>The indicator is computed at the population level. To this aim, the "
"population is represented by an &#x201C;average&#x201D; individual for "
"which a probability distribution of the habitual daily dietary energy "
"intake levels is modelled through a parametric probability density function "
"(pdf). </p>\n"
"<p>Once the pdf is characterized, the indicator is obtained as the "
"cumulative probability that daily habitual dietary energy intakes (x) are "
"below the lower bound of the range of normal dietary energy requirements "
"for that representative, or average individual (MDER), as in the formula "
"below: </p>\n"
"<p>PoU= &#x222B;_(x&lt;MDER) f(x | DEC; CV; Skew) dx </p>\n"
"<p>where DEC, CV and Skew are the mean, coefficient of variation and "
"skewness that characterize the distribution of habitual dietary energy "
"consumption levels in the population. </p>\n"
"<p>Until 2012, the probability distribution f(x) was modelled as a "
"Log-normal pdf, informed by only two parameters: mean and coefficient of "
"variation. In its most recent formulation, it is modelled as a "
"three-parameter pdf, able to represent different degrees of skewness, "
"ranging from that of a symmetric Normal distribution to that of the "
"positively skewed Log-normal distribution. The flexibility in capturing "
"different degrees of skewness is needed to take into account the fact that "
"human energy consumption levels are naturally bounded by physiological "
"limits. It is thus conceivable that, as mean consumption levels increases, "
"the skewness of the distribution decreases, gradually moving from "
"(positively skewed) Log-normal distributions, typical of populations where "
"average food consumption is relatively low, towards (symmetric) Normal "
"distributions. The skew-normal and skew-lognormal families of distribution "
"allow for the characterization of all possible intermediate degrees of "
"positive skewness. (See <a "
"href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e.pdf%20\">http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e."
"pdf</a> for a detailed description) </p>\n"
"<p>A custom R function is available from the Statistics Division at FAO to "
"compute the PoU, given the four parameters DEC, CV, Skew and MDER. </p>\n"
"<p>Different data sources can be used to estimate the different parameters "
"of the model. </p>\n"
"<p>DEC </p>\n"
"<p>The mean of the distribution of dietary energy consumption levels for "
"the average individual in a population (DEC) corresponds, by definition, to "
"the average, daily per capita food consumption level in the population. "
"</p>\n"
"<p>DEC can be estimated from data on food consumption obtained through "
"surveys that are representative of the population of interest. Depending on "
"the survey design, they can be used to estimate DEC at national and at sub "
"national levels, either by geographic areas or by socio-economic population "
"groups. Unfortunately, though the situation is rapidly improving, "
"representative surveys that collect food consumption data are still not "
"available for every country and every year. </p>\n"
"<p>For the national population only, DEC can be estimated also from "
"accounts of the total supply and utilization of all food commodities in a "
"country, where the contribution of each commodity to the availability of "
"food for human consumption is expressed in their dietary energy content, "
"and their total is divided by the size of the population. The major source "
"of data on national food balances are the Food Balance Sheets (FBS) "
"maintained by FAO for most countries in the world (see <a "
"href=\"http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/fbs/en/\">http://www.fao.org/"
"economic/ess/fbs/en/</a>), informed by official data reported by member "
"countries, and disseminated through FAOSTAT (<a "
"href=\"http://faostat3.fao.org/download/FB/*/E\">http://faostat3.fao.org/"
"download/FB/*/E</a>) </p>\n"
"<p>CV </p>\n"
"<p>Surveys that contain information on food consumption at individual or "
"household level are the only available source to directly estimate the CV "
"of habitual food consumption for the representative individual in the "
"population. Unfortunately, survey data on food consumption are fraught by "
"many problems that complicate the reliable estimation of CV. </p>\n"
"<p>In principle, repeated observations of daily consumption for each "
"individual in a sample would be needed to estimate levels of habitual "
"consumption and to control for measurement errors. Moreover, data should be "
"collected in different periods of the year on the same individuals or "
"households to account for possible seasonal variation in levels of dietary "
"energy consumption. Due to their cost, nationally representative individual "
"dietary intake surveys with such characteristics are very rare, and "
"virtually inexistent for most developing countries. As a consequence, the "
"most common sources of data to estimate CV are multipurpose household "
"surveys, such as Living Standard Measurement Surveys, Household Incomes and "
"Expenditure Surveys (or Household Budgets Survey), that collect also "
"information on food consumption. When using data collected at household "
"level however, careful attention should be taken in distinguishing levels "
"of food purchases or acquisitions from levels of actual utilization "
"(consumption and wastage) during the identified reference period and in "
"properly recording the number of individuals who participate in "
"consumption; moreover, household level data will mask the variability due "
"to intra-household allocation of food. </p>\n"
"<p>For all these reasons, the coefficient of variation calculated on the "
"series of average per capita daily dietary energy consumption levels "
"recorded for each household included in a survey is never a reliable "
"estimate of CV, which should reflect variability in the levels of habitual "
"(and not occasional) daily dietary energy consumption level, at the "
"individual (and not household) level. Empirical estimates of CV from "
"household survey data are upward biased due to the spurious variability "
"induced by measurement error, differences between occasional and habitual "
"consumption, differences between acquisition and actual consumption and "
"seasonality; moreover, they do not reflect the variability in dietary "
"energy consumption in the population associated with individual "
"characteristics of the household members (such as sex, age, body mass and "
"physical activity levels). </p>\n"
"<p>When using data collected through household surveys, CV is thus best "
"estimated indirectly, controlling for spurious variability, and adjusted to "
"reflect inter-individuals (in addition to inter-households) variability. "
"The simplest way to proceed is to classify households into homogeneous "
"groups and to calculate the coefficient of variation of the average per "
"capita dietary energy consumption across household groups. This yields an "
"estimate of the inter-households component of CV, labelled CV_H. An "
"estimate of the inter-individuals component of the CV, labelled CV_I, is "
"obtained, for each population, from its structure by sex, age and body "
"masses, and the two components are combined to obtain the needed estimate "
"as: </p>\n"
"<p>CV^ = v[(CV_H)^2+(CV_I)^2 )]. </p>\n"
"<p>For countries and years when no data from household survey are "
"available, an indirect estimate of the CV, CV_IND, is obtained via a "
"regression that projects the values of per capita GDP, Gini coefficient of "
"income, and an index of the relative price of food (FPI) on the CV, while "
"controlling for a regional shifter (REG). </p>\n"
"<p>CV^_IND=&#xDF;_0+&#xDF;_1 GDP+ &#xDF;_2 GINI+ &#xDF;_3 FPI+&#xDF;_4 REG. "
"</p>\n"
"<p>Coefficients of the regression are estimated from the set of data and "
"years for which data on CV, GDP, GINI and FPI are available. </p>\n"
"<p>Skew </p>\n"
"<p>As skewness is not strongly affected by the presence of spurious "
"variability, Skew is estimated directly from household level data on the "
"average daily dietary consumption, with the only exception of eliminating "
"rare extremely high or extremely low values. If the empirically estimated "
"skewness exceeds the value that would correspond to the skewness of "
"Log-normal distribution with given mean and coefficient of variation, the "
"parameter is neglected and a two parameter lognormal distribution is used "
"for f(x). (See <a "
"href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e."
"pdf</a> for additional details). </p>\n"
"<p>MDER </p>\n"
"<p>Human energy requirements are computed by multiplying normative "
"requirements for basic metabolic rate (BMR, expressed per kg of body mass) "
"by the ideal weight of a healthy person of given height, and then "
"multiplied by a coefficient of physical activity level (PAL). Ranges of "
"normal energy requirements are thus computed for each sex and age group of "
"the population, observing that there exist a whole range of Body Mass Index "
"(BMI) values &#x2013; from 18.5 to 25 &#x2013; that are compatible with "
"health. This implies that any given attained height might correspond to a "
"whole range of healthy body weights, and therefore to a range of values for "
"energy requirement for BMR. </p>\n"
"<p>Given information on the median height and the consideration that the "
"group might contain individuals engaged in different levels of physical "
"activity, the minimum, average and maximum dietary energy requirement can "
"be computed for every sex and age class by taking into consideration "
"special allowances for growth in individuals aged 0-21 and for pregnancy "
"and lactation. </p>\n"
"<p>(See <a "
"href=\"ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/007/y5686e/y5686e00.pdf\">ftp://ftp.fao."
"org/docrep/fao/007/y5686e/y5686e00.pdf</a> for further details). </p>\n"
"<p>The MDER for a given population group, including for the national "
"population, is obtained as the weighted average of the minimums of the "
"energy requirements ranges of each sex and age class, using the population "
"size in each class as weights. </p>\n"
"<p>In computing the prevalence of dietary energy inadequacy in a population "
"there has often been confusion between the concept of MDER and that of the "
"Recommended Dietary Energy Intake, and regarding the appropriate threshold "
"to be used to compute the probability of inadequacy. The reason why the "
"probability of dietary energy inadequacy should be computed with reference "
"to the MDER, and not the ADER (which, instead, can be used as an estimate "
"of the average recommended dietary intake level for the whole population) "
"is simply to recognize the fact that in any population there exists a "
"certain range of normal variability in requirements; using the ADER as a "
"threshold would greatly overestimate undernourishment as it would count "
"also the proportion of the healthy population that consumes less than "
"average, simply because of having less than average requirements. When "
"needed, the ADER, or the average Recommended Dietary Energy Intake level in "
"a population must be used instead to compute the dietary energy gap.</p>"

"<p><strong>Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation "
"of the data at the national level: </strong></p>\n"
"<p>The main three sources of data at national level are: </p>\n"
"<ol>\n"
"  <li>Official reports on the production, trade and utilization of the "
"major food crop and livestock productions. </li>\n"
"  <li>Household survey data on food consumption </li>\n"
"  <li>Demographic characteristics of the national population </li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"<p>Data sources for agricultural production are usually national surveys "
"that are conducted by the Ministry of Agricultural/Livestock and/or the "
"National Statistical Office. The surveys are usually annual, and in the "
"absence of direct measurements, use information on areas/animal numbers and "
"crop yields/carcass weights to calculate crop or livestock product "
"quantities. Agricultural censuses, which FAO recommends conducting every "
"ten years, may complement these surveys by providing more updated measured "
"data on crops and livestock, and thus enable more precise "
"projections/revisions. </p>\n"
"<p>The data source for agricultural and food trade is almost exclusively "
"the national customs office (with few exceptions where data may be obtained "
"from the Central Bank). Countries often prepare these trade reports "
"following international standard formats (commodity/country "
"classifications, units of measurement, trading partner detail). While such "
"trade data may be considered quite reliable, being the result of direct "
"measurement/reporting by/to the customs office, issues of unreported border "
"trade (and animal movement), misclassification of commodities, "
"confidentiality, time-lag, to name a few, may necessitate some data "
"analysis and validation (often by referring to &#x2018; mirror&#x2019; "
"trade statistics to cross-check quantities and values). </p>\n"
"<p>Data on the utilization of primary and processed crops and livestock may "
"be obtained through specialized surveys (supplemented by research) through "
"the national agri-food industry system. Utilizations of interest here are "
"those quantities destined for, among others, animal feed, for industrial "
"uses (e.g. biofuel production), for national/enterprise/farm stocks, for "
"seed (sowing for the successive agricultural cycle) &#x2013; to enable as "
"accurate an assessment as possible of the quantities destined/available for "
"potential human consumption. </p>\n"
"<p>These datasets (production, trade and utilizations), once cross-checked "
"and validated, form the basis for the compilation of the Food Balance "
"Sheets (FBS). The FBS are an accounting framework whereby supply "
"(production + imports + stock withdrawals) should equal utilization (export "
"+ food processing + feed + seed + industrial use, etc.). It should be noted "
"that, within the FBS framework, post-harvest/slaughter losses (up to the "
"retail level) are considered as utilization, and thus a component in the "
"balancing of the FBS. The FBS framework provides a snapshot of the "
"agricultural supply situation at the national level, and allows for a "
"cross-referenced structure whereby data, official or estimated/imputed, may "
"be further analyzed and validated (e.g. animal numbers may result as being "
"under-reported/estimated). The main result of the compilation of the FBS is "
"the calculation of the Dietary Energy Supply (DES) in kilocalories per "
"person (based on population figures) in a given year (quantities resulting "
"as available for human consumption are converted into their caloric "
"equivalents by using appropriate nutritive conversion factors by "
"commodity). The DES, in the absence of direct consumption data from "
"household surveys, is one of the key components in the calculation of the "
"Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU). FAO is presently embarking on a more "
"focused program of providing FBS capacity to countries, including an "
"updated compilation tool. </p>\n"
"<p>FAO obtains crop/livestock primary/processed production data, and "
"principal utilization thereof, through country-tailored questionnaires that "
"are dispatched to all countries annually. Official country trade statistics "
"are obtained annually through bulk downloads of the United Nations trade "
"database (countries are expected to report to UNSD annually). In some "
"cases, when available, national FBS data are also used. These datasets are "
"then validated and form inputs in the country FBS which FAO compiles. It "
"should be noted that when data are not officially reported/available (as is "
"frequently the case with commodity utilization data), and hence it is "
"necessary to resort to imputations to fill the data gaps. </p>\n"

"<h1>Data Availability </h1>\n"
"<p><strong>Description: </strong></p>\n"
"<p>Since 2017 FAO has reported separate estimates of PoU for 170 countries, "
"distributed as follows: </p>\n"
"<p>World 170 </p>\n"
"<p> Africa 45 </p>\n"
"<p> Northern Africa 5 </p>\n"
"<p> Sub-Saharan Africa 40 </p>\n"

"<p> Southern Asia 8 </p>\n"
"<p> South-Eastern Asia 10 </p>\n"
"<p> Western Asia 14 </p>\n"
"<p> Latin America and the Caribbean 32 </p>\n"
"<p> Caribbean 12 </p>\n"
"<p> Latin America 20 </p>\n"
"<p> Central America 8 </p>\n"
"<p> South America 12 </p>\n"
"<p> Oceania 9</p>\n"
"<p>Australia and New Zealand 2</p>\n"
"<p>Oceania excluding Australia and New Zealand 7</p>\n"
"<p> Northern America and Europe 42</p>\n"
"<p>Northern America 3</p>\n"
"<p>Europe 39</p>\n"
"<p> Eastern Europe 10</p>\n"
"<p> Northern Europe 10</p>\n"
"<p> Southern Europe 12</p>\n"
"<p> Western Europe 7</p>\n"
"<p>While country-level estimates are presented as three-year averages, "
"regional and global estimates are yearly estimates. </p>\n"
"<p><strong>Time series: </strong></p>\n"
"<p>2000 - current </p>\n"
"<p><strong> </strong></p>\n"
"<p><strong>Disaggregation: </strong></p>\n"
"<p>Due to reliance on national Food Balance Sheets data to estimate mean "
"caloric consumption levels in the population, the global monitoring of MDG "
"Target 1C and of the WFS target has been based on estimates of the PoU at "
"national level only. </p>\n"
"<p>In principle, the indicator can be computed for any specific population "
"group, provided sufficient accurate information exists to characterize the "
"model&#x2019;s parameters for that specific group, that is, if data on the "
"group&#x2019;s food consumption levels, age/gender structure and &#x2013; "
"possibly &#x2013; physical activity levels, exist. </p>\n"
"<p>The scope for disaggregation thus crucially depends on the availability "
"of surveys designed to be representative at the level of sub national "
"population groups. Given prevailing practice in the design of national "
"household surveys, sufficient reliable information is seldom available for "
"disaggregation beyond the level of macro area of residence (urban-rural) "
"and of the main Provinces/Divisions in a country. To the extent that most "
"of the used surveys are designed to accurately capture the distribution of "
"income, inference can be drawn on the PoU in different income classes of "
"the population. Gender disaggregation is limited by the possibility to "
"identify and group households by gender-related information (such as sex of "
"the head of the household, or male/female ratio). </p>"

msgctxt "COMPARABILITY"
msgid ""
"<p><strong>Sources of discrepancies: </strong></p>\n"
"<p>Many countries have produced and reported on estimates of the Prevalence "
"of Undernourishment, including in their national MDG Reports, but almost "
"invariably using a different methodology than the one developed by FAO, "
"which makes national figures not comparable to those reported by FAO for "
"global monitoring. </p>\n"
"<p>The most common approach used in preparing national reports has been to "
"calculate the percentage of households for which the average per capita "
"daily dietary energy consumption is found to be below thresholds based on "
"daily Recommended Dietary Intake, usually set at 2,100.00 kcal, based on "
"household survey data. In some cases, also lower thresholds of around "
"1,400.00 kcal have been used, probably as a reaction to the fact that "
"percentages of households reporting average daily consumption of less than "
"2,100.00 kcal per capita were implausibly high estimates of the prevalence "
"of undernourishment. </p>\n"
"<p>Almost without exception, no consideration related to the presence of "
"excess variability in the dietary energy consumption data is made, and the "
"reports reveal limited or no progress in the reduction of PoU over time. "
"</p>\n"
"<p>As discussed in the section on the method of computation, the results "
"obtained through these alternative methods are highly unreliable and almost "
"certainly biased toward overestimation. It is therefore advisable that a "
"concerted effort is made to advocate for use of the FAO methods also in "
"preparation of national reports. FAO stands ready to provide all necessary "
"technical support. </p>"
