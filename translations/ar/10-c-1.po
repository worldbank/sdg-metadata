"<h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>\n"
"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>The target includes two components. The first component is that "
"transaction costs for migrant remittances should be 3% or less by 2030. "
"This transaction cost should be intended as "
"<strong>&#x201C;</strong><strong>Global average total cost of sending $200 "
"(or equivalent in local sending currency) and expressed as % of amount "
"sent&#x201D;.</strong> This indicator is readily available and published on "
"a quarterly basis by the World Bank in the Remittance Prices Worldwide "
"database, which covers 365 country corridors, from 48 sending to 105 "
"receiving countries. The second component is to eliminate corridor where "
"cost is 5% or higher. This should be intended in the sense that it should "
"be possible for remittance senders to send money to the beneficiary for an "
"average cost of 5% or less of the amount sent. For this purpose, it should "
"suffice that in each corridor there are at least 3 services, meeting a "
"defined set of service requirements (including service quality, reach "
"etc.), for which the average is 5% or less.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p><strong><em>International remittance transfer.</em></strong><em> </em>A "
"cross-border person-to-person payment of relatively low value. The "
"transfers are typically recurrent payments by migrant workers (who send "
"money to their families in their home country every month). In the report, "
"the term &#x201C;remittance transfer&#x201D; is used for simplicity (ie it "
"is assumed the transfer is international).</p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Remittance service.</em></strong> A service that enables end "
"users to send and/or receive remittance transfers.</p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Remittance service provider (RSP).</em></strong> An entity, "
"operating as a business, that provides a remittance service for a price to "
"end users, either directly or through agents. These include both banks and "
"money transfer operators, as defined below.</p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Money transfer operator (MTO).</em></strong> A non-deposit "
"taking payment service provider where the service involves payment per "
"transfer (or possibly payment for a set or series of transfers) by the "
"sender to the payment service provider (for example, by cash or bank "
"transfer) &#x2013; i.e. as opposed to a situation where the payment service "
"provider debits an account held by the sender at the payment service "
"provider. MTOs may include both traditional players focusing on delivering "
"funds in cash and innovative players which may adopt a variety of different "
"business models for the delivery of the transactions.</p>\n"
"<p><strong>Price. </strong>The total cost to the end users of sending a "
"remittance transfer (including the fees charged to the sender and the "
"margin by which the exchange rate charged to the end users is above the "
"current interbank exchange rate).</p>"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Data for these indicators have been collected by the World Bank through "
"the Remittance Prices Worldwide (RPW) database since 2008 for the purpose "
"of monitoring the G8 / G20 target on reducing remittance prices. Also known "
"as the &#x201C;5x5 objective&#x201D;, this goal was adopted by the G8 in "
"2009, and it refers to reduction of the global average total cost of "
"migrant remittances by 5 percentage points in 5 years. To achieve this "
"objective, the governments in both sending and receiving countries should "
"consider implementing reforms based upon the General Principles for "
"International Remittances Services by the World Bank/Committee on Payment "
"and Settlement Systems (January 2007). This internationally agreed "
"framework has proven effective in helping reduce the cost of remittances "
"and guiding actions to enhance the efficiency of international remittances. "
"The World Bank&#x2019;s RPW database is the only global database that "
"monitors remittance prices across all regions of the world. RPW was "
"launched by the World Bank in September 2008, and is a key tool in "
"monitoring the evolution of costs to the remitters and the beneficiaries "
"from sending and receiving money in major country corridors.</p>"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>Data is collected through a mystery shopping exercise of remittance "
"service providers (RSPs). A sample of RSPs including at least 80% of the "
"market share in each corridor are included in the mystery shopping "
"exercise. The average cost is calculated as the simple average of total "
"costs (including both fee and exchange rate margin) quoted by each RSP "
"operating in a corridor.</p>\n"
"<p>In 2016, introduced the Smart Remitter Target (SmarRT) to monitor "
"remittance transactions at a more granular level. It aims to reflect the "
"cost that a savvy consumer with access to sufficiently complete information "
"would pay to transfer remittances in each corridor. SmaRT is calculated as "
"the simple average as the three cheapest services for sending the "
"equivalent of $200 in each corridor and is expressed in terms of the "
"percentage of the total amount sent. In addition to transparency, services "
"must meet additional criteria to be included in SmaRT, including "
"transaction speed (5 days or less) and accessibility (determined by "
"geographic proximity of branches for services that require physical "
"presence, or access to any technology or device necessary to use the "
"service, such as a bank account, mobile phone or the internet. </p>\n"
"<p>For additional information on the methodology of SmaRT, please see: <a "

"methodology.pdf\">https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/sites/default/"
"files/smart_methodology.pdf</a> </p>\n"
"<p>Target 10.c.1 includes two components, which require two separate "
"calculations:</p>\n"
"<ol>\n"
"  <li>Global average of remittance costs to be reduced to less than 3 "
"percent: this is calculated as the simple average of the total cost for all "
"services included in the RPW database</li>\n"
"  <li>Enabling remittance senders in all corridors to send money to their "
"receivers at a cost of 5 percent or less: this is calculated as the average "
"cost of the three cheapest available services in each corridor which meet a "
"defined set of minimum requirements, as described in the World Bank SmaRT "
"methodology. The target is that the SmaRT average for all corridors should "
"be 5 percent or lower.</li>\n"
