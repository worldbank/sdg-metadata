"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator refers to the number of countries that have national "
"statistical legislation that complies with the Fundamental Principles of "
"Official Statistics. This refers to the number of countries that have a "
"statistical legislation which respects the principles of UNFOP.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p><strong>National statistical legislation:</strong> The statistics law "
"defines rules, regulation, measures with regard to the organization, "
"management, monitoring and inspection of the statistical activities in a "
"systematic way, strength, effectiveness and efficiency to assure the full "
"coverage, accuracy and consistency with facts in order to provide reference "
"for policy direction, socio economic planning, and contribute to the "
"country&#x2019;s development to achieve wealth, culture, well-being and "
"equity.</p>\n"
"<p><strong>UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>The Fundamental Principles for Official Statistics adopted by the United "
"Nations Statistical Commission, in its Special Session of 11-15 April 1994 "
"are:</p>\n"
"<p><strong>Principle 1.</strong> Official statistics provide an "
"indispensable element in the information system of a society, serving the "
"government, the economy and the public with data about the economic, "
"demographic, social and environmental situation. To this end, official "
"statistics that meet the test of practical utility are to be compiled and "
"made available on an impartial basis by official statistical agencies to "
"honour citizens&#x2019; entitlement to public information.</p>\n"
"<p><strong>Principle 2.</strong> To retain trust in official statistics, the "
"statistical agencies need to decide according to strictly professional "
"considerations, including scientific principles and professional ethics, on "
"the methods and procedures for the collection, processing, storage and "
"presentation of statistical data.</p>\n"
"<p><strong>Principle 3.</strong> To facilitate a correct interpretation of "
"the data, the statistical agencies are to present information according to "
"scientific standards on the sources, methods and procedures of the "
"statistics.</p>\n"
"<p><strong>Principle 4.</strong> The statistical agencies are entitled to "
"comment on erroneous interpretation and misuse of statistics. </p>\n"
"<p><strong>Principle 5</strong>. Data for statistical purposes may be drawn "
"from all types of sources, be they statistical surveys or administrative "
"records. Statistical agencies are to choose the source with regard to "
"quality, timeliness, costs and the burden on respondents. </p>\n"
"<p><strong>Principle 6</strong>. Individual data collected by statistical "
"agencies for statistical compilation, whether they refer to natural or legal "
"persons, are to be strictly confidential and used exclusively for "
"statistical purposes. </p>\n"
"<p><strong>Principle 7.</strong> The laws, regulations and measures under "
"which the statistical systems operate are to be made public. </p>\n"
"<p><strong>Principle 8.</strong> Coordination among statistical agencies "
"within countries is essential to achieve consistency and efficiency in the "
"statistical system. </p>\n"
"<p><strong>Principle 9.</strong> The use by statistical agencies in each "
"country of international concepts, classifications and methods promotes the "
"consistency and efficiency of statistical systems at all official levels. </"
"p>\n"
"<p><strong>Principle 10</strong>. Bilateral and multilateral cooperation in "
"statistics contributes to the improvement of systems of official statistics "
"in all countries.</p>"
