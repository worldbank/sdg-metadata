"<p>The national poverty rate is the percentage of the total population "

"percentage of the rural population living below the national poverty line "
"(or in cases where a separate, rural poverty line is used, the rural "

"<p>In assessing poverty in a given country, and how best to reduce poverty "
"according to national definitions, one naturally focuses on a poverty line "
"that is considered appropriate for that country. Poverty lines across "
"countries vary in terms of their purchasing power, and they have a strong "
"economic gradient, such that richer countries tend to adopt higher "
"standards of living in defining poverty. Within a country, the cost of "
"living is typically higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Some "
"countries may have separate urban and rural poverty lines to represent "

"<p>Another source is World Bank&#x2019;s Poverty Assessments. The World "
"Bank periodically prepares poverty assessments of countries in which it has "
"an active program, in close collaboration with national institutions, other "
"development agencies, and civil society groups, including poor "
"people&#x2019;s organizations. Poverty assessments report the extent and "
"causes of poverty and propose strategies to reduce it. The poverty "

"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>National poverty estimates are derived from household survey data. "
"Caveats and limitations inherent to survey data applying to the "
"construction of indicator 1.1.1 apply here as well. </p>\n"
"<p>To be useful for poverty estimates, surveys must be nationally "
"representative. They must also include enough information to compute a "
"comprehensive estimate of total household consumption or income (including "
"consumption or income from own production) and to construct a correctly "
"weighted distribution of consumption or income per person.</p>\n"
"<p>Consumption is the preferred welfare indicator for a number of "
"reasons<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[2]</a></sup>. "
"Income is generally more difficult to measure accurately. For example, the "
"poor who work in the informal sector may not receive or report monetary "
"wages; self-employed workers often experience irregular income flows; and "
"many people in rural areas depend on idiosyncratic, agricultural incomes. "
"Moreover, consumption accords better with the idea of the standard of "
"living than income, which can vary over time even if the actual standard of "
"living does not. Thus, whenever possible, consumption-based welfare "
"indicators are used to estimate the poverty measures reported here. But "
"consumption data are not always available. For instance in Latin America "
"and the Caribbean, the vast majority of countries collect primarily income "
"data. In those cases there is little choice but to use income data.</p>\n"
"<p>Consumption is measured by using household survey questions on food and "
"nonfood expenditures as well as food consumed from the household&#x2019;s "
"own production, which is particularly important in the poorest developing "
"countries. This information is collected either through recall questions "
"using lists of consumption items or through diaries in which respondents "
"record all expenditures daily. But these methods do not always provide "
"equivalent information, and depending on the approach used, consumption can "
"be underestimated or overestimated. Different surveys use different recall "
"or reference periods. Depending on the true flow of expenditures, the rate "
"of spending reported is sensitive to the length of reporting period. The "
"longer the reference period, the more likely respondents will fail to "
"recall certain expenses&#x2014;especially food items&#x2014;thus resulting "
"in underestimation of true expenditure.</p>\n"
"<p>Best-practice surveys administer detailed lists of specific consumption "
"items. These individual items collected through the questionnaires are "
"aggregated afterwards. But many surveys use questionnaires in which "
"respondents are asked to report expenditures for broad categories of goods. "
"In other words, specific consumption items are implicitly aggregated by "
"virtue of the questionnaire design. This shortens the interview, reducing "
"the cost of the survey. A shorter questionnaire is also thought to reduce "
"the likelihood of fatigue for both respondents and interviewers, which can "
"lead to reporting errors. However, there is also evidence that less "
"detailed coverage of specific items in the questionnaire can lead to "
"underestimation of actual household consumption. The reuse of "
"questionnaires may cause new consumption goods to be omitted, leading to "
"further underreporting.</p>\n"
"<p>Invariably some sampled households do not participate in surveys because "
"they refuse to do so or because nobody is at home. This is often referred "
"to as &#x201C;unit nonresponse&#x201D; and is distinct from &#x201C;item "
"nonresponse,&#x201D; which occurs when some of the sampled respondents "
"participate but refuse to answer certain questions, such as those "
"pertaining to consumption or income. To the extent that survey nonresponse "
"is random, there is no concern regarding biases in survey-based inferences; "
"the sample will still be representative of the population. However, "
"households with different incomes are not equally likely to respond. "
"Relatively rich households may be less likely to participate because of the "
"high opportunity cost of their time or because of concerns about intrusion "
"in their affairs. It is conceivable that the poorest can likewise be "
"underrepresented; some are homeless and hard to reach in standard household "
"survey designs, and some may be physically or socially isolated and thus "
"less easily interviewed. If nonresponse systematically increases with "
"income, surveys will tend to overestimate poverty. But if compliance tends "
"to be lower for both the very poor and the very rich, there will be "
"potentially offsetting effects on the measured incidence of poverty.</p>\n"
"<p>Even if survey data were entirely accurate and comprehensive, the "
"measure of poverty obtained could still fail to capture important aspects "
"of individual welfare. For example, using household consumption measures "
"ignores potential inequalities within households. Thus, consumption- or "
"income-based poverty measures are informative but should not be interpreted "
"as a sufficient statistic for assessing the quality of people&#x2019;s "
"lives. The national poverty rate, a &#x201C;headcount&#x201D; measure, is "
"one of the most commonly calculated measures of poverty. Yet it has the "
"drawback that it does not capture income inequality among the poor or the "
"depth of poverty. For instance, it fails to account for the fact that some "
"people may be living just below the poverty line, while others experience "
"far greater shortfalls. Policymakers seeking to make the largest possible "
"impact on the headcount measure might be tempted to direct their poverty "
"alleviation resources to those closest to the poverty line (and therefore "
"least poor).</p>\n"
"<p>Issues may also arise when comparing poverty measures within countries "
"when urban and rural poverty lines represent different purchasing powers. "
"For example, the cost of living is typically higher in urban than in rural "
"areas. One reason is that food staples tend to be more expensive in urban "
"areas. So the urban monetary poverty line should be higher than the rural "
"poverty line. But it is not always clear that the difference between urban "
"and rural poverty lines found in practice reflects only differences in the "
"cost of living. In some countries the urban poverty line in common use has "
"a higher real value&#x2014;meaning that it allows the purchase of more "
"commodities for consumption&#x2014;than does the rural poverty line. "
"Sometimes the difference has been so large as to imply that the incidence "
"of poverty is greater in urban than in rural areas, even though the reverse "
"is found when adjustments are made only for differences in the cost of "
"living. As with international comparisons, when the real value of the "
"poverty line varies it is not clear how meaningful such urban-rural "
"comparisons are.</p>\n"
"<p>Lastly, these income/consumption based poverty indicators do not fully "
"reflect the other dimensions of poverty such as inequality, vulnerability, "
"and lack of voice and power of the poor.</p><div "
