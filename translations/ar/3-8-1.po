"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>The index of health service coverage is computed as the geometric means "

"are as follows, organized by four broad categories of service coverage:</p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>I. Reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health</em></"
"strong></p>\n"
"<p>1. <strong>Family planning</strong>: Percentage of women of reproductive "

"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>Many of the tracer indicators of health service coverage are measured by "
"household surveys. However, administrative data, facility data, facility "
"surveys, and sentinel surveillance systems are utilized for certain "
"indicators. Underlying data sources for each of the 14 tracer indicators are "
"explained in more detail in Annex 1.</p>\n"
"<p>In terms of values used to compute the index, values are taken from "
"existing published sources. This includes assembled data sets and estimates "

"<h2>Collection process:</h2>\n"
"<p>The mechanisms for collecting data from countries vary across the 14 "
"tracer indicators, however in many cases a UN agency or interagency group "
"has assembled and analysed relevant national data sources and then conducted "
"a formal country consultation with country governments to review or produce "
"comparable country estimates. For the UHC service coverage index, once this "
"existing information on the 14 tracer indicators is collated, WHO conducts a "
"country consultation with nominated focal points from national governments "
"to review inputs and the calculation of the index. WHO does not undertake "
"new estimation activities to produce tracer indicator values for the service "
"coverage index; rather, the index is designed to make use of existing and "
"well-established indicator data series to reduce reporting burden.</p>"

msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Target 3.8 is defined as &#x201C;Achieve universal health coverage, "
"including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care "
"services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential "
"medicines and vaccines for all&#x201D;. The concern is with all people and "
"communities receiving the quality health services they need (including "
"medicines and other health products), without financial hardship. Two "
"indicators have been chosen to monitor target 3.8 within the SDG framework. "
"Indicator 3.8.1 is for health service coverage and indicator 3.8.2 focuses "
"on health expenditures in relation to a household&#x2019;s budget to "
"identify financial hardship caused by direct health care payments. Taken "
"together, indicators 3.8.1 and 3.8.2 are meant to capture the service "
"coverage and financial protection dimensions, respectively, of target 3.8. "
"These two indicators should be always monitored jointly.</p>\n"
"<p>Countries provide many essential services for health protection, "
"promotion, prevention, treatment and care. Indicators of service coverage "
"&#x2013; defined as people receiving the service they need &#x2013; are the "
"best way to track progress in providing services under universal health "
"coverage (UHC). Since a single health service indicator does not suffice for "
"monitoring UHC, an index is constructed from 14 tracer indicators selected "
"based on epidemiological and statistical criteria. This includes several "
"indicators that are already included in other SDG targets, thereby "
"minimizing the data collection and reporting burden. The index is reported "
"on a unitless scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being the optimal value.</p>"

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>These tracer indicators are meant to be indicative of service coverage, "
"not a complete or exhaustive list of health services and interventions that "
"are required for universal health coverage. The 14 tracer indicators were "
"selected because they are well-established, with available data widely "
"reported by countries (or expected to become widely available soon). "
"Therefore, the index can be computed with existing data sources and does not "
"require initiating new data collection efforts solely to inform the index.</"

msgctxt "DATA_COMP"
msgid ""
"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<p><strong>Computation method:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>The index is computed with geometric means, based on the methods used for "
"the Human Development Index. The calculation of the 3.8.1 indicator requires "
"first preparing the 14 tracer indicators so that they can be combined into "
"the index, and then computing the index from those values. </p>\n"
"<p>The 14 tracer indicators are first all placed on the same scale, with 0 "
"being the lowest value and 100 being the optimal value. For most indicators, "
"this scale is the natural scale of measurement, e.g., the percentage of "
"infants who have been immunized ranges from 0 to 100 percent. However, for a "
"few indicators additional rescaling is required to obtain appropriate values "
"from 0 to 100, as follows:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>Rescaling based on a non-zero minimum to obtain finer resolution (this "
"&#x201C;stretches&#x201D; the distribution across countries): prevalence of "
"non-raised blood pressure and prevalence of non-use of tobacco are both "
"rescaled using a minimum value of 50%.<ul>\n"
"      <li>rescaled value = (X-50)/(100-50)*100</li>\n"
"    </ul>\n"
"  </li>\n"
"  <li>Rescaling for a continuous measure: mean fasting plasma glucose, which "
"is a continuous measure (units of mmol/L), is converted to a scale of 0 to "
"100 using the minimum theoretical biological risk (5.1 mmol/L) and observed "
"maximum across countries (7.1 mmol/L).<ul>\n"
"      <li>rescaled value = (7.1 - original value)/(7.1-5.1)*100</li>\n"
"    </ul>\n"
"  </li>\n"
"  <li>Maximum thresholds for rate indicators: hospital bed density and "
"health workforce density are both capped at maximum thresholds, and values "
"above this threshold are held constant at 100. These thresholds are based on "
"minimum values observed across OECD countries.<ul>\n"
"      <li>rescaled hospital beds per 10,000 = minimum(100, original value / "
"18*100)</li>\n"
"      <li>rescaled physicians per 1,000 = minimum(100, original value / "
"0.9*100)</li>\n"
"      <li>rescaled psychiatrists per 100,000 = minimum(100, original value / "
"1*100)</li>\n"
"      <li>rescaled surgeons per 100,000 = minimum(100, original value / "
"14*100)</li>\n"
"    </ul>\n"
"  </li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>Once all tracer indicator values are on a scale of 0 to 100, geometric "
"means are computed within each of the four health service areas, and then a "
"geometric mean is taken of those four values. If the value of a tracer "
"indicator happens to be zero, it is set to 1 (out of 100) before computing "
"the geometric mean. The following diagram illustrates the calculations.</p>\n"

"<h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>The starting point for computing the index is to assemble existing "
"information for each tracer indicator. In many cases, this involves using "
"country time series that have been produced or collated by UN agencies in "
"consultation with country governments (e.g., immunization coverage, access "
"to sanitation, HIV treatment coverage, etc). Some of these published time "
"series involve mathematical modelling to reconcile multiple data sources or "
"impute missing values, and these details are summarized in Annex 1. </p>\n"
"<p>After assembling these inputs, there are still missing values for some "
"country-years for some indicators. Calculating the UHC service coverage "
"index requires values for each tracer indicator for a country, so some "
"imputation is necessary to fill these data gaps. The current approach "
"involves a simple imputation algorithm. For each indicator:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>\n"
"    <ul>\n"
"      <li>If a country has missing values between two years with values, "
"linear interpolation is used to fill missing values for the intervening "
"years</li>\n"
"      <li>If a country has historical years with values, but no current "
"value, constant extrapolation is used to fill missing values to the current "
"year</li>\n"
"      <li>If a country has no values, a value is imputed. For pneumonia care-"
"seeking and density of surgeons, a regression is fit to impute missing "
"values (see Annex 1 for details). For all other indicators, a regional "
"median is calculated to impute missing values. Regions are based on World "
"Bank geographic regions, with a separate grouping of traditional high-income "
"countries<sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-ref-1\">[1]</a></sup> </"
"li>\n"
"    </ul>\n"
"  </li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>Given the timing and distribution of various health surveys and other "
"data collection mechanisms, countries do not collect and report on all 14 "
"tracer indicators of health service coverage on an annual basis. In "
"addition, monitoring at country level is most suitably done at broader time "
"intervals, e.g., every 5 years, to allow for new data collection across "
"indicators. Therefore, the extent to which imputation has been used to fill "
"missing information should be communicated along with the index value. </p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li><strong><em>At regional and global levels:</em></strong></li>\n"

"<h1>Data availability</h1>\n"
"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>Summarizing data availability for the UHC service coverage index is not "
"straightforward, as different data sources are used across the 14 tracer "
"indicators. Additionally, for many indicators comparable estimates have been "
"produced, in many cases drawing on different types of underlying data "
"sources to inform the estimates while also using projections to impute "
"missing values. Based on the underlying data sources for each of the tracer "
"indicators (i.e., ignoring estimates and projections), the average "
"proportion of indicators used to compute the index with underlying data "
"available since 2010 is around 70% across countries globally.</p>\n"
"<h2>Time series:</h2>\n"
"<p>A baseline value for the UHC service coverage index for 2015 across 183 "
"countries was published in late 2017. As part of this process, data sources "
"going back to 2000 were assembled. In 2019, it is anticipated to publish a "
"time series from 2000 to 2017.</p>\n"
"<h2>Disaggregation:</h2>\n"
"<p>Equity is central to the definition of UHC, and therefore the UHC service "
"coverage index should be used to communicate information about inequalities "
"in service coverage within countries. This can be done by presenting the "
"index separately for the national population vs disadvantaged populations to "
"highlight differences between them. </p>\n"
"<p>For countries, geographic location is likely the most feasible dimension "
"for sub-national disaggregation based on average coverage levels measured "
"with existing data sources. To do this, the UHC index can be computed "
"separately by, e.g., province or urban vs rural residence, which would allow "
"for subnational comparisons of service coverage. Currently, the most readily "
"available data for disaggregation on other dimensions of inequality, such as "
"household wealth, is for indicators of coverage within the reproductive, "
"maternal, newborn and child health services category. Inequality observed in "
"this dimension can be used as a proxy to understand differences in service "
"coverage across key inequality dimensions. This approach should be replaced "
"with full disaggregation of all 14 tracer indicators once data are available "
"to do so.</p>"

"<h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>\n"

"directly from country reported data. </p>"

"        <p>Using available data, the indicator is computed by first "
"rescaling, separately, health worker density ratios for each of the three "
"cadres (physicians, psychiatrists and surgeons) relative to the minimum "
"observed values across OECD countries since 2000, which are as follows: "
"physicians = 0.9 per 1000, psychiatrists = 1 per 100,000, and surgeons = 14 "
"per 100,000. This rescaling is done in the same way as that for the hospital "
"bed density indicator described above, resulting in indicator values that "
"range from 0 to 100 for each of the three cadres. For example, using country "
"data on physicians per 1000 population (<em>x</em>), the cadre-specific "
"indicator would be computed as:</p>\n"
"        <p>Country with <em>x</em> &lt; 0.9 per 1000 per year, the cadre-"
"specific indicator = <em>x</em> /0.9*100. </p>\n"
"        <p>Country with <em>x</em> &gt;= 0.9 per 1000 per year, the cadre-"
"specific indicator = 100.</p>\n"
"        <p>As a final step, the geometric mean of the three cadre-specific "
"indicator values is computed to obtain the final indicator of health "
"workforce density.</p>\n"
