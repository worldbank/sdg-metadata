"<p>This indicator expresses the value added of sustainable marine capture "
"fisheries as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). </p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>The <u>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</u> is the value of all final goods "
"and services produced in an economy in a given period, which is equivalent "
"to the sum of the value added (VA) from all sectors in an economy.</p>\n"
"<p>The <u>value added of marine capture fisheries</u> measures the value of "
"fish harvested from marine stocks, minus the value of goods and services "
"that are used in the production process (such as raw materials and "
"utilities). It includes activities that are normally integrated into the "
"process of production and occur at sea, such as fishing vessels which "
"process or preserve their catch on board. However, it does not include the "
"processing or preserving of fish when it occurs in land based facilities.</"
"p>\n"
"<p>A <u>fish stock</u> is a subset of a species (fish, crustacean, mollusc, "
"etc.) or a population inhabiting a geographical area and participating in "
"the same reproductive process.</p>\n"
"<p><u>Maximum sustainable yield (MSY)</u> is the highest theoretical "
"equilibrium yield that can be continuously taken (on average) from a stock "
"under existing (average) environmental conditions without significantly "
"affecting the reproduction process. A stock fished at <u>(MSY)</u> is "
"referred to as <u>biologically sustainable</u>, as it may remain stable or "
"grow while sustaining losses from fishing and natural sources of mortality.</"
"p>\n"
"<p><u>FAO Fishing Areas for Statistical Purposes</u> are arbitrary areas to "
"facilitate comparison of data, improving the possibilities of cooperation in "
"statistical matters.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-ref-1\">[1]</"
"a></sup></p>\n"
"<p>The basic concepts associated with this indicator are part of the "
"following international instruments and classification schemes:</p>\n"
"<p><u>The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea "
"(UNCLOS)<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[2]</a></sup></"
"u></p>\n"
"<p><em>This instrument is the basis upon which all the subsequent "
"instruments are built. UNCLOS defines the rights and responsibilities of "
"nations concerning their use of the world&apos;s oceans, establishing "
"guidelines for businesses, the environment, and the management of marine "
"natural resources. It is a binding instrument, although its principles may "
"also be applied by countries who are not a party to it.</em></p>\n"
"<p><u>The 1995 FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF)<sup><a "
"href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[3]</a></sup></u></p>\n"
"<p><em>This instrument provides the necessary framework for national and "
"international efforts to ensure sustainable exploitation of aquatic living "
"resources in harmony with the environment by establishing principles and "
"standards applicable to the conservation, management, and development of all "
"fisheries.</em></p>\n"
"<p><em>The FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries relies on the "
"concept of MSY when setting general principles and standards for fisheries "
"management.  Article 7.2.1 details how management measures should be &#x201C;"
"based on the best scientific evidence available&#x201D; and &#x201C;designed "
"to maintain or restore stocks at levels capable of producing maximum "
"sustainable yield, as qualified by relevant environmental and economic "

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Although target 14.7 promotes the sustainable use of marine resources "
"&#x201C;including of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism&#x201D;, this "
"indicator as selected by the IAEG-SDG focuses only on the sustainable use of "
"marine resources by fisheries. The methodology hereby proposed by FAO thus "
"measures sustainable fisheries as a percentage of GDP, in accordance to the "
"agreed indicator formulation.</p>\n"
"<p>The share of value added from an industry in GDP is commonly used as an "
"indication of its economic importance. Accordingly, the value added of "
"marine capture fisheries indicates the prominence of marine fish related "
"activities in the country&#x2019;s economy and its importance for "
"livelihoods. Both GDP and the VA are measured in constant prices and "
"domestic currency.</p>\n"
"<p>Stocks that are fished at sustainable levels are able to support the "
"communities and industries which rely on them, without compromising "
"reproduction and long-term sustainability. By contrast, a stock that is "
"exploited to a point where it cannot replenish itself will ultimately "
"provide sub-optimal long-term economic returns for stakeholders. </p>\n"
"<p>The status of a fish stock is evaluated through a various processes of "
"assessment that commonly combines biological and statistical information to "
"assess changes in its abundance in response to fishing, which also enables "
"forecasting of future trends. </p>\n"
"<p>FAO has been periodically analysing and compiling the status of marine "
"fish stocks combining the results of formal stock assessments available, "
"including the assessments carried out at the regional level and a finer "
"scale by national institutions and scientific working groups. For stocks "
"that do not have a formal stock assessment, effort is made to collect "
"relevant data and information from the literature, or from local experts, "
"that could be used to infer stock status (for instance trends in catch "
"rates, size frequency distribution of the catch, occasional fishing "
"mortality estimates through surveys, etc.). The information from various "
"sources is analysed and synthesized to classify the exploitation status of "
"fish stocks. FAO monitoring of stocks will be enhanced with the "
"implementation of SDG indicator 14.4.1, which tracks progress towards more "
"fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels at national, regional "
"(across FAO Major Fishing Areas) and global levels.</p>\n"
"<p>Based on FAO&#x2019;s monitoring of stocks at regional and global level, "
"the percentage of fish resources that are within biologically sustainable "
"levels has exhibited a downward trend from 90 percent in 1974 to 67 percent "
"in 2015, while 33 percent are considered to be overexploited. "
"Overexploitation not only has negative ecological consequences, but also "
"reduces long-term fishery yields, which have adverse social and economic "
"effects, particularly for dependent communities in developing countries and "
"Small Island Developing States (SIDS).</p>"

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator measures the value added of sustainable marine capture "
"fisheries as a proportion of GDP. However, the vast majority of countries "
"report only aggregated data for value added for the fisheries and "
"aquaculture sector. To overcome this problem it is necessary to separate the "
"value added for marine capture fisheries from the aggregated data. "
"Preferably this would be done using the value of marine capture fisheries as "
"a proxy. However, in the absence of value data, the quantity of marine "
"capture fisheries as a proportion of total production is used as a proxy for "
"the proportion of value added.</p>\n"
"<p>For marine capture fisheries, despite the expanded coverage of FAO&#x2019;"
"s assessments in recent years, data deficiencies may lead to uncertainty as "
"to the level of exploitation of a stock. While data limitations exist, the "
"methodology employed by FAO seeks to eliminate discrepancies and provide a "
"representative assessment of marine fish stocks. The time series for which "
"stock assessment is available starts with the first public release of FAO "
"stock assessment, in 2011 for each FAO Major Fishing area. FAO continues to "
"release this information biennially.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-8\" id="
"\"footnote-ref-8\">[8]</a></sup></p>\n"
"<p>National fish stock assessments are only available for a few countries, "
"and therefore are not globally or regionally representative. Therefore, the "
"sustainability multiplier used in the compilation of this indicator is based "
"on the average fish stock sustainability calculated by FAO for each Major "
"Fishing Area. For each country, the sustainability multiplier will be the "
"average sustainability weighted by the proportion of the quantity of marine "
"capture for each respective fishing area in which the country performs "
"fishing activities. </p>\n"
"<p>Currently, FAO aims to begin compiling country-level estimates for SDG "
"indicator 14.4.1 (proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable "
"levels) in 2020. Once these estimates become available, the computation "
"method for the current indicator will use country-level estimates rather "
"than estimates based on FAO Major Fishing Areas to determine the "
"sustainability multiplier and hence estimate the value added of sustainable "
"marine capture fisheries as a proportion of GDP.</p><div class=\"footnotes"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<p>At a country level, the contribution of sustainable marine capture "
"fisheries to the GDP is calculated as follows:</p>\n"
"<p>a) The percentage contribution of fisheries and aquaculture to GDP is "
"estimated by simply dividing the value added of fisheries and aquaculture by "
"national GDP.</p>\n"
"<p><em>GDP from Fisheries and Aquaculture (%) = Value Added Fisheries and "
"Aquaculture/GDP</em></p>\n"
"<p><em>GDP<sub>FIA</sub> = VA<sub>FIA</sub>/GDP</em></p>\n"
"<p>b) In order to disaggregate for the value added of marine capture "
"fisheries and the value added of aquaculture, the quantity of fish produced "
"from marine capture fisheries will be divided by total quantity of national "
"production of fish, and then multiplied by the percentage of GDP from "
"fisheries and aquaculture. As such, the quantity of production of marine "
"capture fisheries is used as a proxy for the value of marine capture "
"fisheries.</p>\n"
"<p><em>Value added of Marine Capture Fisheries proxy (%) = </em></p>\n"
"<p><em>GDP from Fisheries and Aquaculture x (Quantity of Marine Capture "
"Fisheries/Total Quantity of Fish)</em></p>\n"
"<p><em>VA<sub>F </sub>= GDP<sub>FIA</sub> x (Q<sub>M</sub>/Q<sub>T</sub>)</"
"em></p>\n"
"<p>c) The sustainability multiplier will be calculated based on the average "
"sustainability published periodically for each FAO major marine fishing "
"area. </p>\n"
"<p>For each country, the sustainability multiplier will be the average "
"sustainability weighted by the proportion of the quantity of marine capture "
"for each respective fishing area in which the country performs fishing "
"activities. When a country fishes in only one FAO fishing area, its "
"sustainability multiplier will be equal to the average sustainability of "
"stocks in that area. </p>\n"
"<p>Sustainability multiplier = Sum of (Sustainability for Each region x "
"((Quantity fished from Each marine region/Total Quantity fished from All "
"marine regions))</p>\n"
