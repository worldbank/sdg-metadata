"<p>Mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or "

"70 years from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic "
"respiratory diseases, defined as the per cent of 30-year-old-people who "
"would die before their 70th birthday from cardiovascular disease, cancer, "
"diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease, assuming that s/he would "
"experience current mortality rates at every age and s/he would not die from "
"any other cause of death (e.g., injuries or HIV/AIDS). This indicator is "
"calculated using life table methods (see further details in section 3.3).</"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Disease burden from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among adults is "
"rapidly increasing in developing countries due to ageing. Cardiovascular "
"diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases are the four "
"main causes of NCD burden. Measuring the risk of dying from these four major "
"causes is important to assess the extent of burden from premature mortality "
"due NCDs in a population.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>Cause of death estimates have large uncertainty ranges for some causes "
"and some regions. Data gaps and limitations in high-mortality regions "
"reinforce the need for caution when interpreting global comparative cause of "
"death assessments, as well as the need for increased investment in "
"population health measurement systems. The use of verbal autopsy methods in "
"sample registration systems, demographic surveillance systems and household "
"surveys provides some information on causes of death in populations without "
"well-functioning death registration systems, but there remain considerable "
"challenges in the validation and interpretation of such data, and in the "
"assessment of uncertainty associated with diagnoses of underlying cause of "
"death.</p>"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>There are 4 steps involved in the calculation of this indicator:</p>\n"
"<p>1. Estimation of WHO life tables, based on the UN World Population "
"Prospects 2012 revision. </p>\n"
"<p>2. Estimation of cause-of-death distributions. </p>\n"
"<p>3. Calculation of age-specific mortality rates from the four main NCDs "
"for each five-year age range between 30 and 70. </p>\n"
"<p>4. Calculation of the probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 "
"years from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory "
"diseases.</p>\n"
"<p>The methods used for the analysis of causes of death depend on the type "
"of data available from countries:</p>\n"
"<p>For countries with a high-quality vital registration system including "
"information on cause of death, the vital registration that member states "
"submit to the WHO Mortality Database were used, with adjustments where "
"necessary, e.g. for under-reporting of deaths.</p>\n"
"<p>For countries without high-quality death registration data, cause of "
"death estimates are calculated using other data, including household surveys "
"with verbal autopsy, sample or sentinel registration systems, special "
"studies and surveillance systems. In most cases, these data sources are "
"combined in a modelling framework.</p>\n"
"<p>The probability of dying between ages 30 and 70 years from the four main "
"NCDs was estimated using age-specific death rates of the combined four main "
"NCD categories. Using the life table method, the risk of death between the "
"exact ages of 30 and 70, from any of the four causes and in the absence of "
"other causes of death, was calculated using the equation below. The ICD "
"codes used are: Cardiovascular disease: I00-I99, Cancer: C00-C97, Diabetes: "
"E10-E14, and Chronic respiratory disease: J30-J98 </p>\n"
"<p>Formulas to (1) calculate age-specific mortality rate for each five-year "
"age group between 30 and 70, (2) translate the 5-year death rate into the "
"probability of death in each 5-year age range, and (3) calculate the "
"probability of death from age 30 to age 70, independent of other causes of "
"death, can be found on page 6 of this document:</p>\n"
