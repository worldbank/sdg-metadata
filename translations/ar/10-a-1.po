"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>Proportion of total number of tariff lines (in per cent) applied to "
"products imported from least developed countries and developing countries "
"corresponding to a 0% tariff rate in HS chapter 01-97.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Tariff line or National Tariff lines (NTL):</em></strong> "
"National Tariff Line codes refer to the classification codes, applied to "
"merchandise goods by individual countries, that are longer than the HS six "
"digit level. Countries are free to introduce national distinctions for "
"tariffs and many other purposes. The national tariff line codes are based on "
"the HS system but are longer than six digits. For example, the six digit HS "
"code 010120 refers to Asses, mules and hinnies, live, whereas the US "
"National Tariff line code 010120.10 refers to live purebred breeding asses, "
"010120.20 refers to live asses other than purebred breeding asses and "
"010120.30 refers to mules and hinnies imported for immediate slaughter.</p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Tariffs:</em></strong> Tariffs are customs duties on "
"merchandise imports, levied either on an ad valorem basis (percentage of "
"value) or on a specific basis (e.g. $7 per 100 kg). Tariffs can be used to "
"create a price advantage for similar locally-produced goods and for raising "
"government revenues. Trade remedy measures and taxes are not considered to "
"be tariffs.</p>"

"<h1>Data sources</h1>\n"
"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>The main information used to calculate indicators 10.a.1 is import tariff "
"data. Information on import tariffs might be retrieved by contacting "
"directly National statistical offices, permanent country missions to the UN, "
"regional organizations or focal points within the customs, ministries in "
"charge of customs revenues (Ministry of economy/finance and related revenue "
"authorities) or, alternatively, the Ministry of trade. Tariff data for the "
"calculation of this indicator are retrieved from ITC (MAcMap) - <a href="
"\"http://www.macmap.org/%20\">http://www.macmap.org/</a> - WTO (IDB) - <a "
"href=\"http://tao.wto.org\">http://tao.wto.org</a> - and UNCTAD (TRAINS) "
"databases. Import tariff data included in the ITC (MAcMap) database are "
"collected by contacting directly focal points in line national agencies or "
"regional organizations (in the case of custom unions or regional economic "
"communities). When available, data are downloaded from national or regional "
"official websites. In some cases, data are purchased from private companies. "
"Import tariff data included in the WTO (IDB) database are sourced from "
"official notifications of WTO members. Import tariff included in the UNCTAD "

"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The calculation of this indicator will allow observing on how many "
"products Developing countries and LDCs will have free access to Developed "
"countries markets. When compared to the tariff rates applied to other "
"countries, this indicator will allow assessing to which extent special and "
"differential treatment has been accorded in terms of import tariffs. The "
"evolution of this indicator will indicate progress on the phasing out of "
"tariff rates on goods coming from Developing and LDCs.</p>"

"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>The following caveats should be taken in consideration while reviewing "
"this indicator:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>Accurate estimates on special and differential treatment for "
"developing countries do not exist, thus the calculations are limited to "
"tariffs only. These are only part of the trade limitation factors, "
"especially when looking at exports of developing or least developed "
"countries under non-reciprocal preferential treatment that set criteria for "
"eligibility.</li>\n"
"  <li>A full coverage of preferential schemes of developed countries are "
"used for the computation, but preferential treatment may not be fully used "
"by developing countries&apos; exporters for different reasons such as the "
"inability of certain exporters to meet eligibility criteria (i.e., complying "
"with rules of origin). As there is no accurate statistical information on "
"the extent of the actual utilisation of each of these preferences, it is "
"assumed that they are fully utilised.</li>\n"
"  <li>Duty free treatment is an indicator of market access, but is not "
"always synonymous with preferential treatment for beneficiary countries, "
"because a number of MFN tariffs are already at, or close to, zero, "
"especially for fuels and minerals. International agreements on IT products "
"also offer duty-free treatment for components and equipment used for "
"production purpose.</li>\n"
