"<p>The methodology involved collecting data from a number of different "
"sectors and stakeholders in each country is as follows. National Data "
"Coordinators (NDCs), who were nominated by their governments, were trained "
"in the project methodology. As representatives of their ministries, they "
"were required to identify up to eight other road safety experts within their "
"country from different sectors (e.g. health, police, transport, "
"nongovernmental organizations and/or academia) and to facilitate a consensus "
"meeting of these respondents. While each expert responded to the "
"questionnaire based on their expertise, the consensus meeting facilitated by "
"NDCs allowed for discussion of all responses, and the group used this "
"discussion to agree on one final set of information that best represented "
"their country&#x2019;s situation at the time (up to 2014, using the most "
"recent data available). This was then submitted to the World Health "
"Organization (WHO). More details are in the Global Status Report on Road "
"Safety 2015. A guide to our questionnaire describing age groups and other "
"dimensions was provided to countries in order to standardize data collected."

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>Our model is based on the quality of data we received. As a health "
"organization, we rely primarily on the submission of vital registration data "
"from countries&#x2019; Ministries of Health to WHO (through the official "
"channels). These data, on all causes of death, are then analysed by our "
"colleagues in the Health Information Systems department to decide on how "
"good the data are, that is, determining if there is good completeness and "
"coverage of deaths for all causes. </p>\n"
"<p>We classified the countries on 4 categories or groups namely,</p>\n"
"<p>Group 1: Countries with death registration data (good vital/ death "
"registration data)</p>\n"
"<p>Group 2: Countries with other sources of information on causes of death</"
"p>\n"
"<p>Group 3: Countries with population less than 150 000</p>\n"
"<p>Group 4: Countries without eligible death registration data.</p>\n"
"<p>The Health Information Systems department analyses the quality and the "
"completeness of the data. For the road safety model, if the country is "
"considered by WHO to have good vital registration (VR) data this means that "
"the country is in group 1, then we don&#x2019;t apply a regression model to "
"come up with an estimate (we may, however, project forward if the vital "
"registration data are dated). If the country is considered in group 4 then "
"we apply a negative binomial regression where N is the total road traffic "
"deaths , C is constant term, Xi are a set of explanatory covariates, Pop is "
"the population for the country-year, and ? is the negative binomial error "
"term.</p>\n"
"<p>For the countries from group 2, the regression method described above was "
"used to project forward the most recent year for which an estimate of total "
"deaths were available.</p>\n"
"<p>Finally, the countries from group 3 which have a population less than "
"150,000 and did not have eligible death registration data, regression "
"estimates were not used. Only the reported death were directly without "
"adjustment.</p>\n"

"<p>1) Identified missing values (or years) in vital registration (VR) data "

"the latest 3 years where VR and Reported data were available and used this "
"factor to adjust Reported data to replace the missing value of VR data.</p>\n"
"<p>2) In the case where there is missing data in VR and Reported data, the "
"missing values were imputed with a negative binomial regression of rate for "
"each country if the regression converged or was significant. Otherwise we "
