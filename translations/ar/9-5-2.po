"<p>The researchers (in full-time equivalent) per million inhabitants is a "
"direct measure of the number of research and development workers per 1 "

"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>The OECD Frascati Manual (OECD, 2015) provides the relevant definitions "
"for research and experimental development, gross domestic expenditure on "
"R&amp;D and researchers. Although an OECD manual, the application is global. "
"During the 6th revision of the Frascati Manual, developing country issues "
"were mainstreamed in the core of the Manual. The 7th edition was released in "
"October 2015.</p>\n"
"<p>The following definitions, taken from the 2015 edition of the Frascati "
"Manual are relevant for computing the indicator. </p>\n"
"<p>Research and experimental development (R&amp;D) comprise creative and "
"systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge "
"&#x2013; including knowledge of humankind, culture and society &#x2013; and "
"to devise new applications of available knowledge.</p>\n"
"<p>Researchers are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of "
"new knowledge. They conduct research and improve or develop concepts, "
"theories, models, techniques instrumentation, software or operational "
"methods.</p>\n"
"<p>The Full-time equivalent (FTE) of R&amp;D personnel is defined as the "
"ratio of working hours actually spent on R&amp;D during a specific reference "
"period (usually a calendar year) divided by the total number of hours "
"conventionally worked in the same period by an individual or by a group.</p>"
