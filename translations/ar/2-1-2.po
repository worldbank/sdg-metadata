"<p><strong>Obtaining internationally comparable data for global monitoring:</"

"<p>To ensure comparability of the FImod+sev and FIsev indicators computed "
"for different populations, universal thresholds are defined on the FIES "
"global reference scale and converted into corresponding values on the "
"&#x201C;local&#x201D; scales obtained as a result of application of the "
"Rasch model on any specific population, through a process of &#x201C;"
"equating&#x201D;.</p>\n"
"<p>Equating is a form of standardization of the metric based on "
"identification of the subset of items that can be considered common to the "
"global FIES and the specific scale used for measurement in each context. The "
"severity levels associated with the common items are used as anchoring "
"points to adjust the global FIES thresholds to the local scales. The "
"standardization process ensures that the mean and standard deviation of the "
"set of common items is the same when measured on the global FIES or on the "
"national scale. Compatibility with the global FIES and the possibility to "
"compile this indicator requires that at least four of the eight FIES items "
"are identified as common.</p>\n"
"<p>The Statistics Division at FAO has developed the RM.weights package under "
"R, which provides routines for estimating the parameters of the Rasch model "
"using conditional maximum likelihood, with the possibility to allow for the "
"complex survey design.</p>"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Food insecurity at moderate levels of severity is typically associated "
"with the inability to regularly eat healthy, balanced diets. As such, high "
"prevalence of food insecurity at moderate levels can be considered a "
"predictor of various forms of diet-related health conditions in the "
"population, associated with micronutrient deficiency and unbalanced diets. "
"Severe levels of food insecurity, on the other hand, imply a high "
"probability of reduced food intake and therefore can lead to more severe "
"forms of undernutrition, including hunger.</p>\n"
"<p>Short questionnaires like the FIES are very easy to administer at limited "
"cost, which is one of the main advantages of their use. The ability to "
"precisely determine the food insecurity status of specific individuals or "
"households, however, is limited by the small number of questions, a reason "
"why assignment of individual respondents to food insecurity classes is best "
"done in probability terms, thus ensuring that estimates of prevalence rates "
"in a population are sufficiently reliable even when based on relatively "
"small sample sizes. </p>\n"
"<p>As with any statistical assessment, reliability and precision crucially "
"depend on the quality of the survey design and implementation. One major "
"advantage of the analytic treatment of the data through the Rasch model "
"based methods is that it permits testing the quality of the data collected "
"and evaluating the likely margin of uncertainty around estimated prevalence "
"rates, which should always be reported.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>An average of less than three minutes of survey time is estimated to "
"collect FIES data in a well-conducted face-to-face survey, which should make "
"it possible to include the FIES-SM in a nationally representative survey in "
"every country in the world, at a very reasonable cost. FAO provides versions "
"of the FIES-SM adapted and translated in each of the more than 200 languages "
"and dialects used in the Gallup World Poll.</p>\n"
"<p>When used in the Gallup World Poll, with sample sizes of only about 1000 "
"individuals, the width of confidence intervals rarely exceeds 20% of the "
"measured prevalence (that is, prevalence rates of around 50% are estimated "
"with margins of errors of plus or minus 5%). Obviously, confidence intervals "
"are likely to be much smaller when national prevalence rates are estimated "
"using larger samples.</p>\n"
"<p>Compared to other proposed non-official indicators of household food "
"insecurity, the FIES based approach has the advantage that food insecurity "
"prevalence rates are directly comparable across population groups and "
"countries. Even if they use similar labels (such as &#x201C;mild&#x201D;, "
"&#x201C;moderate&#x201D; and &#x201C;severe&#x201D; food insecurity) other "
"approaches have yet to demonstrate the formal comparability of the "
"thresholds used for classification, due to lack of the definition of a "
"proper statistical model that links the values of the &#x201C;"
"indexes&#x201D; or &#x201C;scores&#x201D; used for classification, to the "
"severity of food insecurity. For this reason, care should be taken when "
"comparing the results obtained with the FIES with those obtained with these "
"other indicators, even if, unfortunately, similar labels are used to "
"describe them.</p>"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>Data at the individual or household level is collected by applying an "
"experience-based food security scale questionnaire within a survey. The food "
"security survey module collects answers to questions asking respondents to "
"report the occurrence of several typical experiences and conditions "
"associated with food insecurity. The data is analysed using the Rasch model "
"(also known as one-parameter logistic model, 1-PL), which postulates that "
"the probability of observing an affirmative answer by respondent i to "
"question j, is a logistic function of the distance, on an underlying scale "
"of severity, between the position of the respondent, <em>a<sub>,</sub></"

"<p>The FIES considers the three classes of (a) food security or mild food "

"<p>Given a representative sample, the prevalence of food insecurity at "

"<p>where <em>w<sub>i</sub></em><sub> </sub>are post-stratification weights "
"that indicate the proportion of individual or households in the national "
"population represented by each element in the sample.</p>\n"
"<p>It is important to note that if <em>w<sub>i</sub></em><sub> </sub>are "
"individual sampling weights, then the prevalence of food insecurity refers "
"to the total population of individuals, while if they are household weights, "
"the prevalence refers to the population of households. For the calculation "
"of the indicator 2.1.2, objective is to produce a prevalence of individuals. "
"This implies that: if a survey is at household level, and provides household "
"sampling weights, they should be transformed to individual sampling weights "
"by multiplying the weights by the household size. This individual weighting "
"system can then be used to calculate the individual prevalence rates in "
"formulas (1) and (2)</p>\n"
"<p>If the survey includes only adults, then the adult weights applied to the "
"probabilities in formulas (1) and (2) provide the adult prevalence rates "
"(<em>FI <sup>Adults</sup></em>). In this case, to calculate the prevalence "
"in the total population, then the proportion of children who live in "
"households where at least one adult is food insecure must also be "
"calculated. This can be done by dividing the adult weights by the number of "
"adults in the household and multiplying those approximate household weights "
"by the number of children in the household. Once the approximate child "
"weights are obtained, the prevalence of food insecurity of children who live "
"in households where at least one adult is food insecure (<em>FI "
"<sup>Children</sup></em>) can be calculated by applying these weights to the "
"probabilities of food insecurity in formulas (1) and (2). The prevalence of "
"food insecurity in the total population is finally calculated as:</p>\n"
