"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>Proportion of population covered by a mobile network, broken down by "
"technology, refers to the percentage of inhabitants living within range of a "
"mobile-cellular signal, irrespective of whether or not they are mobile phone "
"subscribers or users. This is calculated by dividing the number of "
"inhabitants within range of a mobile-cellular signal by the total population "
"and multiplying by 100.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator is based on where the population lives, and not where they "
"work or go to school, etc. When there are multiple operators offering the "
"service, the maximum population number covered should be reported. Coverage "
"should refer to LTE, broadband (3G) and narrowband (2G) mobile-cellular "
"technologies and include:</p>\n"
"<p><strong>2G mobile population coverage</strong>: Mobile networks with "
"access to data communications (e.g. Internet) at downstream speeds below 256 "
"Kbit/s. This includes mobile-cellular technologies such as GPRS, CDMA2000 1x "
"and most EDGE implementations. The indicator refers to the theoretical "
"ability of subscribers to use non-broadband speed mobile data services, "
"rather than the number of active users of such services.</p>\n"
"<p><strong>3G population coverage</strong>: refers to the percentage of "
"inhabitants that are within range of at least a 3G mobile-cellular signal, "
"irrespective of whether or not they are subscribers. This is calculated by "
"dividing the number of inhabitants that are covered by at least a 3G mobile-"
"cellular signal by the total population and multiplying by 100. It excludes "
"people covered only by GPRS, EDGE or CDMA 1xRTT.</p>\n"
"<p><strong>LTE population coverage</strong>: Refers to the percentage of "
"inhabitants that live within range of LTE/LTE-Advanced, mobile WiMAX/"
"WirelessMAN or other more advanced mobile-cellular networks, irrespective of "
"whether or not they are subscribers. This is calculated by dividing the "
"number of inhabitants that are covered by the previously mentioned mobile-"
"cellular technologies by the total population and multiplying by 100. It "
"excludes people covered only by HSPA, UMTS, EV-DO and previous 3G "
"technologies, and also excludes fixed WiMAX coverage.</p>\n"
"<p>As technologies evolve and as more and more countries will deploy and "
"commercialize more advanced mobile-broadband networks (5G etc.), the "
"indicator will include further breakdowns.</p>"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The percentage of the population covered by a mobile cellular network can "
"be considered as a minimum indicator for ICT access since it provides people "
"with the possibility to subscribe to and use mobile-cellular services to "
"communicate. Over the last decade, mobile-cellular networks have expanded "
"rapidly and helped overcome very basic infrastructure barriers that existed "
"when fixed-telephone networks &#x2013; often limited to urban and highly "
"populated areas - were the dominant telecommunication infrastructure.</p>\n"
"<p>While 2G (narrowband) mobile-cellular networks offer limited (and mainly "
"voice-based) services, higher-speed networks (3G and LTE) provide "
"increasingly high-speed, reliable and high-quality access to the Internet "
"and its increasing amount of information, content, services, and "
"applications. Mobile networks are therefore essential to overcoming "
"infrastructure barriers, helping people join the information society and "
"benefit from the potential of ICTs, in particular in least developed "
"countries.</p>\n"
"<p>The indicator highlights the importance of mobile networks in providing "
"basic, as well as advanced communication services and will help design "
"targeted policies to overcome remaining infrastructure barriers, and address "
"the digital divide. Many governments track this indicator and have set "
"specific targets in terms of the mobile population coverage (by technology) "
"that operators must achieve.</p>"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator percentage of the population covered by a mobile network, "
"broken down by technology, refers to the percentage of inhabitants living "
"within range of a mobile-cellular signal, irrespective of whether or not "
"they are mobile phone subscribers or users. This is calculated by dividing "
"the number of inhabitants within range of a mobile-cellular signal by the "
"total population and multiplying by 100.</p>"

"dominant mobile operator. Once all the country-level percentages are "
"available, the number of people covered by the mobile signal is calculated "
"by multiplying the percentage of population covered by the signal to the "
"population of the country. The regional and world total population covered "
"by a signal were calculated by summing the country-level data. The aggregate "
"percentages were calculated by dividing the regional totals by the "
"population of respective groups.</p>"

"countries and data on LTE mobile population coverage were available for 124 "

"<h2>Disaggregation:</h2>\n"
"<p>Based on the data for the percentage of the population covered by a "
"mobile network, broken down by technology, and on rural population figures, "
