"<p><strong><em>OECD</em></strong>: The flows covered by the OECD are defined "
"as all official loans, grants and equity investments received by countries "
"on the DAC List of ODA Recipients from foreign governments and multilateral "
"agencies, for the purpose of clean energy research and development and "
"renewable energy production, including in hybrid systems extracted from the "
"OECD/DAC Creditor Reporting System (CRS) with the following sector codes:</"
"p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>23210 Energy generation, renewable sources &#x2013; multiple "
"technologies - Renewable energy generation programmes that cannot be "
"attributed to one single technology (codes 23220 through 23280 below). "
"Fuelwood/charcoal production should be included under forestry 31261. </li>\n"
"  <li>23220 Hydro-electric power plants - Including energy generating river "

"  <li>23260 Geothermal energy - Use of geothermal energy for generating "
"electric power or directly as heat for agriculture, etc. </li>\n"
"  <li>23270- Biofuel-fired power plants Use of solids and liquids produced "

"waste fired power plants making use of biodegradable municipal waste "
"(household waste and waste from companies and public services that resembles "
"household waste, collected at installations specifically designed for their "
"disposal with recovery of combustible liquids, gases or heat). See code "
"23360 for non-renewable waste-fired power plants.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>Research and development of energy efficiency technologies and measures "
"is captured under CRS sector code 23182 on Energy research. The above flows "
"also include technical assistance provided to support production, research "
"and development as defined above.</p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>IRENA:</em></strong> The flows covered by IRENA are defined "
"as all additional loans, grants and equity investments received by "
"developing countries (defined as countries in developing regions, as listed "
"in the UN M49 composition of regions) from all foreign governments, "
"multilateral agencies and additional development finance institutions "
"(including export credits, where available) for the purpose of clean energy "

"the Creditor Reporting System (CRS data are considered complete from 1995 "

"available sources, including the databases and annual reports of all of the "
"main development finance institutions and 20 other bilateral and "
"multilateral agencies investing in renewable energy. The database is updated "
"annually and (at end-2016) covers public renewable energy investment flowing "
"to 29 developed countries and 104 developing countries, for the period "
"2000-2015. As new publicly-funded financial institutions start investing in "

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Total ODA and OOF flows to developing countries quantify the public "
"financial effort (excluding export credits) that donors provide to "
"developing countries for renewable energies. The additional flows (from the "
"IRENA database) capture the flows to non-ODA Recipients in developing "
"regions, flows from countries and institutions not currently reporting to "
"the DAC and certain other types of flows, such as export credits. </p>\n"
"<p>Energy access is a major development constraint in many developing "
"countries and, while starting from a relatively low base, energy demand is "
"expected to grow very rapidly in many of these countries in the future. This "
"presents an opportunity for developing countries to utilize clean and "
"renewable technologies to meet their future energy needs if they can gain "
"access to the appropriate technologies and expertise. This indicator "
"provides a suitable measure of the international support given to developing "
"countries to access these technologies.</p>"

"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>Data in the Creditor Reporting System are available from 1973. However, "
"the data coverage is considered complete since 1995 for commitments at an "
"activity level and 2002 for disbursements. At present, flows to clean energy "
"research and development are only partially covered by the database and a "
"few other areas (e.g. off-grid electricity supply, investments in improved "
"cookstove projects) may be covered only partially. </p>\n"
"<p>The IRENA database currently only covers financial institutions that have "
"invested a total of USD 400 million or more in renewable energy. The process "
"of continuous improvement of the database includes verifying the data "
"against data produced by the multilateral development banks for climate "
"finance reporting and by comparing the data with other independent reporting "
"by international development finance agencies.</p>"

"providers of development assistance to the sectors listed above. The IRENA "
"(additional) flows are calculated by taking the total public investment "
"flows from IRENA&#x2019;s Public Renewable Energy Investment Database and "

"<p>Data in IRENA are stored by country (source and recipient) at the project-"

"example, financial flows can be divided by technologies (i.e. bioenergy, "
