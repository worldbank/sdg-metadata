"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Mental disorders occur in all regions and cultures of the world. The most "
"prevalent of these disorders are depression and anxiety, which are estimated "
"to affect nearly 1 in 10 people. At its worst, depression can lead to "
"suicide. In 2012, there were over 800,000 estimated suicide deaths "
"worldwide. Suicide was the second leading cause of deaths among young adults "
"aged 15&#x2013;29 years, after road traffic injuries.</p>"

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2><strong>Comments and limitations</strong>:</h2>\n"
"<p>The complete recording of suicide deaths in death-registration systems "
"requires good linkages with coronial and police systems, but can be "
"seriously impeded by stigma, social and legal considerations, and delays in "
"determining cause of death. Less than one half of WHO Member States have "
"well-functioning death-registration systems that record causes of death.</p>"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>Suicide mortality rate (per 100,000 population) = (Number of suicide "
"deaths in a year x 100,000) / Mid-year population for the same calendar "
"year</p>\n"
"<p>The methods used for the analysis of causes of death depend on the type "
"of data available from countries:</p>\n"
"<p>For countries with a high-quality vital registration system including "
"information on cause of death, the vital registration that member states "
"submit to the WHO Mortality Database were used, with adjustments where "
"necessary, e.g. for under-reporting of deaths.</p>\n"
"<p>For countries without high-quality death registration data, cause of "
"death estimates are calculated using other data, including household surveys "
"with verbal autopsy, sample or sentinel registration systems, special "
"studies and surveillance systems. In most cases, these data sources are "
"combined in a modelling framework.</p>"

"<h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>\n"
"<p>In countries with high quality vital registration systems, point "

"codes Y10-Y34 and Y872) to suicide; and 2) WHO corrects for incomplete death "
