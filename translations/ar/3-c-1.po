"<h1>Data sources</h1>\n"
"<p>In response to WHA69.19, an online National Health Workforce Accounts "
"(NHWA) data platform was developed to facilitate national reporting. In "
"addition to the reporting, the platform also serves as an analytical tool at "
"the national/regional and global levels. Since Its launch in November 2017, "
"Member States are called to use the NHWA data platform to report health "
"workforce data. Complementing the national reporting through the NHWA data "
"platform, additional sources such as the National Census, Labour Force "
"Surveys and key administrative national and regional sources are also "
"employed. Most of the data from administrative sources are derived from "
"published national health sector reviews and/or official country reports to "
"WHO offices. Countries with missing data for the year 2016 (baseline value "
"for reporting of the WHO 13th Global Programme of Work) were estimated from "
"a linear model of density time trend based on at least five data points "
"including one reported density in the period 2011-2013.</p>"

"<p>Data on health workers tend to be more complete for the public health "
"sector and may underestimate the active workforce in the private, military, "
"nongovernmental organization and faith-based health sectors. In many cases, "
"information maintained at the national regulatory bodies and professional "
"councils are not updated.</p>\n"
"<p> </p>\n"
"<p>As data is not always published annually for each country, the latest "
"available data has been used. Due to the differences in data sources, "
"considerable variability remains across countries in the coverage, "
"periodicity, quality and completeness of the original data. Densities are "
"calculated using national population estimates from the United Nations "
"Population Division&apos;s World Population Prospects database and may vary "
"from densities produced by the country.</p>"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p><strong>Health worker densities by occupation:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>The figures for number of medical doctors (including generalist and "
"specialist medical practitioners) depending on the nature of the original "
"data source may include practising medical doctors only or all registered "
"medical doctors.</p>\n"
"<p>The figures for number of nursing and midwifery include nursing personnel "
"and midwifery personnel, whenever available. In many countries, nurses "
"trained with midwifery skills are counted and reported as nurses. This makes "
"the distinction between nursing personnel and midwifery personnel difficult "
"to draw.</p>\n"
"<p>The figures for number of dentists include dentists in the given national "
"and/or subnational area. Depending on the nature of the original data source "
"may include practising (active) only or all registered in the health "
"occupation. The ISCO -08 codes included here are 2261.</p>\n"
"<p>The figures for number of pharmacists include in the given national and/"
"or subnational area. Depending on the nature of the original data source may "
"include practising (active) only or all registered in the health occupation. "
"The ISCO -08 codes that relate to this occupation is 2262.</p>\n"
"<p>In general, the denominator data for workforce density (i.e. national "
"population estimates) are obtained from the United Nations Population "
"Division&apos;s World Population Prospects database. In cases where the "
"official health workforce report provides density indicators instead of "
"counts, estimates of the stock were then calculated using the population "
"estimated from the United Nations Population Division&apos;s World "
"population prospects database (2017). </p>\n"
"<p><strong>Health worker distribution by sex:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>The number of male medical doctors as reported by the country is "
"expressed as a percentage of total male and female medical doctors reported "
"by the country</p>\n"
"<p>The number of female medical doctors as reported by the country is "
