"<h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>\n"
"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p><strong><em>National Urban Policies and regional development plans: </"
"em></strong></p>\n"
"<p>A National Urban Policy (NUP) is defined as a coherent set of decisions "
"or principle of actions derived through a deliberate government led process "
"of coordinating and rallying various actors for a common vision and goal "
"that will promote more transformative, productive, inclusive, and resilient "
"urban development for the long term<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\" id="
"\"footnote-ref-1\">[1]</a></sup></sup>. </p>\n"
"<p>This standard definition is extended and adapted to country contexts and "
"may include, where applicable terms such as National Urban <em>Plan</em>, "
"<em>Framework</em>, or <em>Strategy</em> as long as they are aligned with "
"the above qualifiers. </p>\n"
"<p>Similarly, regional development plans follow the same definition, only "
"applied at the subnational level. </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>NUP that responds to population dynamics:  </em></strong></"
"p>\n"
"<p>This first qualifier examines to what extent the NUP addresses issues to "
"do with population composition, trends and projections in achieving "
"development goals and targets. </p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li><em>Population composition </em>includes size, geographic distribution "
"and density, household size and composition, mobility and migration, age and "
"sex distribution and disaggregation, as specified in SDG target 17.18 </li>\n"
"  <li><em>Trends </em>are changes in composition of the population from over "
"time </li>\n"
"  <li><em>Projections </em>are expected changes over time that the NUP needs "
"to ensure that they are well addressed.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>Key questions for the assessment: </p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>To what extent are quality and timely data on urban and rural "
"population composition, trends and projections available for use in the "
"development, implementation and monitoring of NUP or Regional Development "
"Plans (RDPs)? </li>\n"
"  <li>To what extent do the strategies/interventions of the NUP and/or RDPs "
"refer to population composition, trends and projections over the timeframe "
"of the plan? </li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Ensure balanced territorial development:  </em></strong></p>\n"
"<p>This second qualifier entails the promotion of a spatially coherent "
"territory that includes a balanced system of human settlements including "
"cities and towns and including urban corridors; that addresses social, "
"economic, environmental and spatial disparities particularly considering the "
"urban-rural continuum. </p>\n"
"<p>Key questions for the assessment: </p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>To what extent does the national urban policy consider the need for "
"balanced development of the territory as a whole including the "
"differentiated yet equivalent development of all types of settlements "
"including villages, cities and towns, including urban corridors? </li>\n"
"  <li>To what extent are the linkages &#x2013; social, economic, "
"environmental and spatial &#x2013; between urban, peri-urban and rural areas "
"consider with the ultimate goal of strengthening the urban-rural continuum? "
"</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Increase local fiscal space: </em></strong></p>\n"
"<p>Local fiscal space is understood as the sum of financial resources "
"available for improved delivery of basic social and economic services at the "
"local level as a result of the budget and related decisions by governments "
"at all levels without any prejudice to the sustainability of a "
"government&#x2019;s financial position. </p>\n"
"<p>Key questions for the assessment: </p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>To what extent has the policy made allowance for the provision of "
"local financial resources to provide for the implementation of the policy "
"and for the delivery of essential basic social and economic services </li>\n"
"  <li>To what extent has the policy assessed the status of human capacities "
"required to effectively use financial resources for the implementation of "
"the policy and the delivery of essential basic social and economic services? "
"</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Developing: </em></strong></p>\n"
"<p>Developing refers to the policy development pathways and processes that "
"consider the feasibility, diagnosis of policy problems and opportunities, "
"the formulation/drafting of the policy until the approval of the policy </"
"p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Implementing: </em></strong></p>\n"
"<p>Implementation refers to the realization of the policy proposal through "
"legislative or financial action/commitments, including the continued "
"monitoring and evaluation of that policy </p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>Introducing NUP &#x2013; an appropriate framework to achieve target 11.a "
"and more broadly a recognized tool of implementation and monitoring of "
"global urban agendas &#x2013; along with regional development plans, and "
"adding three measurable qualifiers as requirements for successful plans and "
"policies, makes indicator 11.a.1 not only a more adequate, measurable and "
"implementable process indicator for target 11.a.1, but also will serve more "
"broadly the progress of SDGs and the new urban agenda. </p>\n"
"<p>This revised indicator is indeed suitable for all countries and regions, "
"and lends itself to regional analyses, as well as other forms of aggregation "
"and disaggregation, according to development level, for example. It is also "
"applicable at multiple territorial levels. </p>\n"
"<p>Moreover, monitoring this indicator will help more broadly with NUP "
"monitoring and help increase awareness, capacity and knowledge of best "
"practices for sustainable urban policy in the process. Also, due to the "
"multidisciplinary dimension of NUPs and their role in global agendas, the "
"enhanced data collection and analysis capacity that would be permitted by "
"this indicator revision would participate in guiding the necessary steps to "
"create a more enabling urban policy environment to support SDG 11 and urban "
"dimensions of other SDGs. NUP monitoring according to SDGs would for "
"instance serve as a gap analysis to help formulate tailored recommendations "
"and identify best practices.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class="

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p><strong>National Urban Policies can help achieve target 11.a.1 </strong></"
"p>\n"
"<p>This indicator is based on the notion that the development and "
"implementation of National Urban Policies should support participation, "
"partnership, cooperation and coordination of actors as well as facilitate "
"dialogue. National Urban Policy (NUP) and Regional Development Plans (RDP) "
"promote coordinated and connected urban development. A coordinated effort "
"from government through a NUP or RDP provides the best opportunity for "
"achieving sustainable urbanization and balanced territorial development by "
"linking sectorial policies, connecting national, regional and local "
"government policies, strengthening urban, peri-urban and rural links through "
"balanced territorial development. </p>\n"
"<p> </p>\n"
"<p>This indicator provides a good barometer on global progress on "
"sustainable national urban policies. It serves as gap analysis to support "
"policy recommendations. The indicator can identify good practices and "
"policies among countries that can promote partnership and cooperation "
"between all stakeholders. This indicator is both process oriented and "
"aspirational and has the potential to support the validation of Goal 11 and "
"other SDGs indicators with an urban component. The indicator has the ability "
"to be applicable at multi jurisdictions levels, i.e covering a number of "
"areas while taking care of urban challenges in a more integrated national "
"manner. </p>\n"
"<p>The explicit introduction of National Urban Policy in the wording of "
"indicator 11.a.1 brings emphasis to a policy process that can better satisfy "
"the requirements of target 11.a through sectorial, territorial and "
"jurisdictional integration and coordination steered by the national level. "
"This is so because, evidence shows that NUP can <em>support positive "
"economic, social and environmental links</em> by ensuring at the highest "
"level of government the coherent alignment of sectorial policies to support "
"sustainable and inclusive urbanization<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id="
"\"footnote-ref-2\">[2]</a></sup></sup>. With the World increasingly "
"urbanizing, it is becoming clear today that how cities are managed and "
"planned has ramifications well beyond their boundaries and that urbanization "
"is a key force for national and sustainable development. </p>\n"
"<p>Urbanization has indeed historically been a catalyst for economic growth "
"and social progress, and even holds the possibility for the protection and "
"more efficient use of natural resources, and climate change mitigation and "
"adaptation. However, this positive impact is not automatic, particularly in "
"developing countries - where rapid and/or unplanned urbanization can bring "
"about negative economic, social and environmental externalities with "
"increasing congestion, sprawl, informality, social exclusion and conflict "
"&#x2013; if the provision of services and infrastructure does not keep up "
"with natural and internal population growth , equitable distribution, "
"migration patterns to the city, etc. Governments need to be sensitive to "
"this fact that urbanization is a nation-wide and multi-sectorial issue. "
"Therefore, NUPs provide the framework to harness urbanization dividends and "
"mitigate its negative externalities. A national urban policy calls attention "
"to the impact of sectorial governmental policies on the sustainable "
"development of cities and encourages and enables the vertical and horizontal "
"coordination of government departments and their policies to best support "
"it. </p>\n"
"<p>This consideration in turn also encourages more cooperation and "
"coordination between different levels of government to support the "
"development and implementation of a national vision for urban development, "
"effectively <em>strengthening national and regional development planning</"
"em>. The urban policy process is led at the national level to ensure the "
"articulation and coordination of different sectors and government levels but "
"engages both top down and bottom up processes. For a successful "
"implementation, a NUP must create an enabling, collaborative and cooperative "
"institutional environment, mobilizing different levels, assessing and "
"building their capacities, and establishing jointly defined and transparent "
"responsibilities for implementation. Subnational governments are key "
"implementation partner due to their proximity to citizens and role in "
"delivering services and infrastructure. As such, a NUP does not replace "
"regional and local development policies and plans but strengthens them and "
"relies on their horizontal alignment and vertical articulation, especially "
"to tackle cross boundary challenges such as sustainable resource management, "
"infrastructure development, climate change adaptation and mitigation, or "
"urban-rural linkages. </p>\n"
"<p>Finally, NUP as an overarching framework articulating and aligning "
"subnational and local plans and policies under a common vision for "
"urbanization that also makes it particularly suited to consider the urban-"
"peri-urban-rural continuum. This urban and rural consideration is a key "
"element of data disaggregation and administrative delineation in territorial "
"planning. However, the importance of urban-rural linkages (through flows of "
"people, natural resources, capital, goods, ecosystem services, information, "
"technology, ideas and innovation) is increasingly being acknowledged for "
"sustainable and integrated territorial development. The New Urban Agenda "
"(NUA) for instance stresses the need to reduce urban and rural disparities "
"to foster equitable development and encourage connectivity. Target 11.a is "
"the only one that explicitly considers <em>urban, peri-urban and rural "
"areas</em> under a city-centric SDG 11. NUP is the adequate framework to "
"strengthen and direct urban and rural flows towards the most sustainable "
"patterns of consumption and equitable resource distribution, as they can "
"strike the balance between competition and solidarity between territories of "
"a country. </p>\n"
"<p><strong>Urban Policies are more broadly instrumental for the "
"implementation and monitoring of global agendas </strong></p>\n"
"<p>National Urban Policies therefore enable a cross-sectorial approach, and "
"the horizontal and vertical institutional coordination needed to address the "
"challenges and opportunities of urbanization, which are increasingly "
"recognized as going beyond the boundaries of the city. Intergovernmental "
"agreements have indeed shown a new interest in urbanization for sustainable "
"development. This is illustrated of course in Agenda 2030 with its "
"introduction of a standalone urban SDG-11, but many other SDGs also have "
"clear urban dimensions and implications. Following the Agenda 2030, the "
"United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Development (Habitat "
"III) adopted the New Urban Agenda, a roadmap for the next 20 years setting "
"new global standards for sustainable urban development. Finally, although "
"the Paris Agreement on Climate Change does not explicitly mention cities, "
"the management of urbanization is still essential to addressing climate "
"change, as is illustrated by the fact that two third of Intended Nationally "
"Determined Contributions contain clear urban references and "
"content<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[3]</a></"
"sup></sup>. As an instrument for governments to harness the dynamics of "
"urbanization for national development, NUPs have therefore been identified "
"as a key tool for the implementation and monitoring of such agendas. </p>\n"
"<p>The Policy Paper on National Urban Policies prepared for Habitat III for "
"instance explained that a NUP should constitute an important part of any "
"serious attempt to implement the SDGs and should become a key instrument to "
"measure the achievement of the SDGs. As explained above, NUPs are a "
"particularly appropriate framework to achieve target 11.a, and more "
"generally can be instrumental in creating the necessary enabling framework "
"to implement the urban development objectives of SDG 11. For instance, the "
"NUA explicitly identifies NUPs as essential to achieve the urban paradigm "
"shift it advocates for, recognizing the leading role of national governments "
"[&#x2026;] in the implementation of inclusive and effective urban policies "
"and legislation for sustainable urban development (NUA &#x2013; 15.b). "
"Moreover, the Urban-Rural Linkages Guiding Principles provide practical "
"approach and actions to enhance territorial cohesion including via "
"policies<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-ref-4\">[4]</a></"
"sup></sup>. OECD set of urban and rural policies are additional frameworks "
"that are very important to enhance social, economic an economic links across "
"urban-rural and peri-urban territories<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-5\" id="
"\"footnote-ref-5\">[5]</a></sup></sup>. </p>\n"
"<p>Finally, NUPs can also be an instrument to coordinate the urban "
"components of NDCs across scales and sectors and mainstream the principles "
"of climate change adaptation and mitigation for the implementation of the "
"Paris Agreement<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-6\" id=\"footnote-ref-6\">[6]</"
"a></sup></sup>. </p>\n"
"<p><strong>Qualifiers for a measurable process indicator </strong></p>\n"
"<p>Given their instrumental role for the implementation and monitoring of "
"global urban agendas, the adoption of a NUP by a national government can be "
"considered as a strong indicator of political commitment to promoting "
"sustainable urban development. It also makes them particularly well suited "
"for measuring target 11.a through a process indicator. As a process "
"indicator, 11.a.1 is indeed supposed to assess the progress made towards "
"creating an enabling environment that will ensure achievement of the "
"outcomes and impacts of the targets of the Sustainable Development Agenda. "
"Its definition sets the foundation on <em>how </em>target 11.a can be "
"achieved, through measurable means. The proposed revision of the indicator "
"therefore supplements <em>national urban policies and regional development "
"plans </em>with 3 qualifiers that indicate the means of successfully "
"reaching the requirements of target 11.a. </p>\n"
"<p>The first qualifier is that policies and plans should <em>respond to "
"population dynamics</em>. Grounding policies and plans in the most current "
"and comprehensive spatial and demographic data and projections is indeed a "
"prerequisite for a successful implementation. The challenges posed by rapid "
"urbanization indeed stem from the fact that policy and planning framework "
"and their implementation are outpaced by population growth, coupled with "
"policy priorities that may not prioritize inclusive development for all "
"current and future urban residents, which together result in straining the "
"provision of infrastructure and services, and causing socio-economic and "
"environmental damages. Forecasting demographic trends and needs in the "
"diagnosis phase of policies and plans enables governments to plan ahead for "
"urbanization and provide adequate land and infrastructure in a more cost-"
"efficient and less socially disruptive way than trying to catch up, repair "
"and upgrade uncontrolled expansion. This process of developing urban "
"policies and plans can also be the occasion to improve national data "
"collection on urban areas, and serve other SDG-11 indicators, as well as "
"provide a baseline for monitoring the outcomes of such interventions. </p>\n"
"<p>The second qualifier requires policies and plans to <em>ensure balanced "
"territorial development</em>, in a direct answer to target 11.a.1&#x2019;s "
"reference to the urban, peri-urban and rural continuum. Policies and plans "
"should adopt a broad territorial perspective and consider the linkages and "
"flows from urban to rural areas not only to avoid and reduce social, "
"economic and environmental disparities between territories but also to "
"promote distinctive strengths and encourage beneficial interactions for the "
"most efficient path to sustainable growth for the country. Such a "
"perspective for policies and plans is achieved higher territorial scale than "
"cities, through regional plans and national policies. </p>\n"
"<p></p>\n"
"<p>Finally, the third qualifier is to <em>increase local fiscal space</em>. "
"As integrated NUPs and regional development plans introduce a more "
"coordinated and decentralized articulation of responsibilities for urban "
"development, ensuring that subnational and local governments have the "
"adequate financial resources to carry out their responsibilities is "
"essential to the successful implementation of policies and plans. The "
"transfer of competences from central to local levels must therefore be "
"accompanied by a commensurate devolution of financial resources and "
"autonomy. Moreover, in times of shrinking governmental budgets, the capacity "
"of local governments to expand and diversify endogenous financial resources "
"and revenues and not rely too heavily on central transfers should be "
"increased. This involves more fiscal power and capacity, better land value "
"capture mechanisms &#x2013; which go hand in hand with a clear and "
"enforceable land policy framework &#x2013; and innovative financial "
"partnerships, for instance collaborating with the private sector for service "
"and infrastructure delivery. In all cases, fiscal policies and mechanisms "
"must remain subordinated to the established urban policy and planning "
"objectives: central transfers must be embedded within the NUP framework, and "
"take into account territorial equity; and local fiscal systems must be "
"closely tied to local territorial plans so as to incentivize sustainable "
"patterns of development. </p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class="

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>The methodology uses a policy evaluation framework that assesses and "
"tracks progress on the extent to which country level national urban policy "
"or regional development plans are being developed or implemented to cover or "
"satisfy the following criteria: </p>\n"
"<ol>\n"
"  <li>Responds to population dynamics </li>\n"
"  <li>Ensures balanced regional and territorial development </li>\n"
"  <li>Increases local fiscal space </li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"<p>Essentially, countries that already have NUP and regional development "
"plans, the NUPs are examined for their consistency in covering the three "
"above qualifiers. While for countries that do not have NUP or are currently "
"developing NUP, these are noted and documented as steps towards developing a "
"NUP. Such countries are counted with zero scores to ensure a full coverage "
"of status on all countries. </p>\n"
"<p>To maintain the objectivity and comparability in the policy analysis, "
"five categories of assessment are used for each qualifier. These categories "
"correspond to a progressive evaluation of the extent to which national and "
"regional policies in plans integrate elements that contribute to the "
"realization of each qualifier: </p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>Category 1: policy document does not make any reference to the "
"qualifier or the country is not developing or implementing a policy (no "
"national urban policy exists) </li>\n"
"  <li>Category 2: policy document makes some reference to the specific "
"qualifier, but this qualifier is not integrated in the diagnosis and "
"recommendations of the policy </li>\n"
"  <li>Category 3: policy document integrates the specific qualifier, but "
"this qualifier is poorly understood or misinterpreted </li>\n"
"  <li>Category 4: policy document integrates in a cross-cutting perspective "
"the specific qualifier without clear policy recommendations </li>\n"
"  <li>Category 5: policy document integrates and mainstreams the specific "
"qualifier with clear policy recommendations derived from the qualifier </"
"li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>Each category is assigned a percentage bracket, as follows: </p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>Category 1: 0 per cent </li>\n"
"  <li>Category 2: 1-25 per cent </li>\n"
"  <li>Category 3: 26-50 per cent </li>\n"
"  <li>Category 4: 51-75 per cent </li>\n"
"  <li>Category 5: 76-100 per cent </li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>For example, in Table 1, the evaluator provides a numeric value based on "
"the category that corresponds to the qualifier analyzed, understanding that "
"only one category per qualifier is selected:</p>\n"
