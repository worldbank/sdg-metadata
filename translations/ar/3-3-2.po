"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>The tuberculosis incidence per 100,000 population as defined as the "
"estimated number of new and relapse TB cases (all forms of TB, including "
"cases in people living with HIV) arising in a given year, expressed as a "
"rate per 100 000 population.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>Direct measurement requires high-quality surveillance systems in which "
"underreporting is negligible, and strong health systems so that under-"
"diagnosis is also negligible; otherwise indirect estimates are based on "
"notification data and estimates of levels of underreporting and under-"
"diagnosis.</p>"

"communicated with countries. In selected countries with new survey data, "
"estimates are updated separately during the year. All estimates are "
"communicated in August-September and revisions are done based on feedback. "
"The final set of estimates is reviewed in WHO before publication in October, "

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Following two years of consultations, a new post-2015 global tuberculosis "
"strategy was endorsed by the World Health Assembly in May 2014. Known as the "
"End TB Strategy, it covers the period 2016-2035. The overall goal is to "
"&#x201C;End the global tuberculosis epidemic&#x201D;, and correspondingly "
"ambitious targets for reductions in tuberculosis deaths and cases are set "
"for 2030 (80% reduction in incidence rate compared with the level of 2015) "
"and 2035 (90% reduction in incidence rate), in the context of the SDGs. </"
"p>\n"
"<p>The tuberculosis incidence rate was selected as an indicator for "
"measuring reductions in the number of cases of disease burden. Although this "
"indicator was estimated with considerable uncertainty in most countries in "
"2014, notifications of cases to national authorities provide a good proxy if "
"there is limited under-reporting of detected cases and limited under or over-"
"diagnosis of cases.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>TB incidence has been used for over a century as a main indicator of TB "
"burden, along with TB mortality. The indicator allows comparisons over time "
"and between countries. Improvement in the quality of TB surveillance data "
"result in reduced uncertainty about indicator values.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "DATA_COMP"
msgid ""
"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>Estimates of TB incidence are produced through a consultative and "
"analytical process led by WHO and are published annually. These estimates "
"are based on annual case notifications, assessments of the quality and "
"coverage of TB notification data, national surveys of the prevalence of TB "
"disease and information from death (vital) registration systems.</p>\n"
"<p>Estimates of incidence for each country are derived, using one or more of "
"the following approaches depending on available data: (i) incidence = case "
"notifications/estimated proportion of cases detected; (ii) capture-recapture "
"modelling, (iii) incidence = prevalence/duration of condition.</p>\n"
"<p>Uncertainty bounds are provided in addition to best estimates.</p>\n"
"<p>Details are available from TB impact measurement: policy and "
"recommendations for how to assess the epidemiological burden of TB and the "
"impact of TB control and from the online technical appendix to the WHO "
"global tuberculosis report 2017 and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/"
