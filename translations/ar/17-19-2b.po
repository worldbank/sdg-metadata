"defined as: &#x201C;The registration in the civil registration system of "
"every vital event that has occurred to the members of the population of a "
"particular country (or area), within a specified period as a result of which "
"every such event has a vital registration record and the system has attained "

msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The introduction of indicator 17.19.2 (b) as part of the SDG global "
"framework reflects the recognition of the fundamental role of the civil "
"registration system to the functioning of societies, and the legal and "
"protective advantages that it offers to individuals. The essential purpose "
"of civil registration system is to furnish legal documents of direct "
"interest to individuals. Aside from the direct and overarching importance of "
"civil registration to the public authorities, in that the information "
"compiled using the registration method provides essential data for national "
"and regional preparation and planning for medical and health-care "
"programmes, the role played by civil registration in proving, establishing, "
"implementing and realizing many of the human rights embodied in "
"international declarations and conventions reflects one of its most "
"important contributions to the normal functioning of societies.</p>"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>The two sub-indicators of the indicator 17.19.2(b) are expressed as "
"proportions: at the global level, the proportion of countries that have "
"achieved 100 per cent birth registration is measured as the number of "
"countries that have achieved 100 per cent birth registration to the total "
"number of countries. The computation is done in an analogous manner for the "
"death registration part as well as for the regional measurements of both "
"birth and death registration sub-indicators. </p>\n"
"<p>The latest compiled data for this indicator are part of the Statistical "
"Annex to the 2017 SG&#x2019;s progress report, available at <a href="
"\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/report/2017/secretary-general-sdg-"
"report-2017--Statistical-Annex.pdf%20\">https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/"
"report/2017/secretary-general-sdg-report-2017--Statistical-Annex.pdf</a> "
"(please refer to the last two pages). These data are compiled using the "
"country-reported information on availability and completeness of birth and "
"death registration data at the country level, to the United Nations "
"<em>Demographic Yearbook</em>, via the <em>Demographic Yearbook </em>Vital "
"Statistics questionnaire and accompanying metadata. United Nations "
"<em>Demographic Yearbook </em>collection and associated online compilations "
"are published by the United Nations Statistics Division of the Department of "
"Economic and Social Affairs. Please refer to: <a href=\"https://unstats.un."
"org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/default.htm\">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/"
"demographic/products/dyb/default.htm</a> </p>\n"
"<p>At the present time, the thresholds used for compiling the data for the "
"indicator 17.19.2(b) are 90 per cent for birth registration and 75 per cent "
"for death registration, due to the classification that has been used in the "
"<em>Demographic Yearbook</em> metadata questionnaire on vital statistics. "
"This classification has currently been modified to enable reporting "
"according to the exact formulation of the indicator 17.19.2(b).</p>"
