msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The target &#x201C;By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable "
"energy in the global energy mix&#x201D; impacts all three dimensions of "
"sustainable development. Renewable energy technologies represent a major "
"element in strategies for greening economies everywhere in the world and for "
"tackling the critical global problem of climate change. A number of "
"definitions of renewable energy exist; what they have in common is "
"highlighting as renewable all forms of energy that their consumption does "
"not deplete their availability in the future. These include solar, wind, "
"ocean, hydropower, geothermal resources, and bioenergy (in the case of "
"bioenergy, which can be depleted, sources of bioenergy can be replaced "
"within a short to medium-term frame). Importantly, this indicator focuses on "
"the amount of renewable energy actually consumed rather than the capacity "
"for renewable energy production, which cannot always be fully utilized. By "
"focusing on consumption by the end user, it avoids the distortions caused by "
"the fact that conventional energy sources are subject to significant energy "
"losses along the production chain.</p>"

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"

"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>A limitation with existing renewable energy statistics is that they "
"are not able to distinguish whether renewable energy is being sustainably "
"produced. For example, a substantial share of today&#x2019;s renewable "
"energy consumption comes from the use of wood and charcoal by households in "
"the developing world, which sometimes may be associated with unsustainable "
"forestry practices. There are efforts underway to improve the ability to "
"measure the sustainability of bio-energy, although this remains a "
"significant challenge. </li>\n"
"  <li>Off-grid renewables data are limited and not sufficiently captured in "
"the energy statistics </li>\n"
"  <li>The method of allocation of renewable energy consumption from "
"electricity and heat output assumes that the share of transmission and "
"distribution losses are the same between all technologies. However, this is "
"not always true because renewables are usually located in more remote areas "
"from consumption centers and may incur larger losses. </li>\n"
"  <li>Likewise, imports and exports of electricity and heat are assumed to "
"follow the share of renewability of electricity and heat generation, "
"respectively. This is a simplification that in many cases will not affect "
"the indicator too much, but that might do so in some cases, for example, "
"when a country only generates electricity from fossil fuels but imports a "
"great share of the electricity it uses from a neighboring country&#x2019;s "
"hydroelectric power plant. </li>\n"
"  <li>Methodological challenges associated with defining and measuring "
"renewable energy are more fully described in the Global Tracking Framework "
"(IEA and World Bank, 2013) Chapter 4, Section 1, pages 194-200. Data for "
"traditional use of solid biofuels are generally scarce globally, and "
"developing capacity in tracking such energy use, including developing "
"national level surveys, is essential for sound global energy tracking.</li>\n"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>This indicator is based on the development of comprehensive energy "
"statistics across supply and demand for all energy sources &#x2013; "
"statistics used to produce a national energy balance. Internationally agreed "
"methodologies for energy statistics are described in the &#x201C;"
"International Recommendations for Energy Statistics&#x201D; (IRES), adopted "
"by the UN Statistical Commission, available at: <a href=\"file:///C:\\Users"
"\\leonardo.souza\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCache\\Content."
"Outlook\\6GFD9MJP\\unstats.un.org\\unsd\\energystats\\methodology\\ires"
"\">unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/methodology/ires</a>.</p>\n"
"<p>Once a national energy balance is developed, the indicator can be "
"calculated by dividing final energy consumption from all renewable sources "
"by total final energy consumption. Renewable energy consumption is derived "
"from three tables of the IEA world energy statistics and balances: total "
"final consumption, electricity output and heat output. All volumes reported "
"in the total final consumption table are taken as reported. Since volumes "
"for electricity and heat in the final consumption table are not broken down "
"by technology, electricity and heat output tables are used instead to break "
"down final consumption of electricity and heat by technology. The allocation "
"by technology is done by deriving the share of technology in electricity and "
"heat output tables and multiplying that share by final energy consumption of "
"electricity and heat, respectively. For instance, if total final consumption "
"table reports 150 TJ for biogas energy, while total final consumption of "
"electricity is 400 TJ and heat 100 TJ, and the share of biogas in total "
"electricity output is 10 percent and 5 percent in heat, the total reported "
"number for biogas consumption will be 195 TJ (150 TJ+400TJ*10%+100TJ*5%). "
"The Global Tracking Framework Report (IEA and World Bank, 2013) provides "
"more details on the suggested methodology for defining and measuring "
"renewable energy (Chapter 4, Section 1, page 201-202). UNSD follows the same "
"methodology to compute the indicators, though information may come from "
"different tables.</p>"

"<p>Between the various existing data sources, primarily the IEA Energy "

"energy consumption for every country and area can be collected. The "
"<em>Tracking SDG7: The Energy Progress Report</em> (formerly <em>Sustainable "

"resource and end-use sector, could provide insights into other dimensions of "
"the goal, such as affordability and reliability. For solar energy, it may "
"also be of interest to disaggregate between on grid and off-grid capacity. </"
