msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator is explicitly referenced in the text of target 4.1: &#x2018;"
"<em>ensure that all girls and boys complete [&#x2026;] primary and secondary "
"education</em>&#x2019;. A completion rate at or near 100% indicates that all "
"or most children and adolescents have completed a level of education by the "
"time they are 3 to 5 years older than the official age of entry into the "
"last grade of that level of education. A low completion rate indicates low "
"or delayed entry into a given level of education, high drop-out, high "
"repetition, late completion, or a combination of these factors.</p>\n"
"<p>The completion rate can be used either as a self-standing indicator or in "
"combination with SDG indicator 4.1.1 (proportion of children and young "
"people (a) in Grade 2 or 3; (b) at the end of primary education; and (c) at "
"the end of lower secondary education achieving at least a minimum "
"proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics). Combining the "
"completion rate with indicator 4.1.1 provides information on the percentage "
"of children or young people <em>in a cohort</em> who achieve a minimum level "
"of proficiency, and not only on the percentage of children<em> in school</"
"em> who achieve minimum proficiency.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>The age group 3-5 years above the official age of entry into the last "
"grade for a given level of education was selected for the calculation of the "
"completion rate to allow for some delayed entry or repetition. In countries "
"where entry can occur very late or where repetition is common, some children "
"or adolescents in the age group examined may still attend school and the "
"eventual rate of completion may therefore be underestimated.</p>\n"
"<p>The indicator is calculated from household survey data and is subject to "
"time lag in the availability of data. When multiple surveys are available, "
"they may provide conflicting information due to the possible presence of "
"sampling and non-sampling errors in survey data. The Technical Cooperation "
"Group on the Indicators for SDG 4 - Education 2030 (TCG) has requested a "
"refinement of the methodology to model completion rate estimates, following "
"an approach similar to that used for the estimation of child mortality "
"rates. The model would ensure that common challenges with household survey "
"data, such as timeliness and sampling or non-sampling errors are addressed "
"to provide up-to-date and more robust data. </p>"
