"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>Forest area as a proportion of total land area</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>In order to provide a precise definition of the indicator, it is crucial "
"to provide a definition of &#x201C;Forest&#x201D; and &#x201C;Total Land "
"Area&#x201D;. </p>\n"
"<p>According to the FAO definitions, Forest is defined as: &#x201C;land "
"spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy "
"cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in "
"situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or "
"urban land use&#x201D;. More specifically:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>Forest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of "
"other predominant land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum "
"height of 5 meters.</li>\n"
"  <li>It includes areas with young trees that have not yet reached but which "
"are expected to reach a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height "
"of 5 meters or more. It also includes areas that are temporarily unstocked "
"due to clear-cutting as part of a forest management practice or natural "
"disasters, and which are expected to be regenerated within 5 years. Local "
"conditions may, in exceptional cases, justify that a longer time frame is "
"used.</li>\n"
"  <li>It includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; "
"forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as "
"those of specific environmental, scientific, historical, cultural or "
"spiritual interest.</li>\n"
"  <li>It includes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an "
"area of more than 0.5 hectares and width of more than 20 meters.</li>\n"
"  <li>It includes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of "
"trees that have, or are expected to reach, a canopy cover of at least 10 "
"percent and tree height of at least 5 meters.</li>\n"
"  <li>It includes areas with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless whether "
"this area is classified as land area or not.</li>\n"
"  <li>It includes rubberwood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations.</li>\n"
"  <li>It includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height "
"and canopy cover criteria are met.</li>\n"
"  <li>It excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as "
"fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive orchards and "
"agroforestry systems when crops are grown under tree cover. Note: Some "
"agroforestry systems such as the &#x201C;Taungya&#x201D; system where crops "
"are grown only during the first years of the forest rotation should be "
"classified as forest.</li>\n"

"<p>FAO has been monitoring the world&apos;s forests at 5 to 10 year "

"produced every five year. The latest of these assessments, FRA 2020, "

"<h2>Collection process:</h2>\n"
"<p>Officially nominated national correspondents and their teams prepare the "

"using existing information, literature search, remote sensing or a "
"combination of two or more of them.</p>\n"
"<p>All data are provided to FAO by countries in the form of a country report "
"through an on-line platform following a standard format, which includes the "
"original data and reference sources and descriptions of how these have been "

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Forests fulfil a number of functions that are vital for humanity, "
"including the provision of goods (wood and non-wood forest products) and "
"services such as habitats for biodiversity, carbon sequestration, coastal "
"protection and soil and water conservation. </p>\n"
"<p>The indicator provides a measure of the relative extent of forest in a "
"country. The availability of accurate data on a country&apos;s forest area "
"is a key element for forest policy and planning within the context of "
"sustainable development.</p>\n"
"<p>Changes in forest area reflect the demand for land for other uses and may "
"help identify unsustainable practices in the forestry and agricultural "
"sector.</p>\n"
"<p>Forest area as percentage of total land area may be used as a rough proxy "
"for the extent to which the forests in a country are being conserved or "
"restored, but it is only partly a measure for the extent to which they are "
"sustainably managed.</p>\n"

"Development Goals (MDG) (indicator 7.1 &#x201C;Proportion of land covered by "

"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>Assessment of forest area is carried out at infrequent intervals in many "
"countries. Although the improved access to remote sensing data can help some "
"countries to update their forest area estimates more frequently, estimation "
"of forest area using remote sensing techniques for has certain challenges. "
"In particular they relate to the assessment of land use (remote sensing "
"primarily assesses land cover), and gradual changes, such as forest "
"regrowth, that can require several years to become detectable. In addition, "
"forest area with low canopy cover density (e.g. 10-30%) are still difficult "
"to detect at large scale with affordable remote sensing techniques.</p>"
