"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>The Red List Index measures change in aggregate extinction risk across "
"groups of species. It is based on genuine changes in the number of species "
"in each category of extinction risk on The IUCN Red List of Threatened "
"Species (IUCN 2015) is expressed as changes in an index ranging from 0 to 1."
"</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>Threatened species are those listed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened "
"Species in the categories Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered "
"(i.e., species that are facing a high, very high, or extremely high risk of "
"extinction in the wild in the medium-term future). Changes over time in the "
"proportion of species threatened with extinction are largely driven by "
"improvements in knowledge and changing taxonomy. The indicator excludes such "
"changes to yield a more informative indicator than the simple proportion of "
"threatened species. It therefore measures change in aggregate extinction "
"risk across groups of species over time, resulting from genuine improvements "
"or deteriorations in the status of individual species. It can be calculated "
"for any representative set of species that have been assessed for The IUCN "
"Red List of Threatened Species at least twice (Butchart et al. 2004, 2005, "

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The world&#x2019;s species are impacted by a number of threatening "
"processes, including habitat destruction and degradation, overexploitation, "
"invasive alien species, human disturbance, pollution and climate change. "
"This indicator can be used to assess overall changes in the extinction risk "
"of groups of species as a result of these threats and the extent to which "
"threats are being mitigated.</p>\n"
"<p>The Red List Index value ranges from 1 (all species are categorized as "
"&#x2018;Least Concern&#x2019;) to 0 (all species are categorized as &#x2018;"
"Extinct&#x2019;), and so indicates how far the set of species has moved "
"overall towards extinction. Thus, the Red List Index allows comparisons "
"between sets of species in both their overall level of extinction risk (i."
"e., how threatened they are on average), and in the rate at which this risk "
"changes over time. A downward trend in the Red List Index over time means "
"that the expected rate of future species extinctions is worsening (i.e., the "
"rate of biodiversity loss is increasing). An upward trend means that the "
"expected rate of species extinctions is abating (i.e., the rate of "
"biodiversity loss is decreasing), and a horizontal line means that the "
"expected rate of species extinctions is remaining the same, although in each "
"of these cases it does not mean that biodiversity loss has stopped. An "
"upward Red List Index trend would indicate that the SDG Target 15.5 of "
"reducing the degradation of natural habitats and protecting threatened "
"species is on track. A Red List Index value of 1 would indicate that "
"biodiversity loss has been halted.</p>\n"
"<p>The name &#x201C;Red List Index&#x201D; should not be taken to imply that "
"the indicator is produced as a composite indicator of a number of disparate "
"metrics (in the same way that, e.g., the Multidimensional Poverty Index is "
"compiled). The Red List Index provides an indicator of trends in "
"species&#x2019; extinction risk, as measured using the IUCN Red List "
"Categories and Criteria (Mace et al. 2008, IUCN 2012a), and is compiled from "
"data on changes over time in the Red List Category for each species, "
"excluding any changes driven by improved knowledge or revised taxonomy.</p>\n"
"<p>The Red List Index is used as an indicator towards the 2011&#x2013;2020 "
"Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014), and was "
"used as an indicator towards the Convention on Biological Diversity&#x2019;s "
"2010 Target (Butchart et al. 2010) and Millennium Development Goal 7. It can "
"also be projected to assess future development scenarios (Visconti et al. "
"2015).</p>"

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>There are four main sources of uncertainty associated with Red List Index "
"values and trends.</p>\n"
"<ol>\n"
"  <li>Inadequate, incomplete or inaccurate knowledge of a species&#x2019; "
"status. This uncertainty is minimized by assigning estimates of extinction "
"risk to categories that are broad in magnitude and timing.</li>\n"
"  <li>Delays in knowledge about a species becoming available for assessment. "
"Such delays apply to a small (and diminishing) proportion of status changes, "
"and can be overcome in the Red List Index through back-casting.</li>\n"
"  <li>Inconsistency between species assessments. These can be minimized by "
"the requirement to provide supporting documentation detailing the best "
"available data, with justifications, sources, and estimates of uncertainty "
"and data quality, which are checked and standardized by IUCN through Red "
"List Authorities, a Red List Technical Working Group and an independent "
"Standards and Petitions Sub-committee. Further, detailed Guidelines on the "
"Application of the Categories and Criteria are maintained (IUCN SPSC 2016), "
"as is an online training course (in English, Spanish and French).</li>\n"
"  <li>Species that are too poorly known for the Red List Criteria to be "
"applied are assigned to the Data Deficient category, and excluded from the "
"calculation of the Red List Index. For birds, only 0.8% of extant species "
"are evaluated as Data Deficient, compared with 24% of amphibians. If Data "
"Deficient species differ in the rate at which their extinction risk is "
"changing, the Red List Index may give a biased picture of the changing "
"extinction risk of the overall set of species. The degree of uncertainty "
"this introduces is estimated through a bootstrapping procedure that randomly "
"assigns each Data Deficient species a category based on the numbers of non-"
"Data Deficient species in each Red List category for the set of species "
"under consideration, and repeats this for 1,000 iterations, plotting the 2.5 "
"and 97.5 percentiles as lower and upper confidence intervals for the median."
"</li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"<p>The main limitation of the Red List Index is related to the fact that the "
"Red List Categories are relatively broad measures of status, and thus the "
"Red List Index for any individual taxonomic group can practically be updated "
"at intervals of at least four years. As the overall index is aggregated "
"across multiple taxonomic groups, it can be updated typically annually. In "
"addition, the Red List Index does not capture particularly well the "
"deteriorating status of common species that remain abundant and widespread "
"but are declining slowly.</p>"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>The Red List Index is calculated at a point in time by first multiplying "
"the number of species in each Red List Category by a weight (ranging from 1 "
"for &#x2018;Near Threatened&#x2019; to 5 for &#x2018;Extinct&#x2019; and "
"&#x2018;Extinct in the Wild&#x2019;) and summing these values. This is then "
"divided by a maximum threat score which is the total number of species "
"multiplied by the weight assigned to the &#x2018;Extinct&#x2019; category. "
"This final value is subtracted from 1 to give the Red List Index value.</p>\n"
"<p>Mathematically this calculation is expressed as: </p>\n"
"<p>RLIt = 1 &#x2013; [(Ss Wc(t,s) / (WEX * N)]</p>\n"
"<p>Where Wc(t,s) is the weight for category (c) at time (t) for species (s) "
"(the weight for &#x2018;Critically Endangered&#x2019; = 4, &#x2018;"
"Endangered&#x2019; = 3, &#x2018;Vulnerable&#x2019; = 2, &#x2018;Near "
"Threatened&#x2019; = 1, &#x2018;Least Concern&#x2019; = 0. &#x2018;"
"Critically Endangered&#x2019; species tagged as &#x2018;Possibly "
"Extinct&#x2019; or &#x2018;Possibly Extinct in the Wild&#x2019; are assigned "
"a weight of 5); WEX = 5, the weight assigned to &#x2018;Extinct&#x2019; or "
"&#x2018;Extinct in the Wild&#x2019; species; and N is the total number of "
"assessed species, excluding those assessed as Data Deficient in the current "
"time period, and those considered to be &#x2018;Extinct&#x2019; in the year "
"the set of species was first assessed.</p>\n"
"<p>The formula requires that:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>Exactly the same set of species is included in all time periods, and</"
"li>\n"
"  <li>The only Red List Category changes are those resulting from genuine "
"improvement or deterioration in status (i.e., excluding changes resulting "
"from improved knowledge or taxonomic revisions), and</li>\n"
"  <li>Data Deficient species are excluded.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>In many cases, species lists will change slightly from one assessment to "
"the next (e.g., owing to taxonomic revisions). The conditions can therefore "
"be met by retrospectively adjusting earlier Red List categorizations using "
"current information and taxonomy. This is achieved by assuming that the "
"current Red List Categories for the taxa have applied since the set of "
"species was first assessed for the Red List, unless there is information to "
"the contrary that genuine status changes have occurred. Such information is "
"often contextual (e.g., relating to the known history of habitat loss within "
"the range of the species). If there is insufficient information available "
"for a newly added species, it is not incorporated into the Red List Index "
"until it is assessed for a second time, at which point earlier assessments "
"are retrospectively corrected by extrapolating recent trends in population, "
"range, habitat and threats, supported by additional information. To avoid "
"spurious results from biased selection of species, Red List Indices are "
"typically calculated only for taxonomic groups in which all species "
"worldwide have been assessed for the Red List, or for samples of species "
"that have been systematically or randomly selected.</p>\n"
"<p>The methods and scientific basis for the Red List Index were described by "
"Butchart et al. (2004, 2005, 2007, 2010). </p>\n"
"<p>Butchart et al. (2010) also described the methods by which Red List "
"Indices for different taxonomic groups are aggregated to produce a single "
"multi-taxon Red List Index. Specifically, aggregated Red List Indices are "
"calculated as the arithmetic mean of modelled Red List Indices. Red List "
"Indices for each taxonomic group are interpolated linearly for years between "
"data points and extrapolated linearly (with a slope equal to that between "
"the two closest assessed points) to align them with years for which Red List "
"Indices for other taxa are available. The Red List Indices for each "
"taxonomic group for each year are modelled to take into account various "
"sources of uncertainty: </p>\n"
"<ol>\n"
"  <li>Data Deficiency: Red List categories (from Least Concern to Extinct) "
"are assigned to all Data Deficient species, with a probability proportional "
"to the number of species in non-Data Deficient categories for that taxonomic "
"group; </li>\n"
"  <li>Extrapolation uncertainty: although RLIs were extrapolated linearly "
"based on the slope of the closest two assessed point, there is uncertainty "
"about how accurate this slope may be. To incorporate this uncertainty, "
"rather than extrapolating deterministically, the slope used for "
"extrapolation is selected from a normal distribution with a probability "
"equal to the slope of the closest two assessed points, and standard "
"deviation equal to 60% of this slope (i.e., the CV is 60%); </li>\n"
"  <li>Temporal variability: the &#x2018;true&#x2019; Red List Index likely "
"changes from year to year, but because assessments are repeated only at "
"multi-year intervals, the precise value for any particular year is "
"uncertain. </li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"<p>To make this uncertainty explicit, the Red List Index value for a given "
"taxonomic group in a given year is assigned from a moving window of five "
"years, centred on the focal year (with the window set as 3-4 years for the "
"first two and last two years in the series). Note that assessment "
"uncertainty cannot yet be incorporated into the index. Practically, these "
"uncertainties are incorporated into the aggregated Red List Indices as "
"follows: Data Deficient species were allotted a category as described above, "
"and a Red List Index for each taxonomic group was calculated interpolating "
"and extrapolating as described above. A final Red List Index value was "
"assigned to each taxonomic group for each year from a window of years as "
"described above. Each such &#x2018;run&#x2019; produced a Red List Index for "
"the complete time period for each taxonomic group, incorporating the various "
"sources of uncertainty. Ten thousand such runs are generated for each "
"taxonomic group, and the mean is calculated.</p>\n"

"<h1>Data availability</h1>\n"
"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>The Red List Index has been classified by the IAEG-SDGs as Tier 1. "
"Current data are available for all countries in the world, and these are "
"updated on a regular basis (approximately once every four years).</p>\n"
"<h2>Time series:</h2>\n"
"<p>Since 1980 (approximately 35 years). </p>\n"
"<h2>Disaggregation:</h2>\n"
"<p>The Red List Index can be downscaled to show national and regional Red "
"List Indices, weighted by the fraction of each species&#x2019; distribution "
"occurring within the country or region, building on the method published by "
"Rodrigues et al. (2014) PLoS ONE 9(11): e113934. These show an index of "
"aggregate survival probability (the inverse of extinction risk) for all "
"birds, mammals, amphibians, corals and cycads occurring within the country "
"or region. The index shows how well species are conserved in a country or "
"region to its potential contribution to global species conservation. The "
"index is calculated as: </p>\n"
"<p>RLI(t,u) = 1 &#x2013; [(Ss(W(t,s) * (rsu/Rs)) / (WEX * Ss (rsu/Rs))</p>\n"
"<p>where t is the year of comprehensive reassessment, u is the spatial unit "
"(i.e. country), W_((t,s)) is the weight of the global Red List category for "
"species s at time t (Least Concern =0, Near Threatened =1, Vulnerable =2, "
"Endangered =3, Critically Endangered =4, Critically Endangered (Possibly "
"Extinct) =5, Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct in the Wild) =5, "
"Extinct in the Wild =5 and Extinct =5), WEX = 5 is the weight for Extinct "
"species, r_su is the fraction of the total range of species s in unit u, and "
"R_s is the total range size of species s.</p>\n"
"<p>The index varies from 1 if the country has contributed the minimum it can "
"to the global RLI (i.e., if the numerator is 0 because all species in the "
"country are LC) to 0 if the country has contributed the maximum it can to "
"the global RLI (i.e., if the numerator equals the denominator because all "
"species in the country are Extinct or Possibly Extinct). </p>\n"
"<p>The taxonomic groups included are those in which all species have been "
"assessed for the IUCN Red List more than once. Red List categories for years "
"in which comprehensive assessments (i.e. those in which all species in the "
"taxonomic group have been assessed) were carried out are determined "
"following the approach of Butchart et al. 2007; PLoS ONE 2(1): e140, i.e. "
"they match the current categories except for those taxa that have undergone "
"genuine improvement or deterioration in extinction risk of sufficient "
"magnitude to qualify for a higher or lower Red List category.</p>\n"
"<p>The indicator can also be disaggregated by ecosystems, habitats, and "
"other political and geographic divisions (e.g., Han et al. 2014), by "
"taxonomic subsets (e.g., Hoffmann et al. 2011), by suites of species "
"relevant to particular international treaties or legislation (e.g., Croxall "
"et al. 2012), by suites of species exposed to particular threatening "
"processes (e.g., Butchart 2008), and by suites of species that deliver "
"particular ecosystem services, or have particular biological or life-history "
"traits (e.g., Regan et al. 2015). In each case, information can be obtained "
"from The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species to determine which species are "
"relevant to particular subsets (e.g. which occur in particular ecosystems, "
"habitats, and geographic areas of interest).</p>\n"
"<p>Disaggregations of the Red List Index are also of particular relevance as "
"indicators towards the following SDG targets (Brooks et al. 2015): SDG 2.4 "
"Red List Index (species used for food and medicine); SDG 2.5 Red List Index "
"(wild relatives and local breeds); SDG 12.2 Red List Index (impacts of "
"utilisation) (Butchart 2008); SDG 12.4 Red List Index (impacts of "
"pollution); SDG 13.1 Red List Index (impacts of climate change); SDG 14.1 "
"Red List Index (impacts of pollution on marine species); SDG 14.2 Red List "
"Index (marine species); SDG 14.3 Red List Index (reef-building coral "
"species) (Carpenter et al. 2008); SDG 14.4 Red List Index (impacts of "
"utilisation on marine species) &#x2013; an ad hoc joint FAO-IUCN Technical "
"Expert Group is currently working to develop agreed recommendations on the "
"use and interpretation of this indicator; SDG 15.1 Red List Index "
"(terrestrial &amp; freshwater species); SDG 15.2 Red List Index (forest-"
"specialist species); SDG 15.4 Red List Index (mountain species); SDG 15.7 "
"Red List Index (impacts of utilisation) (Butchart 2008); and SDG 15.8 Red "
"List Index (impacts of invasive alien species) (Butchart 2008, McGeoch et "
"al. 2010).</p>"

msgctxt "COMPARABILITY"
msgid ""
"<h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>\n"
"<p>Some countries have assessed the national extinction risk of species "
"occurring in the country, and have repeated such assessments, allowing a "
"national Red List Index to be produced. This may differ from the indicator "
"described here because (a) it considers national rather than global "
"extinction risk, and (b) because it takes no account of the national "
"responsibility for the conservation of each species, treating as equal both "
"those species that occur nowhere outside the country (i.e. national "
"endemics) and those with large ranges that occur in many other countries. "
"Any such differences will be smaller for countries within which a high "
"proportion of species are endemic (i.e., only found in that country), as in "
"many island nations and mountainous countries, especially in the tropics. "
"The differences will be larger for countries within which a high proportion "
"of species have widespread distributions across many nations.</p>"
