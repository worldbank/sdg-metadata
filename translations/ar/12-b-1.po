msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The UNWTO Committee on Statistics<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\" id="
"\"footnote-ref-1\">[1]</a></sup></sup>, the leading international group in "
"tourism statistics composed of experts from countries and international "
"organizations, has since 2016 identified important difficulties with the "
"original indicator: </p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>The indicator does not track the target well.</li>\n"
"  <li>The indicator is not statistically based. There is no internationally "
"agreed statistical framework or concepts/definitions that can be applied to "
"&#x201C;sustainable tourism strategies or policies and implemented action "
"plans&#x201D;. </li>\n"
"  <li>It is not clear what the relationship/boundary is between the three "
"different instruments mentioned: &#x201C;strategies&#x201D;, &#x201C;"
"policies&#x201D;, and &#x201C;implemented action plans&#x201D;. For example, "
"a tourism master plan may contain elements of all three - would this count "
"as 1 or 3? </li>\n"
"  <li>There is no statistical infrastructure in place in countries for "
"collecting this information, and it would seem difficult to develop it due "
"to the above mentioned issues;</li>\n"
"  <li>The absence of internationally agreed definitions on these concepts "
"and of related statistical processes would mean that data collection, should "
"it take place, would be affected by each country respondent&#x2019;s "
"interpretation of the terms &#x201C;strategies&#x201D;, &#x201C;"
"policies&#x201D;, and &#x201C;implemented action plans&#x201D;. This would "
"be accentuated by the fact that country officials would need to be asked to "
"self-assess their countries&#x2019; situation, leading to a significant "
"respondent bias. </li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>It is thus proposed to focus on the target (&quot;develop and implement "
"tools to monitor sustainable [tourism])&#x201D; and monitor the stage of "
"implementation in countries of the main accounting tools <em>to date</em> "
"for the international monitoring of key sustainability aspects of tourism "
"which are:</p>\n"
"<ol>\n"
"  <li>countries&#x2019; Tourism Satellite Account based on the <a href="
"\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/tradeserv/tourism/manual.html\" target=\"_blank"
"\"><em>Tourism Satellite Account: Recommended Methodological Framework 2008</"
"em></a> (TSA: RMF 2008) and </li>\n"
"  <li>countries&#x2019; water, energy, GHG emissions and waste accounts "
"based the <a href=\"https://seea.un.org/content/seea-central-framework"
"\"><em>System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA)</em></a>. </li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"<p> </p>\n"
"<p>This yields a statistically-based indicator for monitoring target 12.b. "
"by tracking the degree of implementation in countries of the TSA and SEEA "
"tables that are most relevant and feasible for monitoring sustainability in "
"tourism.</p>\n"
