"<h1>Data sources</h1>\n"
"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>Nationally-representative estimates of child mortality can be derived "
"from a number of different sources, including civil registration and sample "
"surveys. Demographic surveillance sites and hospital data are excluded as "
"they are rarely representative. The preferred source of data is a civil "
"registration system that records births and deaths on a continuous basis. If "
"registration is complete and the system functions efficiently, the resulting "
"estimates will be accurate and timely. However, many countries do not have "
"well-functioning vital registration systems. In such cases household "
"surveys, such as the UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys "
"(MICS), the USAID-supported Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and "
"periodic population censuses have become the primary sources of data on "
"under-five and neonatal mortality. These surveys ask women about the "
"survival of their children, and it is these reports that provide the basis "
"of child mortality estimates for a majority of low- and middle- income "
"countries. These data, however, are often subject to sampling or/and non-"
"sampling errors, which might be substantial.</p>\n"
"<h2><em>Civil registration</em></h2>\n"
"<p>Civil registration data are the preferred data source for under-five, "
"infant and neonatal mortality estimation. The calculation of neonatal "
"mortality rates are derived from the number of neonatal deaths and number of "
"births over a period. For civil registration data (with available data on "
"the number of deaths and mid-year populations), initially annual "
"observations were constructed for all observation years in a country.</p>\n"
"<h2><em>Population census and household survey data</em></h2>\n"
"<p>The majority of survey data comes from the full birth history (FBH), "
"whereby women are asked for the date of birth of each of their children, "
"whether the child is still alive, and if not the age at death.</p>"

msgctxt "COLL_METHOD"
msgid ""
"<h2>Collection process:</h2>\n"
"<p>For neonatal mortality, UNICEF and the UN IGME compile data from all "
"available data sources, including household surveys, censuses, vital "
"registration data etc. UNICEF and the UN IGME compile these data whenever "
"they are available publicly and then conduct data quality assessment. UNICEF "
"also collects data through UNICEF country offices by reaching national "
"counterpart(s). The UN IGME also collects vital registration data reported "
"by Ministries of Health or other relevant agencies to WHO. </p>\n"
"<p>Adjustments of empirical data are made in high prevalence HIV settings to "
"adjust for under reporting of child mortality due to missing mothers in "
"survey data. UN IGME than applies a curve fitting method to these empirical "
"data to derive the UN IGME trend estimates of the neonatal mortality rates. "
"Because deaths by crisis are difficult to capture in household survey or "
"census data, UN IGME adjusts the neonatal mortality estimates for crisis "
"mortality.</p>\n"
"<p>Then the UN IGME conducts an annual country consultation by sending the "
"UN IGME estimates, empirical data used to derive the UN IGME estimates, and "
"notes on methodology to National Statistical Offices, and to Ministries of "
"Health or relevant agencies for feedback on the UN IGME estimates and the "
"empirical data. National Statistical Offices, Ministries of Health or "
"relevant agencies review the UN IGME estimates and empirical data, send "
"feedback or comments, and sometimes supply additional empirical data.</p>\n"
"<p>To increase the transparency of the estimation process, the UN IGME has "
"developed a child mortality web portal: CME (www.childmortality.org). It "
"includes all available data and shows estimates for each country. Once the "
"new estimates are finalized, CME will be updated to reflect all available "
"data and the new estimates.</p>"

"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Mortality rates among young children are a key output indicator for child "
"health and well-being, and, more broadly, for social and economic "
"development. It is a closely watched public health indicator because it "
"reflects the access of children and communities to basic health "
"interventions such as vaccination, medical treatment of infectious diseases "
"and adequate nutrition.</p>"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>The UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) "
"estimates are derived from nationally representative data from censuses, "
"surveys or vital registration systems. The UN IGME does not use any "
"covariates to derive its estimates. It only applies a curve fitting method "
"to good-quality empirical data to derive trend estimates after data quality "
"assessment. In most cases, the UN IGME estimates are close to the underlying "
"data. The UN IGME aims to minimize the errors for each estimate, harmonize "
"trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly assessed estimates. The "
"UN IGME produces neonatal mortality rate estimates with a Bayesian spline "
"regression model which models the ratio of neonatal mortality rate / (under-"
"five mortality rate - neonatal mortality rate). Estimates of NMR are "
"obtained by recombining the estimates of the ratio with the UN IGME-"
"estimated under-five mortality rate. See the references for details. </p>\n"
"<p>For the underlying data mentioned above, the most frequently used methods "
"are as follows:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li><strong><em>Civil registration</em></strong>: Number of children who "
"died during the first 28 days of life and the number of births used to "
"calculate neonatal mortality rates.</li>\n"
"  <li><strong><em>Censuses and surveys</em></strong>: Censuses and surveys "
"often include questions on household deaths in the last 12 months, which can "
"be used to calculate mortality estimates.</li>\n"
"  <li><strong><em>Surveys: </em></strong>A direct method is used based on a "
"full birth history, a series of detailed questions on each child a woman has "
"given birth to during her lifetime. Neonatal, post-neonatal, infant, child "
"and under-five mortality estimates can be derived from the full birth "
"history module.</li>\n"

msgctxt "COMPARABILITY"
msgid ""
"<h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>\n"
"<p>The UN IGME estimates are derived based on national data. Countries often "
"use a single source as their official estimates or apply methods different "
"from the UN IGME methods to derive estimates. The differences between the UN "
"IGME estimates and national official estimates are usually not large if "
"empirical data has good quality.</p>\n"
"<p>Many countries lack a single source of high-quality data covering the "
"last several decades. Data from different sources require different "
"calculation methods and may suffer from different errors, for example random "
"errors in sample surveys or systematic errors due to misreporting. As a "
"result, different surveys often yield widely different estimates of neonatal "
"mortality for a given time period and available data collected by countries "
"are often inconsistent across sources. It is important to analyse, reconcile "
"and evaluate all data sources simultaneously for each country. Each new "
"survey or data point must be examined in the context of all other sources, "
"including previous data. Data suffer from sampling or non-sampling errors "
"(such as misreporting of age and survivor selection bias; underreporting of "
"child deaths is also common). UN IGME assesses the quality of underlying "
"data sources and adjusts data when necessary. Furthermore, the latest data "
"produced by countries often are not current estimates but refer to an "
"earlier reference period. Thus, the UN IGME also projects estimates to a "
"common reference year. In order to reconcile these differences and take "
"better account of the systematic biases associated with the various types of "
"data inputs, the UN IGME has developed an estimation method to fit a "
"smoothed trend curve to a set of observations and to extrapolate that trend "
"to a defined time point. The UN IGME aims to minimize the errors for each "
"estimate, harmonize trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly "
"assessed estimates of child mortality. In the absence of error-free data, "
"there will always be uncertainty around data and estimates. To allow for "
"added comparability, the UN IGME generates such estimates with uncertainty "
"bounds. Applying a consistent methodology also allows for comparisons "
"between countries, despite the varied number and types of data sources. UN "
"IGME applies a common methodology across countries and uses original "
"empirical data from each country but does not report figures produced by "
"individual countries using other methods, which would not be comparable to "
"other country estimates.</p>"
