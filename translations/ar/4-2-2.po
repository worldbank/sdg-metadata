"<h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>\n"
"<h2><strong><strong>Definition:</strong></strong></h2>\n"
"<p>The participation rate in organized learning (one year before the "
"official primary entry age), by sex as defined as the percentage of children "
"in the given age range who participate in one or more organized learning "
"programme, including programmes which offer a combination of education and "
"care. Participation in early childhood and in primary education are both "
"included. The age range will vary by country depending on the official age "
"for entry to primary education.</p>\n"
"<h2><strong><strong>Concepts:</strong></strong></h2>\n"
"<p>An organized learning programme is one which consists of a coherent set "
"or sequence of educational activities designed with the intention of "
"achieving pre-determined learning outcomes or the accomplishment of a "
"specific set of educational tasks. Early childhood and primary education "
"programmes are examples of organized learning programmes. </p>\n"
"<p>Early childhood and primary education are defined in the 2011 revision of "
"the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED 2011). Early "
"childhood education is typically designed with a holistic approach to "
"support children&#x2019;s early cognitive, physical, social and emotional "
"development and to introduce young children to organized instruction outside "
"the family context. Primary education offers learning and educational "
"activities designed to provide students with fundamental skills in reading, "
"writing and mathematics and establish a solid foundation for learning and "
"understanding core areas of knowledge and personal development. It focuses "
"on learning at a basic level of complexity with little, if any, "
"specialisation. </p>\n"
"<p>The official primary entry age is the age at which children are obliged "
"to start primary education according to national legislation or policies. "
"Where more than one age is specified, for example, in different parts of a "
"country, the most common official entry age (i.e. the age at which most "
"children in the country are expected to start primary) is used for the "
"calculation of this indicator at the global level.</p>"

"<h1>Data sources</h1>\n"
"<h2><strong><strong>Description:</strong></strong></h2>\n"
"<p>Administrative data from schools and other centres of organized learning "
"or from household surveys on enrolment by single year of age in early "
"learning programmes; population censuses and surveys for population "
"estimates by single year of age (if using administrative data on enrolment); "
"administrative data from ministries of education on the official entrance "
"age to primary education.</p>\n"
"<h2><strong><strong>Collection process:</strong></strong></h2>\n"
"<p>The UNESCO Institute for Statistics produces time series based on "
"enrolment data reported by Ministries of Education or National Statistical "
"Offices and population estimates produced by the UN Population Division. The "
"enrolment data are gathered through the annual Survey of Formal Education. "
"Countries are asked to report data according to the levels of education "
"defined in the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) to "
"ensure international comparability of resulting indicators.</p>\n"
"<p>The data received are validated using electronic error detection systems "
"that check for arithmetic errors and inconsistencies and trend analysis for "
"implausible results. Queries are taken up with the country representatives "
"reporting the data so that corrections can be made (of errors) or "
"explanations given (of implausible but correct results). During this process "
"countries are also encouraged to provide estimates for missing or incomplete "
"data items.</p>\n"
"<p>In addition, countries also have an opportunity to see and comment on the "
"main indicators the UIS produces in an annual &#x201C;country review&#x201D; "

"<h2><strong><strong>Rationale:</strong></strong></h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator measures children&#x2019;s exposure to organized learning "
"activities in the year prior to the start of primary school. A high value of "
"the indicator shows a high degree of participation in organized learning "
"immediately before the official entrance age to primary education</p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2><strong><strong>Comments and limitations:</strong></strong></h2>\n"
"<p>Participation in learning programmes in the early years is not full time "
"for many children, meaning that exposure to learning environments outside of "
"the home will vary in intensity. The indicator measures the percentage of "
"children who are exposed to organized learning but not the intensity of the "
"programme, which limits the ability to draw conclusions on the extent to "
"which this target is being achieved. More work is needed to ensure that the "
"definition of learning programmes is consistent across various surveys and "
"defined in a manner that is easily understood by survey respondents, ideally "
"with complementary information collected on the amount of time children "
"spend in learning programmes.</p>"

"<h3>Methodology</h3>\n"
"<h2><strong><strong>Computation method:</strong></strong></h2>\n"
"<p>The number of children in the relevant age group who participate in an "
"organized learning programme is expressed as a percentage of the total "
"population in the same age range. The indicator can be calculated both from "
"administrative data and from household surveys. If the former, the number of "
"enrolments in organized learning programmes are reported by schools and the "
"population in the age group one year below the official primary entry age is "
"derived from population estimates. For the calculation of this indicator at "
"the global level, population estimates from the UN Population Division are "
"used. If derived from household surveys, both enrolments and population are "
"collected at the same time.</p>\n"

"levels 0 and 1) aged one year below the official entry age a to primary "

"<h2><strong><strong>Treatment of missing values:</strong></strong></h2>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>The UIS estimates certain key items of data that may be missing or "
"incomplete in order to have publishable estimates at the country level. "
"Where this is not possible the UIS imputes missing values for use only for "
"calculating regional and global aggregates.</p>\n"
"<p>For the purposes of calculating participation rates by age, the UIS may "
"make one or more of the following:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>An adjustment to account for over- or under-reporting, for example:</"
"li>\n"
"  <li> To include enrolments in a type of education &#x2013; such as private "
"education or special education &#x2013; not reported by the country; and/or "
"</li>\n"
"  <li> To include enrolments in a part of the country not reported by the "
"country.</li>\n"
"  <li>An estimate of the number of enrolments in the given age group if the "
"age distribution was not reported by the country</li>\n"
"  <li>A redistribution of enrolments of unknown age (across known ages)</"
"li>\n"
"  <li>An estimate of the population in the official age group for small "
"countries (if neither the UN Population Division nor the country itself can "
"provide estimates of their own).</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>In all cases estimates are based on evidence from the country itself (eg "
"information from the data provider on the size of the missing component, via "
"correspondence, publications or data on the Ministry&#x2019;s or National "
"Statistical Office&#x2019;s Webpage, or via surveys conducted by other "
"organizations) or on data from the country for a previous year. These "
"figures may be published: (i) as observed data if the missing items are "
"found in a national source; (ii) as national estimates if the country is "
"persuaded to produce estimates and submit them in place of missing data; or "
"(iii) as UIS estimates, if the estimates are made by the UIS.</p>\n"
"<p>The age distribution of enrolments is most commonly estimated from the "
"age distribution reported in a previous year. If the country has never "
"reported the age distribution of enrolments, the age distribution reported "
"in another survey, if available, is used (such as Multiple Indicator Cluster "
"Surveys (MICS) or Demographic Health Surveys (DHS)).</p>\n"
"<p>Enrolments of unknown age are redistributed across known ages if they "
"constitute more than 5% of the total enrolments in that level of education. "
"No estimation is made if they are 5% or less.</p>\n"
"<p>Population estimates by age for countries with small population &#x2013; "
"produced only where there are no other suitable estimates available either "
"from UNPD or from the country itself &#x2013; are made only for countries "
"which have reported education data to the UIS and for which population "
"estimates from a reliable source are available in some years.</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li><strong><em>At regional and global levels:</em></strong></li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>Regional and global aggregates are derived from both publishable and "
"imputed national data. Publishable data are the data submitted to the UIS by "
"Member States or the result of an explicit estimation made by the Institute "
"based on pre-determined standards. In both cases, these data are sent to "
"Member States for review before they are considered publishable by the UIS. "
"</p>\n"
"<p>When data are not available for all countries, the UIS imputes national "
"data for the sole purpose of calculating regional averages. These imputed "
"data are not published nor otherwise disseminated. </p>\n"
"<p>Where data are available for a country for both an earlier and a more "
"recent year than the missing year, a simple linear interpolation is made. "
"Where data are only available for an earlier year, the most recent value is "
"used as an estimate. Similarly, where data are only available for a more "
"recent year, the last value is used as an estimate.</p>\n"
"<p>Where the relevant data are not available at all for a country, estimates "
"may be based on another variable which is clearly linked to the item being "
"estimated. For example, enrolments by age may be based on total enrolments.</"

"<p>Where no data are available for the country in any year that can inform "
"the estimate, the unweighted average for the region in which the country "
"lies is used.</p>"
