msgctxt "COMPARABILITY"
msgid ""
"<h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>\n"
"<p>Discrepancies are possible if there are national figures compiled at the "
"health facility level. These would differ from the global figures, which are "
"typically based on survey data collected at the household level.</p>\n"
"<p>In terms of survey data, some survey reports may present a total "
"percentage of births attended by a skilled health professional that does not "
"conform to the SDG definition (e.g., total includes provider that is not "
"considered skilled, such as a community health worker). In that case, the "
"percentage delivered by a physician, nurse, or a midwife are totaled, "
"consulted with the country and included in the global database as the SDG "
"estimate.</p>\n"
"<p>In some countries where the indicator on skilled attendant at birth is "
"not actively reported, birth in a health facility (institutional births) is "
"used as a proxy indicator. This is frequent countries in the Latin America "
"region or in European and Central Asian regions, where the proportion of "
"institutional births is very high. </p>\n"
"<p>Nonetheless, it should be noted that institutional births may "
"underestimate the percentage of births with skilled attendant.</p>"
