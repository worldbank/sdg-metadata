"<h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>\n"
"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>Number of countries that adopt and implement constitutional, statutory "
"and/or policy guarantees for public access to information</p>\n"
"<p>The focus of this indicator is thus on the status of adoption and "
"implementation of constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for "
"public access to information. The definition relates directly to &#x201C;"
"public access to information&#x201D;, which is wider than, but is also very "
"much based upon, the established fundamental freedoms of expression and "
"association. Conversely, these freedoms also both impact on the environment "
"for public access to information. </p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>Conceptually, &#x2018;public access to information&#x2019; refers to "
"&#x201C;the presence of a robust system through which information is made "
"available to citizens and others.&#x201D; Such a system represents a "
"combination of intellectual, physical, and social elements that affect the "
"availability of information to individuals. In other words, in discussing "
"the issue of public access to information, it is important to recognize that "
"any measurement of its practical outworking needs to take into account how "
"individuals perceive the quality of information in the public domain, the "
"nature of the communicative infrastructure in place to facilitate access, "
"and how that information is ultimately utilized by individuals as members of "
"a particular polity. </p>\n"
"<p>In general, then, these are the issues that go into legislation and "
"policy on public access. More specifically, such legislation and policy take "
"the form of Freedom of Information laws (FOI laws) which are aimed at "
"allowing access by the general public to data held by national governments "
"and, increasingly, by private companies whose work intersect with government "
"operations. </p>\n"
"<p>The emergence of freedom of information legislation was a response to "
"increasing dissatisfaction with the secrecy surrounding government policy "
"development and decision making. They establish a &quot;right-to-know&quot; "
"legal process by which requests may be made for government-held information, "
"to be received freely or at minimal cost, barring standard exceptions.</p>\n"
"<p>Such a formulation has a basis in international agreements. For example, "
"the right to freedom of expression, which is not only recognized as a basic "
"human right in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), is also "
"upheld in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966), "
"the European Convention on Human Rights (1950), the American Convention on "
"Human Rights (1969) and the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#x2019; "
"Rights (1981), thus lending itself to universal political recognition and "
"application. More specifically, in the European context, reference may be "
"made to the Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents, "
"adopted on 18 June 2009. In the Americas, the Organization of American "
"States&#x2019; Inter-American Juridical Committee developed a set of "
"Principles on the Right of Access to Information in 2008.</p>"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>As suggested by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and "
"UNESCO in earlier presentations to the UN Technical Support Team (UN TST), "
"this is a relevant and measurable indicator. </p>\n"
"<p>It also responds to the growing number of UN member states that have "
"already adopted legal guarantees, and many others that are currently "
"considering relevant legislation or regulation in the field.</p>\n"
"<p>The rationale for assessing the implementation dimension is to assess the "
"relevance of legal steps to practical information accessibility. It is not a "
"composite indicator, but a logical linkage of laws and policies to practical "
"impact that is relevant to SDG concerns.</p>\n"
"<p>For this indicator, the operative words are &#x201C;adoption&#x201D; and "
"&#x201C;implementation&#x201D;. As such, it establishes: (a) whether a "
"country (or at the global level, the number of countries) has "
"constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to "
"information; (b) the extent to which such national guarantees reflect "
"&#x2018;international agreements&#x2019; (e.g. Universal Declaration of "
"Human Rights, etc.); and (c) the implementation mechanisms in place for such "
"guarantees, including the following variables:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>Government efforts to publicly promote the right to information.</li>\n"
"  <li>Citizens&#x2019; awareness of their legal right to information and "
"their ability to utilize it effectively.</li>\n"
"  <li>The capacity of public bodies to provide information upon request by "
"the public. </li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>This indicator thus collates data from multiple sources, including "
"National Human Rights Institutions, national and international non-"
"governmental organizations, academic institutions, and national media "
"regulatory authorities, among others. Such information will be gathered, "
"processed and checked by international organizations - UNESCO and World Bank."
"</p>\n"
"<p>UNESCO collects some aspects of this data using the Media Development "
"Indicators, in addition to the biennial World Trends in Freedom of "
"Expression and Media Development report. </p>\n"
"<p>Data on the existence of freedom of information laws are available for at "
"least 195 countries.</p>"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>The method of computation is both quantitative and qualitative, with data "
"generated from a global review of existing surveys (e.g. UNESCO&apos;s World "
"Trends in Freedom of Expression &amp; Media Development reports, etc.), "
"administrative records, expert assessments (e.g. World Justice Open "
"Government Index), etc. More specifically, the following key variables will "
"be assessed: </p>\n"
"<ol>\n"
"  <li>Does a country have constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees "
"for public access to information?</li>\n"
"  <li>Do those constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees reflect "
"known international agreements (e.g. the Universal Declaration of Human "
"Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, etc.)?</"
"li>\n"
"  <li>What implementation mechanisms are in place to ensure that such "
"guarantees work optimally?</li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"<p>To address these questions, the following will serve as performance sub-"
"indicators:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>National law or constitutional guarantee on the right to information</"
"li>\n"
"  <li>Country has signed and ratified relevant treaty obligations, with no "
"significant exemptions, and these are reflected, to the extent possible, in "
"domestic FOI legislation</li>\n"
"  <li>Public is aware of and exercises right to access official information</"
"li>\n"
"  <li>Public bodies release information both pro-actively and on demand</"
"li>\n"
"  <li>Effective and efficient appeals mechanism via independent "
"administrative body e.g. information commissioner or ombudsman</li>\n"
"  <li>Any restriction on grounds of protection of personal privacy is "
"narrowly defined so as to exclude information in which there is no "
"justifiable public interest. </li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>The means of verification will include:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>Any law or policy on right to information that accords with "
"international standards</li>\n"
"  <li>Reports from credible agencies/experts about right to information "
"guarantees and the extent to which they reflect international standards/"
"agreements</li>\n"
"  <li>Policies of public bodies concerning release of information (which "
"ensure readily, freely available public access to information, including "
"online)</li>\n"
"  <li>Evidence of state commitment to open government e.g. publication and "
"dissemination of laws, court decisions, parliamentary proceedings, spending "
"programmes (vis-&#xE0;-vis SDG undertakings)</li>\n"
"  <li>Statistical information about public requests for official information "

"<h2>Disaggregation:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator can be disaggregated in terms of the extent to which the "
"residence of citizens affects their ability to access information (e.g. how "
"do rural, peri-rural, urban and peri-urban dwellers access information from "
"public bodies). It can also be disaggregated in terms of whether gender "
"influences ability to access information. Furthermore, aspects of how "
"disability affects public access to information can also be assessed.</p>"
