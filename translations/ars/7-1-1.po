"<p>SDG7 ensures access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern "
"energy for all. Specifically, Indicator 7.1.1 refers to the proportion of "
"population with access to electricity. This is expressed in percentage "
"figures and is disaggregated by total, urban and rural access rates per "
"country, as well as by UN regional and global classifications. </p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>Electricity access in this scenario refers to the proportion of "
"population in the considered area (country, region or global context) that "
"has access to consistent sources of electricity.</p>\n"

"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>Data for access to electricity is collected from household surveys and "

"including: Multi-tier Framework (MTF), Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) "
"and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS), Multi-Indicator Cluster "
"Surveys (MICS), the World Health Survey (WHS), other nationally developed "
"and implemented surveys, including those by various government agencies (for "
"example, ministries of energy and utilities).</p>\n"
"<p>The World Bank is the agency that has taken responsibility for compiling "
"a meta-database of statistics on electricity access harvested from the full "
"global body of household surveys. The World Bank Electrification Database "
"covers more than 220 countries for the period 1990-2018 and is updated "
"regularly.</p>\n"
"<p>For more information on compiling access to energy data see Global "
"Tracking Framework report (2013) (Chapter 2, Annex 2, page 127-129).</p>\n"
"<p>Reports produced by international agencies such as the UN, World Bank, "
"USAID, National Statistics Offices, as well as country censuses are used to "

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Access to electricity addresses major critical issues in all the "
"dimensions of sustainable development. The target has a wide range of social "
"and economic impacts, including facilitating development of income "
"generating activities and lightening the burden of household tasks.</p>\n"
"<p>Under the global target of equal access to energy, SDG7.1.1 focuses "
"specifically on electricity access available to the global population. In "
"order to gain a clear picture, access rates are only considered if the "
"primary source of lighting is the local electricity provider, solar systems, "
"mini-grids and stand-alone systems. Sources such as generators, candles, "
"batteries, etc., are not considered due to their limited working capacities "
"and since they are usually kept as backup sources for lighting.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>The World Bank aims to estimate demand side access rates in order to "
"better understand the access levels experienced by the population. This is "
"different from the supply side access rates usually provided by governments, "
"ministries, etc. The data collected is compiled from national household "
"surveys and censuses. But since these are carried out infrequently, it is "
"difficult to understand the ground level trends for short term periods. "
"Collecting data for rural areas as well as last-mile connectivity problems "
"also cause errors in data collection that could skew results. </p>\n"
"<p>While the existing global household survey evidence base provides a good "
"starting point for tracking household energy access, it also presents "
"several limitations that will need to be addressed over time. In many parts "
"of the world, the presence of an electricity connection in the household "
"does not necessarily guarantee that the energy supplied is adequate in "
"quality and reliability or affordable in cost and it would be desirable to "
"have fuller information about these critical attributes of the service, "
"which have been highlighted in SDG7.</p>\n"
"<p>Substantial progress has already been made toward developing and piloting "
"a new methodology known as the Multi-Tier Framework for Measuring Energy "
"Access (World Bank) which is able to capture these broader dimensions of "
"service quality and would make it possible to go beyond a simple yes/no "
"measure of energy access to a more refined approach that recognizes "
"different levels of energy access, and also takes into account the "
"affordability and reliability of energy access explicitly referenced in the "
"language of SDG7. The methodology for the Multi-Tier Framework for Measuring "
"Energy Access has already been published based on a broad consultative "
"exercise and represents a consensus view across numerous international "
"agencies working in the field. Discussions are also progressing with the "
"World Bank&#x2019;s Household Survey Technical Working Group regarding the "
"mainstreaming of this methodology into the standardized household "
"questionnaire design that will be applied every three years in all low-"
"income countries between 2015 and 2030 as part of the broader SDG monitoring "
"exercise.</p>\n"
"<p>The adoption of this methodology will allow &#x2013; over time &#x2013; "
"the more refined measurement of energy access, making it possible to report "
"more disaggregated information regarding the type of electricity supply "
"(grid or off-grid), the capacity of electricity supply provided (in Watts), "
"the duration of service (daily hours and evening hours), the reliability of "
"service (in terms of number and length of unplanned service interruptions), "
"the quality of service (in terms of voltage fluctuations), as well as "
"affordability and legality of service.</p>\n"
"<p>Another advantage of this approach is that they can be applied not only "
"to measuring energy access at the household level, but also its availability "
"to support enterprises and deliver critical community services, such as "
"health and education.</p>\n"
"<p>Methodological challenges associated with the measurement of energy "
"access are more fully described the Global Tracking Framework (2013) "
"(Chapter 2, Section 1, page 75-82), and in the ESMAP (2015) Report &#x201C;"

"<p>To estimate values, a multilevel nonparametric modelling approach&#x2014;"
"developed by the World Health Organization to estimate clean fuel "
"usage&#x2014;was adapted to&#xA0;predict&#xA0;electricity access and used to "
"fill in the missing data points for the time period between 1990 and 2018. "
"Where data&#xA0;is&#xA0;available, access estimates are weighted by "
"population. Multilevel nonparametric modelling&#xA0;considers&#xA0;the "
"hierarchical structure of data (country and regional levels), using the "
"regional classification of the United Nations.&#xA0;</p>\n"
"<p>The model is applied for all countries with at least one data point. In "
"order to use as much real data as possible, results based on real survey "
"data are reported in their original form for all years available. The "
"statistical model is used to fill in data only for years where they are "
"missing and to conduct global and regional analyses. In the absence of "
"survey data for a given year, information from regional trends was borrowed. "
"The difference between real data points and estimated values is clearly "
"identified in the database.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n"
"<p>Countries considered &#x201C;Developed&#x201D; by the United Nations and "
"classified as &#x201C;High Income&#x201D; are assumed to have "
"electrification rates of 100 percent from the first year the country joined "
"the category.&#xA0;</p>\n"
"<p>In the present report, to avoid having electrification trends from 1990 "
"to 2010 overshadow electrification efforts since 2010, the model was run "
"twice:&#xA0;</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>With survey data + assumptions from 1990&#x2013;2018 for model "
"estimates from 1990&#x2013;2018&#xA0;</li>\n"
"  <li>With survey data + assumptions from 2010&#x2013;2018 for model "
"estimates from 2010&#x2013;2018&#xA0;</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>Given the low frequency and the regional distribution of some surveys, "
"several countries have gaps in available data. To develop the historical "
"evolution and starting point of electrification rates, a simple modelling "
"approach was adopted to fill in the missing data points. This modelling "
"approach allowed the estimation of electrification rates for 212 countries "
"over these time periods. The SE4ALL Global Tracking Framework Report (2013) "
