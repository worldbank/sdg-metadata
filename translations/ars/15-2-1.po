"<h2>Definition: </h2>\n"
"<p>&#x201C;Sustainable forest management&#x201D; (SFM) is a central concept "
"for Goal 15 and target 15.1 as well as for target 15.2. It has been formally "
"defined, by the UN General Assembly, as follows: </p>\n"
"<p><em>[a] dynamic and evolving concept [that] aims to maintain and enhance "
"the economic, social and environmental values of all types of forests, for "
"the benefit of present and future generations</em>&#x201D; (Resolution A/"
"RES/62/98) </p>\n"
"<p>The indicator is composed of five sub-indicators that measure progress "
"towards all dimensions of sustainable forest management. The environmental "
"values of forests are covered by three sub-indicators focused on the "
"extension of forest area, biomass within the forest area and protection and "
"maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural "
"resources. Social and economic values of forests are reconciled with "
"environmental values through sustainable management plans. The sub-indicator "
"provides further qualification to the management of forest areas, by "
"assessing areas which are independently verified for compliance with a set "
"of national or international standards. </p>\n"
"<p>The sub-indicators are: </p>\n"
"<ol>\n"
"  <li>Forest area annual net change rate </li>\n"
"  <li>Above-ground biomass stock in forest </li>\n"
"  <li>Proportion of forest area located within legally established protect "
"areas </li>\n"
"  <li>Proportion of forest area under a long term forest management plan </"
"li>\n"
"  <li>Forest area under an independently verified forest management "
"certification scheme </li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"<p>A dashboard is used to assess progress related to the five sub-"
"indicators. The adoption of the dashboard approach aims at ensuring "
"consideration of all dimensions of sustainable forest management and "
"provides for clear view of areas where progress has been achieved. </p>\n"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale: </h2>\n"
"<p>The definition of SFM by the UN General Assembly contains several key "
"aspects, notably that sustainable forest management is a concept which "
"varies over time and between countries, whose circumstances &#x2013; "
"ecological, social and economic &#x2013; vary widely, but that it should "
"always address a wide range of forest values, including economic, social and "
"environmental values, and take intergenerational equity into account. </p>\n"
"<p>Clearly a simple measure of forest area is insufficient to monitor "
"sustainable forest management as a whole. The significance of the five sub-"
"indicators can be briefly explained as follows: </p>\n"
"<ol>\n"
"  <li>Trends in forest area are crucial for monitoring SFM. The first sub-"
"indicator focuses on both the direction of change (whether there is a loss "
"or gain in forest area) and how the change rate is changing over time; the "
"latter is important in order to capture progress among countries that are "
"losing forest area, but have managed to reduce the rate of annual forest "
"area loss. </li>\n"
"  <li>Changes in the above-ground biomass stock in forest indicate the "
"balance between gains in biomass stock due to forest growth and losses due "
"to wood removals, natural losses, fire, wind, pests and diseases. At country "
"level and over a longer period, sustainable forest management would imply a "
"stable or increasing biomass stock per hectare, while a long-term reduction "
"of biomass stock per hectare would imply either unsustainable management of "
"the forests and degradation or unexpected major losses due to fire, wind, "
"pests or diseases. </li>\n"
"  <li>The change in forest area within legally protected areas is a proxy "
"for trends in conservation of forest biodiversity as well as cultural and "
"spiritual values of forests and thus a clear indication of the political "
"will to protect and conserve forests. This indicator is related to the CBD "
"Aichi Target 11 which calls for each country to conserve at least 17 per "
"cent of terrestrial and inland water areas. </li>\n"
"  <li>The fourth sub-indicator looks at the forest area that is under a long "
"term forest management plan. The existence of a documented forest management "
"plan is the basis for long term and sustainable management of the forest "
"resources for a variety of management objectives such as for wood and non-"
"wood forest products, protection of soil and water, biodiversity "
"conservation, social and cultural use, and a combination of two or several "
"of these. An increasing area under forest management plan is therefore an "
"indicator of progress towards sustainable forest management. </li>\n"
"  <li>The fifth sub-indicator is the forest area that is certified by an "
"independently verified forest management certification scheme. Such "
"certification schemes apply standards that generally are higher than those "
"established by the countries&#x2019; own normative frameworks, and "
"compliance is verified by an independent and accredited certifier. An "
"increase in certified forest area therefore provides an additional "
"indication of progress towards sustainable forest management. It should "
"however be noted that there are significant areas of sustainably managed "
"forest which are not certified, either because their owners have chosen not "
"to seek certification (which is voluntary and market-based) or because no "
"credible or affordable certification scheme is in place for that area. </"

"<h2>Comments and limitations: </h2>\n"
"<p>The five sub-indicators chosen to illustrate progress towards sustainable "
"forest management do not fully cover all aspects of sustainable forest "
"management. In particular, social and economic aspects are summarized under "
"the sub-indicators on areas under sustainable forest management plans. "
"Furthermore, as the trends are calculated using only those countries which "
"have data complete time series, different sub-indicators may reflect "
"different sets of countries. </p>\n"

"indicators, there is no weighting of the relative importance of the sub-"
"indicators. </p>"

"<h1>Methodology </h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method: </h2>\n"
"<p>National data on forest area, biomass stock, forest area within protected "
"areas, and forest area under management plan are reported directly by "
"countries to FAO for pre-established reference years. Based on the country "
"reported data, FAO then makes country-level estimates of the forest area net "
"change rate using the compound interest formula. The proportion of forest "
"area within protected area and under management plan is calculated using the "
"reported areas and the official FAOSTAT land area for reference year 2015. "
"Data on forest area under an independently verified forest management "
"certification scheme are reported to FAO by the head offices of respective "
"forest certification scheme, who are jointly adjusting the figures to remove "
"any double accounting. </p>\n"

"<p>The national figures in the database are reported by the countries "

"thus eliminating any discrepancies between global and national figures. The "
"reporting template requests that countries provide the full reference for "
"original data sources as well as national definitions and terminology. "
"Separate sections in the template (country reports) deal with the analysis "
"of data (including any assumptions made and the methods used for estimates "
"and projections to the common reporting years); calibration of data to the "
"official land area as held by FAO; and reclassification of data to the "
"classes used in FAO&#x2019;s Global Forest Resources Assessments. </p>\n"
"<p>Regarding the data on forest area under an independently verified forest "
"management certification scheme, these are usually not part of official "
"national statistics, and are maintained by local offices of the respective "
"certification schemes. They in turn report their data to their head offices. "
"As certified forest area is dynamic and can change monthly as some "
"certificates expire and new certificates come. </p>\n"
"<p>Therefore, the data are requested to correspond to the end of June each "
"year. However, data are not always reported by the local offices according "

"<p><strong><em>FOREST</em></strong></p>\n"
"<p>Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and "
"a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these "
"thresholds <em>in situ</em>. It does not include land that is predominantly "
"under agricultural or urban land use<strong>. </strong></p>\n"
"<p><u>Explanatory notes</u></p>\n"
"<ol>\n"
"  <li>Forest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of "
"other predominant land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum "
"height of 5 meters. </li>\n"
"  <li>Includes areas with young trees that have not yet reached but which "
"are expected to reach a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height "
"of 5 meters or more. It also includes areas that are temporarily unstocked "
"due to clear-cutting as part of a forest management practice or natural "
"disasters, and which are expected to be regenerated within 5 years. Local "
"conditions may, in exceptional cases, justify that a longer time frame is "
"used.</li>\n"
"  <li>Includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest "
"in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those "
"of specific environmental, scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual "
"interest.</li>\n"
"  <li>Includes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area "
"of more than 0.5 hectares and width of more than 20 meters.</li>\n"
"  <li>Includes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of "
"trees that have, or are expected to reach, a canopy cover of at least 10 "
"percent and tree height of at least 5 meters.</li>\n"
"  <li>Includes areas with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless whether this "
"area is classified as land area or not.</li>\n"
"  <li>Includes rubberwood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations. </li>\n"
"  <li>Includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height "
"and canopy cover criteria are met.</li>\n"
"  <li><u>Excludes</u> tree stands in agricultural production systems, such "
"as fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive orchards and "
"agroforestry systems when crops are grown under tree cover. <u>Note:</u> "
"Some agroforestry systems such as the &#x201C;Taungya&#x201D; system where "
"crops are grown only during the first years of the forest rotation should be "
"classified as forest.</li>\n"

"<p>Using forest area in 2015 as denominator for estimating this indicator "
"ensures that the time series of percentages reflect real changes in the "

"(losses or gains) in total forest area. </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Sub-indicator 5 &#x2013; Forest area under an independently "

"<p><u>Unit</u>: Thousand hectares</p>\n"
"<p><u>Reference year:</u> Latest reporting year (as of June 30)</p>\n"
"<p><u>Method of estimation:</u> Data is collected directly from the "
"databases of each certification scheme and provided to countries for "
"validation.</p>\n"
"<p><u>Translation to dashboard/traffic light: </u>The indicator value for "
"latest reporting year is compared with the indicator value for previous "

"<p>The ratio (r) between the current indicator value and the previously "
"reported value is calculated; r&gt;1 means an increase in areas under an "
"independent forest management certification scheme, r&lt;1 means a decrease "
