"<p>This indicator is linked to Target 3.8 (Achieve universal health "
"coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential "
"health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable "
"essential medicines and vaccines for all) because the provision of family "
"planning information and methods to all individuals who want to prevent "
"pregnancy is an important component of achieving universal health coverage. "
"</p>\n"
"<p>This indicator is also linked to Target 5.6 (Ensure universal access to "
"sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights as agreed in "
"accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on "
"Population and Development and the Beijing Platform for Action and the "
"outcome documents of their review conferences) because meeting the demand "
"for family planning is facilitated by increasing access to sexual and "
"reproductive health-care services, and also improves sexual and reproductive "
"health and the ability to exercise reproductive rights. </p>"

"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>The percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who desire "
"either to have no (additional) children or to postpone the next child and "
"who are currently using a modern method of contraception. The indicator is "
"also referred to as the demand for family planning satisfied with modern "
"methods.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>The percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who have their "
"need for family planning satisfied with modern methods is also referred to "
"as the proportion of demand satisfied by modern methods. The components of "
"the indicator are contraceptive prevalence (any method and modern methods) "
"and unmet need for family planning. </p>\n"
"<p>Contraceptive prevalence is the percentage of women who are currently "
"using, or whose partner is currently using, at least one method of "
"contraception, regardless of the method used. </p>\n"
"<p>For analytical purposes, contraceptive methods are often classified as "
"either modern or traditional. Modern methods of contraception include female "
"and male sterilization, the intra-uterine device (IUD), the implant, "
"injectables, oral contraceptive pills, male and female condoms, vaginal "
"barrier methods (including the diaphragm, cervical cap and spermicidal foam, "
"jelly, cream and sponge), lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), emergency "
"contraception and other modern methods not reported separately (e.g., the "
"contraceptive patch or vaginal ring). Traditional methods of contraception "
"include rhythm (e.g., fertility awareness-based methods, periodic "
"abstinence), withdrawal and other traditional methods not reported "
"separately.</p>\n"
"<p>Unmet need for family planning is defined as the percentage of women of "
"reproductive age, either married or in a union, who want to stop or delay "
"childbearing but are not using any method of contraception. The standard "
"definition of unmet need for family planning includes women who are fecund "
"and sexually active in the numerator, and who report not wanting any (more) "
"children, or who report wanting to delay the birth of their next child for "
"at least two years or are undecided about the timing of the next birth, but "
"who are not using any method of contraception. The numerator also includes "
"pregnant women whose pregnancies were unwanted or mistimed at the time of "
"conception; and postpartum amenorrheic women who are not using family "
"planning and whose last birth was unwanted or mistimed. Further information "
"on the operational definition of the unmet need for family planning, as well "
"as survey questions and statistical programs needed to derive the indicator, "
"can be found at the following website: <a href=\"http://measuredhs.com/"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The proportion of demand for family planning satisfied with modern "
"methods is useful in assessing overall levels of coverage for family "
"planning programmes and services. Access to and use of an effective means to "
"prevent pregnancy helps enable women and their partners to exercise their "
"rights to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their "
"children and to have the information, education and means to do so. Meeting "
"demand for family planning with modern methods also contributes to maternal "
"and child health by preventing unintended pregnancies and closely spaced "
"pregnancies, which are at higher risk for poor obstetrical outcomes. Levels "
"of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods of 75 per cent "
"or more are generally considered high, and values of 50 per cent or less are "
"generally considered as very low.</p>"

"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>Differences in the survey design and implementation, as well as "
"differences in the way survey questionnaires are formulated and administered "
"can affect the comparability of the data. The most common differences relate "
"to the range of contraceptive methods included and the characteristics (age, "
"sex, marital or union status) of the persons for whom contraceptive "
"prevalence is estimated (base population). The time frame used to assess "
"contraceptive prevalence can also vary. In most surveys there is no "
"definition of what is meant by &#x201C;currently using&#x201D; a method of "
"contraception.</p>\n"
"<p>In some surveys, the lack of probing questions, asked to ensure that the "
"respondent understands the meaning of the different contraceptive methods, "
"can result in an underestimation of contraceptive prevalence, in particular "
"for traditional methods. Sampling variability can also be an issue, "
"especially when contraceptive prevalence is measured for a specific subgroup "
"(by age-group, level of educational attainment, place of residence, etc.) or "
"when analysing trends over time.</p>\n"
"<p>When data on women aged 15 to 49 are not available, information for "
"married or in-union women is reported. Illustrations of base populations "
"that are sometimes presented are: married or in-union women aged 15-44, "
"sexually active women (irrespective of marital status), or ever-married "
"women. Notes in the data set indicate any differences between the data "
"presented and the standard definitions of contraceptive prevalence or unmet "
"need for family planning or where data pertain to populations that are not "
"representative of women of reproductive age.</p>"
