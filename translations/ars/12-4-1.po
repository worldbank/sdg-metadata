"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Parties:</em></strong> Countries that have ratified, "
"accepted, approved or accessed a convention.</p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Information:</em></strong> Parties to the Basel Convention "
"have an obligation to present an annual national report as provided for by "
"Article 13, paragraph 3 in order to enable monitoring of the implementation "
"of the Basel Convention by its Parties. The reports are to contain, inter "
"alia, Information regarding transboundary movements of hazardous wastes or "
"other wastes in which Parties have been involved, including the amount of "
"hazardous wastes and other wastes exported, their category, characteristics, "
"destination, any transit country and disposal method as stated on the "
"response to notification, the amount of hazardous wastes and other wastes "
"imported their category, characteristics, origin, and disposal methods; "
"information on accidents occurring during the transboundary movement and "
"disposal of hazardous wastes and other wastes and on the measures undertaken "
"to deal with them; information on disposal options operated within the area "
"of their national jurisdiction; and other information as per reporting "
"format.</p>\n"
"<p>Import responses under the Rotterdam Convention are the decisions "
"provided by Parties indicating whether or not they will consent to import "
"the chemicals listed in Annex III of the Convention and subject to the prior "
"informed consent (PIC) procedure. Article 10 of the Rotterdam Convention "
"sets out the obligations of Parties with respect to the future import of "
"chemicals listed in Annex III.</p>\n"
"<p>Under the Stockholm Convention a Party has an obligation to report on the "
"measures it has taken to implement the provisions of the Convention and on "
"the effectiveness of such measures in meeting the objectives of the "
"Convention. The national reports include statistical data on the total "
"quantities of production, import and export of each of the chemicals listed "
"in Annex A and Annex B or a reasonable estimate of such data; and to the "
"extent practicable, a list of the States from which it has imported each "
"such substance and the States to which it has exported each such substance. "
"A National Implementation Plan under the Stockholm Convention is a plan "
"explaining how a Party is going to implement the obligations under the "
"Convention and make efforts to put such a plan into operation (<a href="

"a>). Changes in the obligations arising from amendments to the Convention or "
"its annexes, for example when a new chemical is listed into the annexes of "
"the Convention, a Party will review and update its implementation plan, and "
"transmit the updated plan to the Conference of the Parties within two years "
"of the entry into force of the amendment for it, consistent with paragraph 1 "
"(b) of the Convention (according to paragraph 7 of the annex to decision "
"SC-1/12). </p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" "

"only needs to be communicated to the Secretariat based on national "
"circumstances, such  as a possible national definitions of hazardous wastes, "
"possible article 11 agreements under the Basel Convention, or a possible "
"exemptions under the Stockholm Convention would not be included, either "
"because the Secretariat is not in a position to assess whether the "
"obligation to transmit information has materialized itself, or because "
