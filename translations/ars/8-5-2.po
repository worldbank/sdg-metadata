"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>The unemployment rate conveys the percentage of persons in the labour "
"force who are unemployed.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>Unemployed persons are defined as all those of working age (usually aged "
"15 and above) who were not in employment, carried out activities to seek "
"employment during a specified recent period and were currently available to "
"take up employment given a job opportunity, where: (a) &#x201C;not in "
"employment&#x201D; is assessed with respect to the short reference period "
"for the measurement of employment; (b) to &#x201C;seek employment&#x201D; "
"refers to any activity when carried out, during a specified recent period "
"comprising the last four weeks or one month, for the purpose of finding a "
"job or setting up a business or agricultural undertaking; (c) the point when "
"the enterprise starts to exist should be used to distinguish between search "
"activities aimed at setting up a business and the work activity itself, as "
"evidenced by the enterprise&#x2019;s registration to operate or by when "
"financial resources become available, the necessary infrastructure or "
"materials are in place or the first client or order is received, depending "
"on the context; (d) &#x201C;currently available&#x201D; serves as a test of "
"readiness to start a job in the present, assessed with respect to a short "
"reference period comprising that used to measure employment (depending on "
"national circumstances, the reference period may be extended to include a "
"short subsequent period not exceeding two weeks in total, so as to ensure "
"adequate coverage of unemployment situations among different population "
"groups). </p>\n"
"<p>Persons in employment are defined as all those of working age (usually "
"aged 15 and above) who, during a short reference period such as one week or "
"one day, were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services "
"for pay or profit.</p>\n"
"<p>The labour force corresponds to the sum of persons in employment and in "
"unemployment</p>\n"

"survey, a population census and/or other type of household surveys with an "
"appropriate employment module may also be used to obtain the required data. "
"</p>\n"
"<p>It is important to note that unemployment data derived from employment "
"office records or unemployment registers would not refer to unemployment (as "
"defined for the purposes of this indicator, using the three-criteria of "
"being without a job, seeking employment and available for employment) but to "
"registered unemployment, and thus, it would not be comparable with indicator "

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The unemployment rate is a useful measure of the underutilization of the "
"labour supply. It reflects the inability of an economy to generate "
"employment for those persons who want to work but are not doing so, even "
"though they are available for employment and actively seeking work. It is "
"thus seen as an indicator of the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy "
"to absorb its labour force and of the performance of the labour market. "
"Short-term time series of the unemployment rate can be used to signal "
"changes in the business cycle; upward movements in the indicator often "
"coincide with recessionary periods or in some cases with the beginning of an "
"expansionary period as persons previously not in the labour market begin to "
"test conditions through an active job search.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>Even though in most developed countries the unemployment rate is useful "
"as an indicator of labour market performance, and specifically, as a key "
"measure of labour underutilization, in many developing countries, the "
"significance and meaning of the unemployment rate could be questioned. In "
"the absence of unemployment insurance systems or social safety nets, persons "
"of working age must avoid unemployment, resorting to engaging in some form "
"of economic activity, however insignificant or inadequate. Thus, in this "
"context, other measures should supplement the unemployment rate to "
"comprehensively assess labour underutilization.</p>"

"<h2>Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the "

"data is collected at the national level mainly through labour force surveys "
"(or other types of household surveys with an employment module). For the "
