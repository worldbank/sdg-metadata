msgctxt "SOURCE_TYPE"

"<h1>Data sources</h1>\n"
"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>To provide a full picture of international support to statistics, the "
"indicator draws on three distinct data sources. The first source of data is "
"the OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS), which records data from OECD "
"Development Assistance Committee (DAC) members and some non-DAC donors, and "
"provides a comprehensive accounting of ODA. Donors report specific codes for "
"the sector targeted by their aid activity. Statistical capacity building "
"(SCB) is designated by code 16062. </p>\n"
"<p>Second, when SCB is a component of a larger project, it is not identified "
"by this code, causing the CRS figures to underestimate actual levels of "
"support for international aid. PARIS21 seeks to reduce this downward bias by "
"searching project descriptions in the CRS for terms indicating a component "
"of SCB. The methodology is presented at <a href=\"http://www.paris21.org/"
"PRESS2015\">http://www.paris21.org/PRESS2015</a>.</p>\n"
"<p>Third, and finally, the PARIS21 Secretariat supplements this data with an "
"online questionnaire completed by a global network of reporters. The "
"questionnaire covers a subset of the variables collected in the CRS and some "
"additional variables specific to statistical capacity building. Reporting to "
"the questionnaire is voluntary, offering an opportunity for actors to share "
"information on their statistical activities. Reporters to this questionnaire "
"are countries that do not report to the CRS, as well as multilateral "
"institutions with large portfolios of statistical projects that have "
"requested to report to the PARIS21 Secretariat directly.</p>\n"

msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>Measuring support to statistics comes with many methodological "
"challenges. The financial figures presented in the PRESS therefore need to "
"be interpreted with these challenges in mind. For instance, PRESS numbers "
"rely on the Creditor Reporting System (CRS) for ODA commitments supplemented "
"by voluntary reporting from additional donors. Yet, full coverage of all "
"programs cannot be guaranteed. Furthermore, the reported commitments can be "
"seen as an upper bound to the actual support to statistics for mainly three "
"reasons. First, double counting of projects may occur when the donor and "
"project implementer report on the same project or when all project co-"
"financers report project totals. Second, the reported numbers may be "
"inflated by working with project totals for multi-sector projects, which "
"comprise only a small statistics component. Finally, the PRESS reports on "
"donor-side commitments which do not always translate to actual disbursements "
"to the recipient countries.</p>\n"

"not account for domestic resources.</p>"
