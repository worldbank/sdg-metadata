"<h2>Definition:<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-ref-1\">[1]</"
"a></sup></sup></h2>\n"
"<p><strong>Small-scale industrial enterprises</strong>, in the SDG framework "
"also called &#x201C;<strong>small-scale industries</strong>&#x201D;, defined "
"here for the purpose of statistical data collection and compilation refer to "
"statistical units, generally enterprises, engaged in production of goods and "
"services for market below a designated size class.</p>\n"
"<p>This indicator shows the number of &#x201C;small-scale industries&#x201D; "
"with an active line of credit or a loan from a financial institution in the "
"reference year in percentage to the total number of such enterprises.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>International recommendations for industrial statistics 2008 (IRIS 2008) "
"(United Nations, 2011) define an <strong>enterprise</strong> as the smallest "
"legal unit that constitutes an organizational unit producing goods or "
"services. The enterprise is the basic statistical unit at which all "
"information relating to its production activities and transactions, "
"including financial and balance-sheet accounts, are maintained. It is also "
"used for institutional sector classification in the 2008 System of National "
"Accounts.</p>\n"
"<p>An <strong>establishment</strong> is defined as an enterprise or part of "
"an enterprise that is situated in a single location and in which only a "
"single productive activity is carried out or in which the principal "
"productive activity accounts for most of the value added. An establishment "
"can be defined ideally as an economic unit that engages, under single "
"ownership or control, that is, under a single legal entity, in one, or "
"predominantly one, kind of economic activity at a single physical location. "
"Mines, factories and workshops are examples. This ideal concept of an "
"establishment is applicable to many of the situations encountered in "
"industrial inquiries, particularly in manufacturing.</p>\n"
"<p>Although the definition of an establishment allows for the possibility "
"that there may be one or more secondary activities carried out in it, their "
"magnitude should be small compared with that of the principal activity. If a "
"secondary activity within an establishment is as important, or nearly as "
"important, as the principal activity, then the unit is more like a local "
"unit. It should be subdivided so that the secondary activity is treated as "
"taking place within an establishment separate from the establishment in "
"which the principal activity takes place.</p>\n"
"<p>In the case of most <strong>small-sized businesses</strong>, the "
"enterprise and the establishment will be identical. Some enterprises are "
"large and complex with different kinds of economic activities undertaken at "
"different locations. Such enterprises should be broken down into one or more "
"establishments, provided that smaller and more homogeneous production units "
"can be identified for which production data may be meaningfully compiled. </"
"p>\n"
"<p>As introduced in IRIS 2008 (United Nations, 2011), an <strong>economic "
"activity</strong> is understood as referring to a process, that is to say, "
"to the combination of actions carried out by a certain entity that uses "
"labor, capital, goods and services to produce specific products (goods and "
"services). In general, industrial statistics reflect the characteristics and "
"economic activities of units engaged in a class of industrial activities "
"that are defined in terms of the International Standard Industrial "
"Classification of All Economic Activities, Revision 4 (ISIC Rev.4) (United "
"Nations, 2008) or International Standard Industrial Classification of All "
"Economic Activities, Revision 3.1 (ISIC Rev. 3) (United Nations, 2002).</p>\n"
"<p><strong>Total numbers of persons employed</strong> is defined as the "
"total number of persons who work in or for the statistical unit, whether "
"full-time or part-time, including:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>Working proprietors</li>\n"
"  <li>Active business partners</li>\n"
"  <li>Unpaid family workers</li>\n"
"  <li>Paid employees (for more details see United Nations, 2011).</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>The size of a statistical unit based on employment should be defined "
"primarily in terms of the average number of persons employed in that unit "
"during the reference period. If the average number of persons employed is "
"not available, the total number of persons employed in a single period may "
"be used as the size criterion. The size classification should consist of the "
"following classes of the average number of persons employed: 1-9, 10-19, "
"20-49, 50-249, 250 and more. This should be considered a minimum division of "
"the overall range; more detailed classifications, where required, should be "
"developed within this framework.</p>\n"
"<p>A <strong>loan</strong> is a financial instrument that is created when a "
"creditor lends funds directly to a debtor and receives a nonnegotiable "
"document as evidence of the asset. This category includes overdrafts, "
"mortgage loans, loans to finance trade credit and advances, repurchase "
"agreements, financial assets and liabilities created by financial leases, "
"and claims on or liabilities to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the "
"form of loans. Trade credit and advances and similar accounts payable/"
"receivable are not loans. Loans that have become marketable in secondary "
"markets should be reclassified under debt securities. However, if only "
"traded occasionally, the loan is not reclassified under debt securities "
"(IMF, 2011).</p>\n"
"<p><strong>Lines of credit</strong> and loan commitments provide a guarantee "
"that undrawn funds will be available in the future, but no financial "
"liability/asset exists until such funds are actually provided. Undrawn lines "
"of credit and undisbursed loan commitments are contingent liabilities of the "
"issuing institutions&#x2014; generally, banks (IMF, 2011). A loan or line of "
"credit refers to regulated financial institutions only.</p><div class="

msgstr ""

msgctxt "COLL_METHOD"
msgid ""
"<h2>Collection process:</h2>\n"
"<p>One of the main sources of data for this indicator currently available is "
"the Enterprise Survey conducted by the World Bank which covers the formal "
"sector and contains data for small and medium enterprises only (with 5 or "
"more employees). In some countries, additional surveys, including Informal "
"Surveys of unregistered enterprises and/or Micro Surveys for registered "
"firms with less than five employees, are conducted and available at country "
"level. </p>\n"
"<p>The Enterprise Survey is based on a representative sample of enterprises "
"run by the private sector. The surveys cover a broad range of business "
"environment topics including access to finance, corruption, infrastructure, "
"crime, competition, and performance measures. Since 2002, the World Bank has "
"collected these data from face-to-face interviews with top managers and "
"business owners in over 130,000 companies in 135 economies.</p>\n"
"<p>The surveys have been conducted since 2002 by different units within the "
"World Bank. Since 2005-06, most data collection efforts have been "
"centralized within the Enterprise Analysis Unit. Data from 2006 onward is "
"comparable across countries. The raw individual country datasets, aggregated "
"datasets (across countries and years), panel datasets, and all relevant "
"survey documentation are publicly available on the Enterprise Surveys web "
"site.</p>\n"
"<p>The indicator uses a simple weighted percentage formula, where the "
"weights are the sampling weights. The strata for Enterprise Surveys are firm "
"size, business sector, and geographic region within a country. Enterprise "
"Surveys provide indicators covering manufacturing and services activities. "
"Proportion of &#x201C;small-scale industries&#x201D; with a loan or line of "
"credit for manufacturing only can be extracted from the micro data.</p>\n"
"<p>Enterprises are classified as small, medium or large based on the number "
"of employees as follows: </p>\n"

msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Industrial enterprises are classified to small compared to large or "
"medium for their distinct nature of economic organization, production "
"capability, scale of investment and other economic characteristics. &#x201C;"
"Small-scale industries&#x201D; can be run with a small amount of capital, "
"relatively unskilled labor and using local materials. Despite their small "
"contribution to total industrial output, their role in job creation, "
"especially in developing countries is recognized to be significant where the "
"scope of absorbing surplus labor force from traditional sectors such as "
"agriculture or fishery is very high. &#x201C;Small-scale industries&#x201D; "
"are capable of meeting domestic demand of basic consumer goods such as food, "
"clothes, furniture, etc. </p>\n"
"<p>Thus &#x201C;small-scale industries&#x201D; play an important role in the "
"economy. However, it has quite limited access to financial services, "
"especially in developing countries. In order to improve the skill of workers "
"and technology for production, small-scale industrial enterprises require "
"financial support in the form of preferential loan, credit etc. This "
"indicator shows how widely financial institutions are serving the &#x201C;"
"small-scale industries&#x201D;. Together with the indicator SDG 9.3.1, this "
"indicator reflects the main message of the target 9.3 which promotes to "
"increase the access of &#x201C;small-scale industries&#x201D; to financial "
"services.</p>"

"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>The main limitation of existing national data is varying size classes by "
"country indicating that data are obtained from different target populations. "
"Data of one country are not comparable to another. </p>\n"
"<p>The definition of size class in many countries is tied up with the legal "
"and policy framework of the country. It has implications on registration "
"procedure, taxation and different waivers aimed to promote &#x201C;small-"
"scale industries&#x201D;. Therefore, countries may agree on a common size "
"class for compilation purposes. In this context, UNIDO proposes that all "
"countries compile the data by a size class of &#x201C;small-scale "
"industries&#x201D; as with less than 20 persons employed. From such data, an "
"internationally comparable data on the share of &#x201C;small-scale "
"industries&#x201D; in total could be derived. </p>"
