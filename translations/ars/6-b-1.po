"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator assesses the percentage of local administrative units (as "
"defined by the national government) that have an established and operational "
"mechanism by which individuals and communities can meaningfully contribute "
"to decisions and directions about water and sanitation management.</p>\n"
"<p>The indicator Proportion of local administrative units with established "
"and operational policies and procedures for participation of local "
"communities in water and sanitation management is currently being measured "
"by the Proportion of countries with clearly defined procedures in law or "
"policy for participation by service users/communities in planning program in "
"water and sanitation management, and hygiene promotion and the Proportion of "
"countries with high level of users/communities participating in planning "
"programs in water and sanitation management, and hygiene promotion.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>Stakeholder participation is essential to ensure the sustainability of "
"water and sanitation management options over time, e.g. the choice of "
"appropriate solutions for a given social and economic context, and the full "
"understanding of the impacts of a certain development decision. Defining the "
"procedures in policy or law for the participation of local communities is "
"vital to ensure needs of all the community is met, including the most "
"vulnerable and also encourages ownership of schemes which in turn "
"contributes to their sustainability.</p>\n"
"<p>Local administrative units refers to non-overlapping sub-districts, "
"municipalities, communes, or other local community-level units covering both "
"urban and rural areas to be defined by the government. </p>\n"
"<p>Policies and procedures for participation of local communities in water "
"and sanitation management would define a formal mechanism to ensure "
"participation of users in planning water and sanitation activities. </p>\n"
"<p>A policy or procedure is considered to be established if the mechanism "
"for participation of local communities is defined in law or has been "
"formally approved and published. It is considered to be operational if the "
"policy or procedure is being implemented, with appropriate funding in place "
"and with means for verifying that participation took place.</p>\n"
"<p>&#x2018;Water and sanitation&#x2019; includes all areas of management "
"related to each of the targets under SDG 6, namely: water supply (6.1), "
"sanitation and hygiene (6.2), wastewater treatment and ambient water quality "
"(6.3), efficiency and sustainable use (6.4), integrated water resources "
"management (6.5) and water-related ecosystems (6.6).</p>"

"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>The UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-"
"Water (GLAAS) provides information on governance, monitoring, human "
"resources, and financing in the water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) "
"sector. The UN-Water GLAAS survey is currently conducted on a biennial "
"basis, led by WHO, and collected data from 94 countries (predominantly low "
"and lower-middle income countries) in the most recent cycle in 2013-2014. "
"The scope of the question on community and user participation has been "
"expanded beyond WASH for the 2016-17 GLAAS cycle to address all targets in "
"SDG 6, including water quality, water rights/allocation, water resource "
"management, and the status of water-related ecosystems. GLAAS has completed "
"three full cycles (2009-2010, 2011-2012, and 2013-2014), as well as a pilot "
"conducted in 2008. </p>\n"
"<p>National governments participating in the GLAAS survey fill out the "
"questionnaire, preferably supported by a multi-stakeholder review. Although "
"one ministry leads the process, it is often the case that many different "
"ministries and departments must be involved in the process in order to "
"obtain the data required to complete the questionnaire. A GLAAS national "
"focal person supports the lead ministry to coordinate data collection, to "
"compile the national response to the questionnaire, and to lead on the "
"process of data validation.</p>\n"
"<p>The data will be complemented by Integrated Water Resources Management "
"(IWRM) reporting in SDG target 6.5 (for wastewater and water quality, water "
"efficiency, water resource management, and the status of water-related "
"ecosystems) (UNEP 2016). A key component of IWRM is community participation "
"and management of water resources at the local level. The analysis of IWRM "
"has been done in the past by UN-Water in 2008 (led by UN-DESA) and in 2012 "
"(led by UNEP, UNDP, GWP and SIWI) as requested by the UN Commission for "
"Sustainable Development (UN-Water 2008, 2012).</p>\n"
"<p>The OECD Water Governance Initiative (WGI), a technical platform "
"gathering 100+ members from the public, private and non-for-profit sectors, "
"is currently developing a set of Water Governance Indicators, within the "
"implementation strategy of the OECD Principles on Water Governance (OECD "
"2015a). The Water Governance Indicators are expected to be able to provide "
"additional information on local participation on the basis of an indicators "
"system proposed in OECD (2015b) for measuring &#x201C;stakeholder engagement "
"for inclusive water governance&#x201D;. An indicator providing metrics on "
"local participation will be developed and tested by 2017. Data will be made "
"available through interactive platforms and databases in a format to foster "
"policy dialogue and peer learning by 2018. A dedicated publication on "
"&#x201C;Water Governance at a Glance&#x201D; will be launched at the 8th "
