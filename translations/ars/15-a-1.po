"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>This is a twin indicator consisting of:</p>\n"
"<p>A) Official development assistance on conservation and sustainable use of "
"biodiversity, defined as gross disbursements of total Official Development "
"Assistance (ODA) from all donors for biodiversity. </p>\n"
"<p>B) Revenue generated and finance mobilised from biodiversity-relevant "
"economic instruments, defined as revenue generated and finance mobilised "
"from biodiversity-relevant economic instruments, covering biodiversity-"
"relevant taxes, fees and charges, and positive subsidies. (New on-going work "
"is underway to collect data on payments for ecosystem services and "
"biodiversity offsets -- including the finance they mobilise for "
"biodiversity).</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>A) The Development Assistance Committee (DAC) defines ODA as those flows "
"to countries and territories on the DAC list of ODA recipients and "
"multilateral institutions which are:</p>\n"
"<p>1) Provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, "
"or by their executive agencies; and</p>\n"
"<p>2) Each transaction of which:</p>\n"
"<p>a) is administered with the promotion of the economic development and "
"welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and</p>\n"
"<p>b) is concessional in character.</p>\n"

"Instruments for the Environment (to the OECD PINE database), including "
"biodiversity-relevant economic instruments. Currently more than 110 "

"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>A) The OECD/DAC has been collecting data on official and private resource "

"the CRS (CRS data are considered complete from 1995 for commitments at an "
"activity level and 2002 for disbursements). The Rio marker for biodiversity "
"was introduced in 2002. The data are provided by DAC donors, other bilateral "
"providers of development cooperation and multilateral organizations. </p>\n"
"<p>B) Information for the OECD PINE database is collected via a network of "
"200 country experts, including in government agencies (Ministries of Finance "
"and Environment, statistical institutes) as well as research institutes and "
"international organisations. Data is collected systematically for 37 OECD "
"members as well as the active accession countries. A growing number of non-"
"member countries also provide information. Currently, more than 110 "
"countries are contributing data. Registered experts are asked to update data "
"at least once a year, typically in January or February, through a password-"
"protected interface. The data collection method may result in some reporting "
"bias, as OECD members and active accession countries are likely to report "
"more data on a regular basis, and all figures should be interpreted in this "

msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>A) Total ODA flows to developing countries quantify the public effort "
"that donors provide to developing countries for biodiversity.</p>\n"
"<p>B) Economic policy instruments can either generate revenue (e.g. "
"biodiversity-relevant taxes) or mobilise finance directly for biodiversity "
"conservation and sustainable use (e.g. biodiversity-relevant fees and "
"charges; positive subsidies; PES and offsets) which is finance mobilised at "
"domestic level. </p>\n"
"<p>The data are collected in a consistent and comparable way across "
"countries.</p>"

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"

"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>A) OECD CRS data are available since 1973. However, the data coverage at "
"an activity level is considered complete from 1995 for commitments and 2002 "
"for disbursements. The Rio biodiversity marker was introduced in 2002.</p>\n"
"<p>B) The OECD PINE database tracks the biodiversity-relevant economic "
"instruments that countries have put in place, and countries are encouraged "
"to also provide information on the revenue and finance channelled via each "
"of the instruments. The comprehensiveness of data provided currently varies "
"across the biodiversity-relevant economic instruments. The data on revenue "
"generated by biodiversity-relevant taxes is currently the most "
"comprehensive. For the data on biodiversity-relevant fees and charges, for "
"example, of the total number of these instruments currently reported to the "
"PINE database, 42% also include data on the finance they generate. </p>\n"
"<p>Like all data provided by a diffuse set of respondents, the data is "
"subject to missing values, human error, and differences in interpretation of "
"the provided definitions. However, all possible efforts have been made to "
"ensure that the data is complete, accurate, and comparable across countries."
