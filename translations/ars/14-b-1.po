msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Target 14.b focuses on access to resources and markets for small-scale "
"fisheries, in line with the Rio+20 outcome document para, 175. In order to "
"guarantee secure access, an enabling environment is necessary which "
"recognizes and protects small-scale fisheries rights. Such an enabling "
"environment has three key features:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>Appropriate legal, regulatory and policy frameworks; </li>\n"
"  <li>Specific initiatives to support small-scale fisheries; and</li>\n"
"  <li>Related institutional mechanisms which allow for the participation of "
"small-scale fisheries organisations in relevant processes. </li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>The 32nd Session of the FAO Committee on Fisheries agreed that the data "
"submitted through the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF) "
"questionnaire could be used by Members for reporting on Sustainable "
"Development Goals (SDGs) indicators.</p>\n"
"<p>The indicator variables are therefore chosen from three of the five "
"questions on small-scale fisheries of the CCRF questionnaire to reflect "
"these three aspects:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>Are there any laws, regulations, policies, plans or strategies that "
"specifically target or address the small-scale fisheries sector?</li>\n"
"  <li>Are there any ongoing specific initiatives to implement the SSF "
"Guidelines?</li>\n"
"  <li>Does your country have an advisory/consultative body to the Ministry/"
"Department of Fisheries in which fishers/fish workers can participate and "
"contribute to decision-making processes?</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>The national indicator is calculated based on these questions "
"specifically focusing on actual efforts of promoting and facilitating access "
"rights to small scale fisheries.</p>\n"
"<p>Although the exact score will be important from one reporting year to the "
"next for determining the progress made by a country, to aid the "
"interpretation of this indicator, the score will then be converted into one "
"of 5 bands as following:</p>\n"

"<p>The indicator is calculated using three variables, which are given "

"in the calculation, nor the use of mixed sources. </p>\n"
"<p><strong>Variable 1</strong>: Existence of laws, regulations, policies, "

"fisheries sector</p>\n"
"<p><strong>Variable 2</strong>: Ongoing specific initiatives to implement "
"the SSF Guidelines</p>\n"
"<p><strong>Variable 3</strong>: Existence of mechanisms enabling small-scale "
"fishers and fish workers to contribute to decision-making processes </p>\n"
"<p>Performance is scored based on the country responses to the relevant "
"portions of three questions included in the Code of Conduct for Responsible "
"Fisheries Questionnaire (CCRF). These questions have been transformed into "
"weighted variables for the purpose of calculating the country scores. <u>The "
"target has been set at a positive (&#x2018;yes&#x2019;) response to all the "
