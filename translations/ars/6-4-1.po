"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The rationale behind this indicator consists in providing information on "
"the efficiency of the economic and social usage of water resources, i.e. "
"value added generated by the use of water in the main sectors of the "
"economy, and distribution network losses.</p>\n"
"<p>The distribution efficiency of water systems is implicit within the "
"calculations and could be made explicit if needed and where data are "
"available.</p>\n"
"<p>This indicator addresses specifically the target component "
"&#x201C;substantially increase water-use efficiency across all "
"sectors&#x201D;, by measuring the output per unit of water from productive "
"uses of water as well as losses in municipal water use. It does not aim at "
"giving an exhaustive picture of the water utilization in a country. Other "
"indicators, specifically those for Targets 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 5.4, 5.a, "
"6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5 will complement the information provided by this "
"indicator. In particular, the indicator needs to be combined with the water "
"stress indicator 6.4.2 to provide adequate follow-up of the target 6.4.</p>\n"
"<p>Together, the three sectoral efficiencies provide a measure of overall "
"water efficiency in a country. The indicator provides incentives to improve "
"water use efficiency through all sectors, highlighting those sectors where "
"water use efficiency is lagging behind.</p>\n"
"<p>The interpretation of the indicator would be enhanced by the utilization "
"of supplementary indicators to be used at country level. Particularly "
"important in this sense would be the indicator on efficiency of water for "
"energy and the indicator on the efficiency of the municipality distribution "
"networks.</p>"

"<h2>Disaggregation:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator covers all the economic sectors according to the ISIC "
"classification, providing the means for more detailed analysis of the water "
"use efficiency for national planning and decision-making. </p>\n"
"<p>Although the subdivision into three major aggregated economic sectors as "
"defined in chapter 3 is sufficient for the purpose of compiling the "
"indicator, wherever possible it is advisable to further disaggregate the "
"indicator, according to the following criteria:</p>\n"
"<ol>\n"
"  <li>Economically, a more refined subdivision of the economic sector can "
"be done using ISIC Rev.4 by the following groups:<ol>\n"
"      <li>Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (ISIC A); </li>\n"
"      <li>Mining and Quarrying (ISIC B); </li>\n"
"      <li>Manufacturing (ISIC C);</li>\n"
"      <li>Electricity, Gas, Steam and Air Conditioning Supply (ISIC D); "
"</li>\n"
"      <li>Water Supply, Sewerage, Waste Management and Remediation "
"Activities (ISIC E), by</li>\n"
"      <li>Water Collection, Treatment and Supply (ISIC 36) <ol>\n"
"          <li>Sewerage (ISIC 37)</li>\n"

"  <li>Geographically, computing the indicator by river basin, watershed or "
"administrative units within a country.</li>\n"

msgctxt "COMPARABILITY"
msgid ""
"<h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>\n"
"<p>Regional differences, in particular in relation to irrigated agriculture "
"and different climatic conditions (including variability), are to be "
"considered in the interpretation of this indicator, especially in countries "
"with large amounts of available water resources. Also for this reason, "
"coupling this indicator with water stress (6.4.2) is important for the "
"interpretation of the data.</p>\n"
"<h2>Obtaining internationally comparable data for global monitoring:</h2>\n"
"<p>Data for this indicator are collected through a "
"questionnaire/calculation sheet that allows countries to identify the "
"needed parameters, and provide some preliminary control checks.</p>\n"
"<p>The data so collected are then reviewed by FAO experts, also through the "
"GEMI team if needed. The finding of the review is then shared with the "
"country, in order to ensure consistency and harmonization of methods, "
"definitions and results.</p>\n"
"<p>FAO has prepared a Step-by-step methodological paper, in order to "
"provide a technical guide for the country teams. Moreover, an e-learning "
"tool, in the form of a course on-line, is being prepared and will be ready "
"early in 2018. Finally, an overall manual is being drafted.</p>"
