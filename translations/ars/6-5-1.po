"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>Indicator 6.5.1 is &#x2018;degree of integrated water resources "
"management implementation (0-100)&#x2019;. It measures the stages of "
"development and implementation of Integrated Water Resources Management "
"(IWRM), on a scale of 0 to 100, in six categories (see Rationale section). "
"The indicator score is calculated from a country survey with 33 questions, "
"with each question scored on the same scale of 0-100. </p>\n"
"<p>The definition of IWRM is based on an internationally agreed definition, "
"and is universally applicable. IWRM was officially established in 1992 and "
"is defined as &#x201C;a process which promotes the coordinated development "
"and management of water, land and related resources in order to maximise "
"economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the "
"sustainability of vital ecosystems.&#x201D; (GWP 2010). </p>\n"
"<p>The method builds on official UN IWRM status reporting, from 2008 and "
"2012, of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation from the UN World Summit "
"for Sustainable Development (1992).</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>The concept of IWRM is measured in 4 main sections, each representing key "
"dimension of IWRM: </p>\n"
"<p>1. Enabling environment: this includes the policies, laws, plans and "
"strategies which create the &#x2018;enabling environment&#x2019; for IWRM. </"
"p>\n"
"<p>2. Institutions and participation: includes the range and roles of "
"political, social, economic and administrative institutions that help to "
"support the implementation of IWRM. </p>\n"
"<p>3. Management Instruments: The tools and activities that enable decision-"
"makers and users to make rational and informed choices between alternative "
"actions. </p>\n"
"<p>4. Financing: Budgeting and financing made available and used for water "
"resources development and management from various sources.</p>\n"
"<p>The indicator is based on a national survey structured around these four "
"main sections. Each section is split into two parts: questions concerning "
"the &#x2018;National level&#x2019; and &#x2018;Other levels&#x2019; "
"respectively. &#x2018;Other levels&#x2019; includes sub-national (including "
"provinces/states for federated countries), basin level, and the "
"transboundary level as appropriate. These two parts address the wording of "
"Target 6.5 &#x2018;implement [IWRM] at all levels &#x2026;&#x2019;.</p>"

"<h1>Data sources</h1>\n"
"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>Monitoring progress on meeting SDG 6.5 is owned by and is the "
"responsibility of the national government. The government will assign a "
"ministry with the primary responsibility for overseeing this survey, which "
"will be asked to take on the responsibility of coordinating the national "
"IWRM monitoring and reporting process. As water management issues cut across "
"a wide number of sectors, often overseen by different ministries and other "
"administrative bodies at national or other levels, the process should be "
"inclusive. Major stakeholders should be involved in order to contribute to "
"well informed and objective answers to the survey. </p>\n"
"<p>The ministry is invited to nominate a national &#x201C;IWRM focal "
"point&#x201D;, who may or may not be a government official. The UN will "
"provide support where needed and possible. The following steps are suggested "
"as guidance only, as it is up to countries to decide which process or "
"processes would best serve their needs. It should also be noted that the "
"following steps represent a &#x2018;ladder&#x2019; approach, in that "
"completing all the steps will generally lead to a more robust indicator. "
"However, it may not be possible or necessary for all countries to complete "
"all steps. </p>\n"
"<p>1. The responsible ministry or IWRM focal point contacts other relevant "
"ministries/agencies to compile responses to the questionnaire. Each possible "
"response option has a score which will be used to calculate the overall "
"indicator score.</p>\n"
"<p>2. The completed draft survey is reviewed by government stakeholders. "
"These stakeholders could include those involved in water-relevant sectors, "
"such as agriculture, energy, water supply and environment, as well as water "
"management at different administrative levels. This process may be "
"electronic (e.g. via email) and/or through workshops. </p>\n"
"<p>3. The revised draft survey is validated at a multi-stakeholder workshop. "
"Apart from government representatives these stakeholders could include water "
"user associations, private sector, interest groups concerned with e.g. "
"environment, agriculture, poverty, and academia. The suggested process is "
"through a workshop but alternative means of consultation e.g. email or "
"online call for public submissions could be considered. Note that steps 2 "
"and 3 could be combined if desired. </p>\n"
"<p>4. The responsible ministry or IWRM focal point discusses with relevant "
"officials and consolidates the input into a final version. This version is "
"the basis for calculating the degree of IWRM implementation (0-100) for "
"global reporting. </p>\n"
"<p>5. The responsible ministry submits the final indicator score to the "
"national statistics office responsible for compiling all national SDG target "
"data. </p>\n"
"<p>Based on the national survey, UN-Water will periodically prepare "
"synthesis reports for regional and global levels to provide overall progress "
"on meeting SDG target 6.5. </p>\n"
