"<p>Value in percentage of weighted average tariffs applied to the imports of "
"goods in HS chapter 01-97.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>Weighted average: In order to aggregate tariff value for country groups "
"it is recommended to make use of a weighting methodology based on the value "
"of goods imported.</p>\n"
"<p>Tariffs: Tariffs are customs duties on merchandise imports, levied either "
"on an ad valorem basis (percentage of value) or on a specific basis (e.g. $7 "
"per 100 kg). Tariffs can be used to create a price advantage for similar "
"locally-produced goods and for raising government revenues. Trade remedy "
"measures and taxes are not considered to be tariffs.</p>"

"<h1>Data sources</h1>\n"
"<p>The main information used to calculate indicators 17.10.1 is import "

"directly National statistical offices, permanent country missions to the UN, "
"regional organizations or focal points within the customs, ministries in "
"charge of customs revenues (Ministry of economy/finance and related revenue "
"authorities) or, alternatively, the Ministry of trade. Tariff data for the "
"calculation of this indicator are retrieved from ITC (MAcMap) - <a href="
"\"https://www.macmap.org/\">https://www.macmap.org/</a>- WTO (IDB) - <a href="
"\"https://tao.wto.org/welcome.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f\">https://tao.wto.org/"
"welcome.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f</a> - and UNCTAD (TRAINS) databases. Import "
"tariff data included in the ITC (MAcMap) database are collected by "
"contacting directly focal points in line national agencies or regional "
"organizations (in the case of custom unions or regional economic "
"communities). When available, data are downloaded from national or regional "
"official websites. In some cases, data are purchased from private companies. "
"Import tariff data included in the WTO (IDB) database are sourced from "

"<p>Tariffs are only part of the factors that can explain the degree of "

"<p>To further refine the quality of the information, additional sub-"
"measurements could be calculated including: a) Tariff peaks (i.e. % of "
"tariffs on some products that are considerably higher than usual, defined as "
"above 15 per cent) and b) Tariff escalation (i.e. wherein a country applies "
"a higher tariff rate to products at the later stages of production). These "
"calculations were already provided by ITC as part of the MDG Gap Task Force "
"Report. See the report for further information on the methodology at <a href="

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>In order to include all tariffs into the calculation, some rates which "
"are not expressed in ad valorem form (e.g., specific duties) are converted "
"in ad valorem equivalents (i.e. in per cent of the import value), The "
"conversion is made at the tariff line level for each importer by using the "
"unit value method. Import unit values are calculated from import values and "
"quantities. Only a limited number of non-ad valorem tariff rates (i.e. "
"technical duties) cannot be provided with ad valorem equivalents (AVE) and "
"are excluded from the calculation. This methodology also allows for cross-"
"country comparisons.</p>"
