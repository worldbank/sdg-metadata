"<p>Percentage of attributes of 13 core capacities that have been attained at "
"a specific point in time. The 13 core capacities are: (1) Legislation and "
"financing; (2) IHR Coordination and National Focal Point Functions; (3) "
"Zoonotic events and the Human-Animal Health Interface; (4) Food safety; (5) "
"Laboratory; (6) Surveillance; (7) Human resources; (8) National Health "
"Emergency Framework; (9) Health Service Provision; (10) Risk communication; "
"(11) Points of entry; (12) Chemical events; (13) Radiation emergencies.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p><strong>Core capacity:</strong> the essential public health capacity that "
"States Parties are required to have in place throughout their territories "
"pursuant to Articles 5 and 12, and Annex 1A of the IHR (2005) requirements "
"by the year 2012. Thirteen core capacities and 24 indicators are defined in "
"this document. </p>\n"
"<p><strong>Indicator</strong>: a variable that can be measured repeatedly "
"(directly or indirectly) over time to reveal change in a system. It can be "
"qualitative or quantitative, allowing the objective measurement of the "
"progress of a programme or event. The quantitative measurements need to be "
"interpreted in the broader context, taking other sources of information (e."
"g. supervisory reports and special studies) into consideration and they "
"should be supplemented with qualitative information. </p>\n"
"<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> one of a set of specific elements or "
"characteristics that reflect the level of performance or achievement of a "
"specific indicator. </p>\n"
"<p><strong>Capability levels:</strong> Each attribute has been assigned a "
"level of maturity, or a &#x2018;capability level.&#x2019; Attainment of a "
"given capability level requires that all attributes at lower levels are in "
"place. In the checklist, the status of core capacity development is measured "
"at five capability levels, each of the 5 levels used is described by "
"specific indicators, according related capacity.</p>"
