"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>Harmful use of alcohol, defined according to the national context as "
"alcohol per capita consumption (aged 15 years and older) within a calendar "
"year in litres of pure alcohol</p>\n"
"<p>Total alcohol per capita consumption (APC) is defined as the total (sum "
"of recorded APC three-year average and unrecorded APC as a proportion of "
"total) amount of alcohol consumed per adult (15+ years) over a calendar "
"year, in litres of pure alcohol, adjusted for tourist consumption. Recorded "
"alcohol consumption refers to official statistics at country level "
"(production, import, export, and sales or taxation data), while the "
"unrecorded alcohol consumption refers to alcohol which is not taxed and is "
"outside the usual system of governmental control, such as home or informally "
"produced alcohol (legal or illegal), smuggled alcohol, surrogate alcohol "
"(which is alcohol not intended for human consumption), or alcohol obtained "
"through cross-border shopping (which is recorded in a different "
"jurisdiction). Tourist consumption takes into account tourists visiting the "
"country and inhabitants visiting other countries. Positive figures denote "
"alcohol consumption of outbound tourists being greater than alcohol "
"consumption by inbound tourists, negative numbers the opposite. Tourist "
"consumption is based on UN statistics, and data are provided by IHME.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>Recorded alcohol per capita (15+) consumption of pure alcohol is "
"calculated as the sum of beverage-specific alcohol consumption of pure "
"alcohol (beer, wine, spirits, other) from different sources. The first "
"priority in the decision tree is given to government national statistics; "
"second are country-specific alcohol industry statistics in the public domain "
"based on interviews or fieldwork (GlobalData (formerly Canadean), "
"International Wine and Spirit Research (IWSR), Wine Institute; historically "
"World Drink Trends) or data from the International Organisation of Vine and "
"Wine (OIV); third is the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United "
"Nations&apos; statistical database (FAOSTAT), and fourth is data from "
"alcohol industry statistics in the public domain based on desk review. For "
"countries, where the data source is FAOSTAT the unrecorded consumption may "
"be included in the recorded consumption. As from the introduction of the "
"&quot;Other&quot; beverage-specific category, beer includes malt beers, wine "
"includes wine made from grapes, spirits include all distilled beverages, and "
"other includes one or several other alcoholic beverages, such as fermented "
"beverages made from sorghum, maize, millet, rice, or cider, fruit wine, "
"fortified wine, etc. For unrecorded APC, the first priority in the decision "
"tree is given to nationally representative empirical data; these are often "
"general population surveys in countries where alcohol is legal. Second are "
"specific other empirical investigations, and third is expert opinion "
"supported by periodic survey of experts at country level (50 countries with "
"significant estimates of unrecorded alcohol consumption) using modified "
"Delphi-technique.</p>\n"
"<p>For recorded APC, in order to make the conversion into litres of pure "
"alcohol, the alcohol content (% alcohol by volume) is considered to be as "
"follows: Beer (barley beer 5%), Wine (grape wine 12%; must of grape 9%, "
"vermouth 16%), Spirits (distilled spirits 40%; spirit-like 30%), and Other "
"(sorghum, millet, maize beers 5%; cider 5%; fortified wine 17% and 18%; "
"fermented wheat and fermented rice 9%; other fermented beverages 9%). Survey "
"questions on consumption of unrecorded alcohol are converted into estimates "
"per year of unrecorded APC. In some countries, unrecorded is estimated based "
"on confiscated alcohol confiscated by customs or police.</p>\n"
"<p>The litres of alcohol consumed by tourists (15 years of age and older) in "
"a country were based on the number of tourists who visited a country, the "
"average amount of time they spent in the country, and how much these people "
"drink on average in their countries of origin (estimated based on per capita "
"consumption of recorded and unrecorded alcohol). Furthermore, tourist "
"alcohol consumption also accounted for the inhabitants of a country "
"consuming alcohol while visiting other countries (based on the average time "
"spent outside of their country (for all people 15 years and older) and the "
"amount of alcohol consumed in their country of origin). These estimations "
"assumed the following: (1) that people drink the same amounts of alcohol "
"when they are tourists as they do in their home countries, and (2) that "
"global tourist consumption is equal to 0 (and thus tourist consumption can "
"be either net negative or positive).</p>"

"<p>The Global Survey on Alcohol and Health is conducted periodically (latest "

"counterparts or focal points in all WHO Member States are officially "
"nominated by the respective ministries of health. They are provided with the "
"online survey data collection tool for completion. Where this is not "
"feasible, a hard copy of the tool is forwarded directly to those who "
"requested it. The survey submissions are checked and whenever information is "
"incomplete or in need of clarification, the questionnaire is returned to the "
"focal point or national counterpart in the country concerned for revision. "
"Amendments to the survey responses are resubmitted by e-mail or "
"electronically. Data submitted from countries is triangulated with data from "
"key industry-supported data providers at annual meetings organized by WHO "
"with an objective to identify discrepancies and solutions. Estimates for key "
"indicators are compiled into country profiles which are sent to the focal "
"point or national counterpart in the country for validation and endorsement."

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Alcohol consumption can have an impact not only on the incidence of "
"diseases, injuries and other health conditions, but also on the course of "
"disorders and their outcomes in individuals. Alcohol consumption has been "
"identified as a component cause for more than 200 diseases, injuries and "
"other health conditions. Per capita alcohol consumption is widely accepted "
"as the best possible indicator of alcohol exposure in populations and the "
"key indicator for estimation of alcohol-attributable disease burden and "
"alcohol-attributable deaths. Its correct interpretation requires the use of "
"additional population-based indicators such as prevalence of drinking, and, "
"as a result, stimulates development of national monitoring systems on "
"alcohol and health involving contributions from a wide range of "
"stakeholders, including alcohol production and trade sectors.</p>"

"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator is feasible and suitable for monitoring purposes as "
"evidenced by availability of data from 190 countries and inclusion of this "
"indicator in global, regional and national monitoring frameworks. This is "
"the key indicator for alcohol exposure in populations. The data available "
"(based on production, import, export, and sales or taxation) do not enable "
"the disaggregation of alcohol per capita consumption (APC) by sex or age; to "
"this end, other data sources, such as survey data, are needed. The "
"estimation of unrecorded APC remains a challenge, and triangulation of data "
"from different sources as well as Delphi-techniques are used for increasing "
"validity of estimates. In recent time the number of research activities "
"focused on improvement of the estimates of unrecorded alcohol consumption as "
"well as their geographical coverage have increased substantially. As a "
"result, it leads to a more accurate assessment of the total amount of "
"alcohol consumed per person per year in a given country.</p>"
