"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>The mortality attributable to the joint effects of household and ambient "
"air pollution can be expressed as: Number of deaths, Death rate. Death rates "
"are calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the total population (or "
"indicated if a different population group is used, e.g. children under 5 "
"years).</p>\n"
"<p>Evidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to air "
"pollution is linked, among others, to the important diseases taken into "
"account in this estimate:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>Acute respiratory infections in young children (estimated under 5 "
"years of age);</li>\n"
"  <li>Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) in adults (estimated above 25 years);"
"</li>\n"
"  <li>Ischaemic heart diseases (IHD) in adults (estimated above 25 years);</"
"li>\n"
"  <li>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults (estimated "
"above 25 years); and</li>\n"
"  <li>Lung cancer in adults (estimated above 25 years).</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>The mortality resulting from exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution "
"and household (indoor) air pollution from polluting fuels use for cooking "
"was assessed. Ambient air pollution results from emissions from industrial "
"activity, households, cars and trucks which are complex mixtures of air "
"pollutants, many of which are harmful to health. Of all of these pollutants, "
"fine particulate matter has the greatest effect on human health. By "

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>As part of a broader project to assess major risk factors to health, the "
"mortality resulting from exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution and "
"household (indoor) air pollution from polluting fuel use for cooking was "
"assessed. Ambient air pollution results from emissions from industrial "
"activity, households, cars and trucks which are complex mixtures of air "
"pollutants, many of which are harmful to health. Of all of these pollutants, "
"fine particulate matter has the greatest effect on human health. By "
"polluting fuels is understood as wood, coal, animal dung, charcoal, and crop "
"wastes, as well as kerosene.</p>\n"
"<p>Air pollution is the biggest environmental risk to health. The majority "
"of the burden is borne by the populations in low and middle-income countries."
"</p>"

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>An approximation of the combined effects of risk factors is possible if "
"independence and little correlation between risk factors with impacts on the "
"same diseases can be assumed (Ezzati et al, 2003). In the case of air "
"pollution, however, there are some limitations to estimate the joint "
"effects: limited knowledge on the distribution of the population exposed to "
"both household and ambient air pollution, correlation of exposures at "
"individual level as household air pollution is a contributor to ambient air "
"pollution, and non-linear interactions (Lim et al, 2012; Smith et al, 2014). "
"In several regions, however, household air pollution remains mainly a rural "
"issue, while ambient air pollution is predominantly an urban problem. Also, "
"in some continents, many countries are relatively unaffected by household "
"air pollution, while ambient air pollution is a major concern. If assuming "
"independence and little correlation, a rough estimate of the total impact "
"can be calculated, which is less than the sum of the impact of the two risk "
"factors.</p>"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>Attributable mortality is calculated by first combining information on "
"the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure, with "
"information on how widespread the exposure is in the population (e.g. the "
"annual mean concentration of particulate matter to which the population is "
"exposed, proportion of population relying primarily on polluting fuels for "
"cooking).</p>\n"
"<p>This allows calculation of the &apos;population attributable "
"fraction&apos; (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given "
"population that can be attributed to the exposure (e.g in that case of both "
"the annual mean concentration of particulate matter and exposure to "
"polluting fuels for cooking).</p>\n"
"<p>Applying this fraction to the total burden of disease (e.g. "
"cardiopulmonary disease expressed as deaths), gives the total number of "
"deaths that results from exposure to that particular risk factor (in the "
"example given above, to ambient and household air pollution).</p>\n"
"<p>To estimate the combined effects of risk factors, a joint population "
"attributable fraction is calculated, as described in Ezzati et al (2003).</"
"p>\n"
"<p>The mortality associated with household and ambient air pollution was "
"estimated based on the calculation of the joint population attributable "
"fractions assuming independently distributed exposures and independent "
"hazards as described in (Ezzati et al, 2003).</p>\n"
"<p>The joint population attributable fraction (PAF) were calculated using "
"the following formula:</p>\n"
"<p>PAF=1-PRODUCT (1-PAFi) </p>\n"
"<p>where PAFi is PAF of individual risk factors.</p>\n"
"<p>The PAF for ambient air pollution and the PAF for household air pollution "
"were assessed separately, based on the Comparative Risk Assessment (Ezzati "
"et al, 2002) and expert groups for the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 "
"study (Lim et al, 2012; Smith et al, 2014).</p>\n"
"<p>For exposure to ambient air pollution, annual mean estimates of "
"particulate matter of a diameter of less than 2.5 um (PM25) were modelled as "
"described in (WHO 2016, forthcoming), or for Indicator 11.6.2.</p>\n"
"<p>For exposure to household air pollution, the proportion of population "
"with primary reliance on polluting fuels use for cooking was modelled (see "
"Indicator 7.1.2 [polluting fuels use=1-clean fuels use]). Details on the "
"model are published in (Bonjour et al, 2013). </p>\n"
"<p>The integrated exposure-response functions (IER) developed for the GBD "
"2010 (Burnett et al, 2014) and further updated for the GBD 2013 study "
"(Forouzanfar et al, 2015) were used.</p>\n"
"<p>The percentage of the population exposed to a specific risk factor (here "
"ambient air pollution, i.e. PM2.5) was provided by country and by increment "
"of 1 ug/m3; relative risks were calculated for each PM2.5 increment, based "
"on the IER. The counterfactual concentration was selected to be between 5.6 "
"and 8.8 ug/m3, as described elsewhere (Ezzati et al, 2002; Lim et al, 2012). "
"The country population attributable fraction for ALRI, COPD, IHD, stroke and "
"lung cancer were calculated using the following formula:</p>\n"
"<p>PAF=SUM(Pi(RR-1)/(SUM(RR-1)+1)</p>\n"
"<p>where i is the level of PM2.5 in ug/m3, and Pi is the percentage of the "
"population exposed to that level of air pollution, and RR is the relative "
"risk.</p>\n"
"<p>The calculations for household air pollution are similar, and are "
"explained in detailed elsewhere (WHO 2014a).</p>"
