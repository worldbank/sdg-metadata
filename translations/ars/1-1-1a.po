"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator &#x201C;proportion of the population below the "
"international poverty line&#x201D; is defined as the percentage of the "
"population living on less than $1.90 a day at 2011 international prices. The "
"&apos;international poverty line&apos; is currently set at $1.90 a day at "
"2011 international prices. </p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>In assessing poverty in a given country, and how best to reduce poverty, "
"one naturally focuses on a poverty line that is considered appropriate for "
"that country. But how do we talk meaningfully about &#x201C;global poverty?"
"&#x201D; Poverty lines across countries vary in terms of their purchasing "
"power, and they have a strong economic gradient, such that richer countries "
"tend to adopt higher standards of living in defining poverty. But to "
"consistently measure global absolute poverty in terms of consumption we need "
"to treat two people with the same purchasing power over commodities the same "
"way&#x2014;both are either poor or not poor&#x2014;even if they live in "
"different countries.</p>\n"
"<p>Since World Development Report 1990, the World Bank has aimed to apply a "
"common standard in measuring extreme poverty, anchored to what poverty means "
"in the world&apos;s poorest countries. The welfare of people living in "
"different countries can be measured on a common scale by adjusting for "
"differences in the purchasing power of currencies. The commonly used $1 a "
"day standard, measured in 1985 international prices and adjusted to local "
"currency using PPPs, was chosen for World Development Report 1990 because it "
"was typical of the poverty lines in low-income countries at the time. As "
"differences in the cost of living across the world evolve, the international "
"poverty line has to be periodically updated using new PPP price data to "
"reflect these changes. The last change was in October 2015, when the World "
"Bank adopted $1.90 as the international poverty line using the 2011 PPP. "
"Prior to that, the 2008 update set the international poverty line at $1.25 "
"using the 2005 PPP. Poverty measures based on international poverty lines "
"attempt to hold the real value of the poverty line constant across "
"countries, as is done when making comparisons over time. Early editions of "
"the World Bank&#x2019;s World Development Indicators (WDI) used PPPs from "
"the Penn World Tables to convert values in local currency to equivalent "
"purchasing power measured in U.S dollars. Later editions used 1993, 2005, "
"and 2011 consumption PPP estimates produced by the World Bank&#x2019;s "
"International Comparison Program (ICP).</p>"

"<p>Within the World Bank, the Global Poverty Working Group (GPWG) is in "

"GPWG archives the datasets obtained from NSOs and then harmonizes them, "
"applying common methodologies. The objective of the GPWG is to ensure that "
"poverty and inequality data generated, curated, and disseminated by the "
"World Bank are up to date, meet high-quality standards, and are well "
"documented and consistent across dissemination channels. Members of GPWG "
"generate and update the estimates for the proportion of population below the "
"international poverty line using raw data typically provided by country "
"governments. The raw data are obtained by poverty economists through their "
"contacts in the NSOs, and checked for quality before being submitted for "
"further analysis. The raw data can be unit-record survey data, or grouped "
"data, depending on the agreements with the country governments. In most "
"cases, the welfare aggregate, the essential element for poverty estimation, "
"is generated by the country governments. Sometimes, the World Bank has to "
"construct the welfare aggregate or adjust the aggregate provided by the "

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Monitoring poverty is important on the global development agenda as well "
"as on the national development agenda of many countries. The World Bank "
"produced its first global poverty estimates for developing countries for "
"World Development Report 1990: Poverty (World Bank 1990) using household "
"survey data for 22 countries (Ravallion, Datt, and van de Walle 1991). Since "
"then there has been considerable expansion in the number of countries that "
"field household income and expenditure surveys. The World Bank&apos;s "
"Development Research Group maintains a database that is updated annually as "
"new survey data become available (and thus may contain more recent data or "
"revisions) and conducts a major reassessment of progress against poverty "
"every year. PovcalNet is an interactive computational tool that allows users "
"to replicate these internationally comparable $1.90 and $3.10 a day global, "
"regional and country-level poverty estimates and to compute poverty measures "
"for custom country groupings and for different poverty lines. </p>\n"
"<p>The Poverty and Equity Data portal provides access to the database and "
"user-friendly dashboards with graphs and interactive maps that visualize "
"trends in key poverty and inequality indicators for different regions and "
"countries. The country dashboards display trends in poverty measures based "
"on the national poverty lines alongside the internationally comparable "
"estimates, produced from and consistent with PovcalNet.</p>"

"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>Five countries &#x2013; Bangladesh, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Jordan, and "
"Laos &#x2013; use the 2005 PPP conversion factors and corresponding $1.25 a "
"day and $2 a day poverty lines. This is due to the large deviations in the "
"rate of change in PPP factors relative to the rate of change in domestic "
"consumer price indexes. See Box 1.1 in the Global Monitoring Report "
"2015/2016 (<a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-"
"monitoring-report\">http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-"
"monitoring-report</a>) for a detailed explanation.</p>\n"
"<p>Despite progress in the last decade, the challenges of measuring poverty "
"remain. The timeliness, frequency, quality, and comparability of household "
"surveys needs to increase substantially, particularly in the poorest "
"countries. The availability and quality of poverty monitoring data remains "
"low in small states, countries with fragile situations, and low-income "
"countries and even some middle-income countries. The low frequency and lack "
"of comparability of the data available in some countries create uncertainty "
"over the magnitude of poverty reduction. </p>\n"
"<p>Besides the frequency and timeliness of survey data, other data quality "
"issues arise in measuring household living standards. The surveys ask "
"detailed questions on sources of income and how it was spent, which must be "
"carefully recorded by trained personnel. Income is generally more difficult "
"to measure accurately, and consumption comes closer to the notion of living "
"standards. And income can vary over time even if living standards do not. "
"But consumption data are not always available: the latest estimates reported "
"here use consumption data for about two-thirds of countries.</p>\n"
"<p>However, even similar surveys may not be strictly comparable because of "
"differences in timing or in the quality and training of enumerators. "
"Comparisons of countries at different levels of development also pose a "
"potential problem because of differences in the relative importance of the "
"consumption of nonmarket goods. The local market value of all consumption in "
"kind (including own production, particularly important in underdeveloped "
"rural economies) should be included in total consumption expenditure but may "
"not be. Most survey data now include valuations for consumption or income "
"from own production, but valuation methods vary.</p>"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>To measure poverty across countries consistently, the World Bank&#x2019;s "
"international measures apply a common standard, anchored to what &#x201C;"
"poverty&#x201D; means in the world&#x2019;s poorest countries. The original "
"&#x201C;$1-a-day&#x201D; line was based on a compilation of national lines "
"for only 22 developing countries, mostly from academic studies in the 1980s "
"(Ravallion, et al., 1991). While this was the best that could be done at the "
"time, the sample was hardly representative of developing countries even in "
"the 1980s. Since then, national poverty lines have been developed for many "
"other countries. Based on a new compilation of national lines for 75 "
"developing countries, Ravallion, Chen and Sangraula (RCS) (2009) proposed a "
"new international poverty line of $1.25 a day. This is the average poverty "
"line for the poorest 15 countries in their data set. </p>\n"
"<p>The current extreme poverty line is set at $1.90 a day in 2011 PPP terms, "
"which represents the mean of the national poverty lines found in the same "
"poorest 15 countries ranked by per capita consumption. The new poverty line "
"maintains the same standard for extreme poverty - the poverty line typical "
"of the poorest countries in the world - but updates it using the latest "
"information on the cost of living in developing countries. </p>\n"
"<p>When measuring international poverty of a country, the international "
"poverty line at PPP is converted to local currencies in 2011 price and is "
"then converted to the prices prevailing at the time of the relevant "
"household survey using the best available Consumer Price Index (CPI). "
"(Equivalently, the survey data on household consumption or income for the "
"survey year are expressed in the prices of the ICP base year, and then "
"converted to PPP $&#x2019;s.) Then the poverty rate is calculated from that "
"survey. All inter-temporal comparisons are real, as assessed using the "
"country-specific CPI. Interpolation/extrapolation methods are used to line "
"up the survey-based estimates with these reference years.</p>"

"<h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>At country level:</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>There is no &#x201C;imputation&#x201D; in the traditional sense for "
"missing country data. However, to generate regional and global aggregates "
"for reference years, country-level data are imputed for the years when "
"surveys are not conducted. These imputed data are to be used for "
"aggregation, but not for replacing the actual survey data. The subsequent "
"section on the treatment of missing values at the regional and global levels "
"provide more details on the imputation method.</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>At regional and global levels:</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>To compare the poverty rates across countries and compute regional "
"aggregates, country estimates must be &#x201C;lined up&#x201D; first to a "
"common reference year, interpolating for countries in which survey data are "
"not available in the reference year but are available either before, after, "
"or both. The more survey data are available (that is, the more data for "
"different years), the more accurate the interpolation.</p>\n"
"<p>The process requires adjusting the mean income or expenditure observed in "
"the survey year by a growth factor to infer the unobserved level in the "
"reference year. Thus, two assumptions are required to implement this "
"process: distribution-neutral growth and a real rate of growth between the "
"survey and reference year.</p>\n"
"<p>Distribution-neutral growth implies that income or expenditure levels are "
"adjusted for growth assuming that the underlying relative distribution of "
"income or expenditure observed in survey years remains unchanged. Under this "
"assumption, it is straightforward to interpolate the poverty estimate in a "
"given reference year implied by a given rate of growth in income or "
"expenditure. Rates of change in real consumption per capita should be based "
"on the change in real consumption measured by comparing country survey data "
"across different years. In practice, however, survey data in most countries "
"are not available on an annual basis. Therefore, the change in private "
"consumption per capita as measured from the national accounts is used "
"instead. While, there can be no guarantee that the survey-based measure of "
"income or consumption change at exactly the same rate as private consumption "
"in the national accounts, this appears to be the best available option.</p>\n"
"<p>When the reference year falls between two survey years, an estimate of "
"mean consumption at the reference year is constructed by extrapolating the "
"means obtained from the surveys forward and backward to the reference year. "
"The second step is to compute the headcount poverty rate at the reference "
"year after normalizing the distributions observed in the two survey years by "
"the reference year mean. This yields two estimates of the headcount poverty "
"rates in the reference year. The final reported poverty headcount rate for "
"the reference years is the linear interpolation of the two. When data from "
"only one survey year are available, the reference year mean is based on the "
"survey mean by applying the growth rate in private consumption per capita "
"from the national accounts. The reference year poverty estimate is then "
"based on this mean and on the distribution observed in the one survey year. "
"The better data coverage is in terms of number and frequency of available "
"surveys, the more accurate this lining-up process is and the more reliable "
"the regional estimates will be.</p>\n"
"<p>The aggregate headcount ratio for a region is the population-weighted "
"mean of the headcount indices across the countries in that region. The "
"number of poor in each region is the product of the region&#x2019;s "
"headcount index and total regional population. This assumes that the poverty "
"rate for a country without a household survey is the regional average.</p>"
