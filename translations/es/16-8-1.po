"<h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>\n"
"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>The proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in "
"international organizations has two components, the developing country "
"proportion of voting rights and the developing country proportion of "
"membership in international organisations. In some institutions these two "
"components are identical.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator is calculated independently for eleven different "
"international institutions: The United Nations General Assembly, the United "
"Nations Security Council, the United Nations Economic and Social Council, "
"the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction "
"and Development, the International Finance Corporation, the African "
"Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American "
"Development Bank, the World Trade Organisation, and the Financial Stability "
"Board.</p>\n"
"<p>There is no established convention for the designation of "
"&quot;developed&quot; and &quot;developing&quot; countries or areas in the "
"United Nations system. In common practice, Japan in Asia, Canada and the "
"United States in northern America, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania, "
"and Europe are considered &quot;developed&quot; regions or areas. The "
"aggregation across all institutions is currently done according to the "
"United Nations M.49 statistical standard which includes designation of "
"&#x201C;developed regions&#x201D; and &#x201C;developing regions&#x201D;, "
"while an ongoing review seeks to reach agreement on how to define these "
"terms for the purposes of SDG monitoring. The designations "
"&quot;developed&quot; and developing&quot; are intended for statistical "
"convenience and do not necessarily express a judgement about the stage "
"reached by a particular country or area in the development process.</p>"
