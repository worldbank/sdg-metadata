"<h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>\n"
"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>The proportion of the employed population below the international poverty "
"line of US$1.90 per day, also referred to as the working poverty rate, is "
"defined as the share of employed persons living in households with per-"
"capita consumption or income that is below the international poverty line of "
"US$1.90.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Employment:</em></strong> All persons of working age who, "
"during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to "
"produce goods or provide services for pay or profit.</p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Poverty Line:</em></strong> Threshold below which individuals "
"in the reference population are considered poor and above which they are "
"considered non-poor. The threshold is generally defined as the per-capita "
"monetary requirements an individual needs to afford the purchase of a basic "
"bundle of goods and services. For the purpose of this indicator, an absolute "
"international poverty line of US$1.90 per day is used.</p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Household in poverty:</em></strong> Households are defined as "
"poor if their income or consumption expenditure is below the poverty line "
"taking into account the number of household members and composition (e.g., "
"number of adults and children).</p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Working poor:</em></strong> Employed persons living in "
"households that are classified as poor, that is, that have income or "
"consumption levels below the poverty line used for measurement.</p>"

msgctxt "SOURCE_TYPE"
msgid ""
"<h1>Data sources</h1>\n"
"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>The preferred data source is a household survey with variables that can "
"reliably identify both the poverty status of households and the economic "
"activity of the household&#x2019;s members. Examples include household "
"income and expenditure surveys (HIES), living standards measurement surveys "
"(LSMS) with employment modules, or labour force surveys (LFS) that collect "
"information on household income. Such surveys offer the benefit of allowing "
"the employment status and income (or consumption expenditure) variables to "
"be derived from the same sampled households ideally for the same observation "
"period.</p>\n"
"<p>Employment estimates derived from a household survey other than a labour "
"force survey may, however, not be the most robust due to questionnaire "
"design. Similarly, a labour force survey may not be the best instrument for "
"collecting household income or consumption expenditure data, although an "
"attached income module can be designed to achieve statistically reliable "
"results, including ensuring an overlap in the observation period between "
"household income (or consumption expenditure) and employment status. </p>\n"
"<p>Another possibility is to combine data from a household income and "
"expenditure survey and from a separate labour force survey when the "
"respondent households can be matched and consistency in the long observation "
"period between the surveys can be obtained.</p>"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>In order to eradicate poverty, we must understand the root causes of "
"poverty. </p>\n"
"<p>The working poverty rate reveals the proportion of the employed "
"population living in poverty despite being employed, implying that their "
"employment-related incomes are not sufficient to lift them and their "
"families out of poverty and ensure decent living conditions. The adequacy of "
"earnings is a fundamental aspect of job quality, and these deficits in job "
"quality could be keeping workers and their families in poverty.</p>\n"
"<p>The proportion of working poor in total employment (that is, the working "
"poverty rate) combines data on household income or consumption with labour "
"force framework variables measured at the individual level and sheds light "
"on the relationship between employment and household poverty.</p>"

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>At the country level, comparisons over time may be affected by such "
"factors as changes in survey types or data collection methods. The use of "
"PPPs rather than market exchange rates ensures that differences in price "
"levels across countries are taken into account. However, it cannot be "
"categorically asserted that two people in two different countries, living "
"below US$1.90 a day at PPP, face the same degree of deprivation or have the "
"same degree of need.</p>\n"
"<p>Poverty in the context of this indicator is a concept that is applied to "
"households, and not to individuals, based on the assumption that households "
"pool their income. This assumption may not always be true.</p>\n"
"<p>Moreover, the poverty status of a household is a function of the wage and "
"other employment-related income secured by those household members in "
"employment, income derived from asset ownership, plus any other available "
"income such as transfer payments and the number of household members. "
"Whether a worker is counted as working poor therefore depends on his or her "
"own income, the income of other household members and the number of "
"household members who need to be supported. It is thus often valuable to "
"study household structure in relation to working poverty. </p>"
