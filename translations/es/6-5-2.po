"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>The proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational "
"arrangement for water cooperation is defined as the proportion of "
"transboundary basins area within a country with an operational arrangement "
"for water cooperation. It is derived by adding up the surface area in a "
"country of those transboundary surface water catchments and transboundary "
"aquifers (i.e. &#x2018;transboundary&#x2019; basins) that are covered by an "
"operational arrangement and dividing the obtained area by the aggregate "
"total area in a country of all transboundary basins (both catchments and "
"aquifers). The result is multiplied by 100 to obtain it expressed as "
"percentage share.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>&quot;The proposed monitoring has as basis the spatial coverage of "
"transboundary basins shared by each country, and focuses on monitoring "
"whether these are covered by cooperation arrangements that are operational. "
"The criteria needing to be met for the cooperation on a specific basin being "
"considered &#x201C;operational&#x201D; seeks to capture whether the "
"arrangement(s) indeed provide an adequate basis for cooperation in water "
"management. </p>\n"
"<p>Transboundary basins are basins of transboundary waters, that is, of any "
"surface waters (notably rivers, lakes) or groundwaters which mark, cross or "
"are located on boundaries between by two or more states. For the purpose of "
"the calculation of this indicator, for surface waters, the basin is the "
"extent of the catchment area; for groundwater, the area considered is the "
"extent of the aquifer. </p>\n"
"<p>Arrangement for water cooperation: a bilateral or multilateral treaty, "
"convention, agreement or other formal arrangement, such as memorandum of "
"understanding) between riparian countries that provides a framework for "
"cooperation on transboundary water management. Agreements or other kind of "
"formal arrangements may be interstate, intergovernmental, interministerial, "
"interagency or between regional authorities. </p>\n"
"<p>Operational: For an agreement or other kind of formal arrangement (e.g. a "
"memorandum of understanding) for cooperation between the riparian countries "
"to be considered operational, all the following criteria needs to be "
"fulfilled: </p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>There is a joint body, joint mechanism or commission (e.g. a river "
"basin organization) for transboundary cooperation </li>\n"
"  <li>There are regular formal communications between riparian countries in "
"form of meetings </li>\n"

"objectives have been set</li>\n"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Most of the world&#x2019;s water resources are shared: 592 transboundary "
"aquifers have been identified and transboundary lake and river basins cover "
"nearly one half of the Earth&#x2019;s land surface and account for an "
"estimated 60% of global freshwater. Approximately 40% of the world&#x2019;s "
"population lives in river and lake basins shared by two or more countries "
"and over 90% lives in countries that share basins. Development of water "
"resources has impacts across transboundary basins, potentially on co-"
"riparian countries, and use of surface water or groundwater may affect the "
"other resource, these usually being interlinked. Intensive water use, flow "
"regulation or pollution risks going as far as compromising co-riparian "
"countries&#x2019; development aspirations and therefore transboundary "
"cooperation is required. However, cooperation is in most cases not advanced. "
"</p>\n"
"<p>Specific agreements or other arrangements concluded between co-riparian "
"countries are a key precondition to ensure long-term, sustainable "
"cooperation. International customary water law (as reflected in the "
"Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International "
"Watercourses (New York, 1997), the Convention on the Protection and Use of "
"Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Helsinki, 1992), and the "
"draft Articles on The Law of Transboundary Aquifers (2008; UN General "
"Assembly resolutions 63/124, 66/104, and 68/118)), as well as existing "
"experience and good practices, all point to minimum requirements for "
"operational cooperation. These minimum requirements are captured by the four "
"criteria for operationality.</p>\n"
"<p>This is the basis for the explicit call for transboundary water "
"cooperation in the wording of target 6.5 and the importance of monitoring "
"this indicator to complement indicator 6.5.1 which measures the advancement "
"of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM).</p>\n"
"<p>Progress by a particular country towards the cooperation aspect of target "
"6.5, reflected by the value of indicator 6.5.2, can be achieved either by "
"establishing new operational cooperation arrangements with co-riparian "
"countries, or making existing arrangements operational by developing and "
"regularizing activities, or expanding the coverage of cooperation "
"arrangements with the ultimate objective to cover all surface waters and "
"groundwaters.</p>"

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>The spatial information on transboundary surface water basins&#x2019; "
"boundaries and the extents of the catchment areas are commonly available and "
"essentially static; consequently, once determined, no updating need is "
"expected.</p>\n"
"<p>The information on the areal extent of transboundary aquifers may evolve "
"over time as such information is generally more coarse but likely to improve "
"because of the evolving knowledge on aquifers. Technical studies and "
"exchange of information will improve the delineation and might also lead to "
"the identification of additional transboundary aquifers.</p>\n"
"<p>In situations where more than two riparian countries share a basin, but "
"only some of them have operational cooperation arrangements, the indicator "
"value may mask the gap that a riparian country does not have cooperation "
"arrangements with both its upstream and downstream neighbours. Such "
"complementary information can be obtained by aggregating data at the level "
"of the basins but not from the reporting at the national level. </p>\n"
"<p>The legal basis for cooperation develops slowly: conclusion of new "
"agreements on transboundary waters is commonly a long process that takes "
"many years. </p>\n"
"<p>The operationality of cooperation is more dynamic as it evolves with the "
"expansion of cooperation. The operationality can be expected to evolve over "
"shorter time frames, and in a year or two, progress could potentially be "
"observed.</p>"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Step 1 Identify the transboundary surface waters and "
"aquifers</em></strong></p>\n"
"<p>While the identification of transboundary surface water is "
"straightforward, the identification of transboundary aquifers requires "
"investigations.</p>\n"
"<p>If there are no transboundary surface waters or groundwaters, reporting "
"is not applicable.</p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Step 2 Calculate the surface area of each transboundary basin "
"and the total sum</em></strong></p>\n"
"<p>Commonly at least the basins of the rivers and lakes have been delineated "
"through topographic maps and the basin area is known or easily measurable. </"
"p>\n"
"<p>The total transboundary surface area in the country is the sum of the "
"surface areas in the country of each of the transboundary basins and "
"aquifers (expressed in km2). Transboundary areas for different types of "
"systems (e.g. river basin and aquifer) or multiple aquifers may overlap. The "
"area of transboundary aquifers, even if located within a transboundary river "
"basin, should be added to be able to track progress of cooperation on "
"transboundary aquifers. </p>\n"
"<p>The calculations can most easily be carried with Geographical Information "
"Systems (GIS). Once generated, with appropriate tools for spatial analysis, "
"the shapes of the surface catchments and the aquifers can be used to report "
"both disaggregated (for the surface water basin or aquifer) and aggregated "
"(agreement exists on either one).</p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Step 3 Review existing arrangements for transboundary "
"cooperation in water management and verify which transboundary waters are "
"covered by a cooperation arrangement</em></strong></p>\n"
"<p>Some operational arrangements for integrated management of transboundary "
"waters in place cover both surface waters and groundwaters. In such cases, "
"it should be clear that the geographical extent of both is used to calculate "
"the indicator value.</p>\n"
"<p>In other cases, the area of application may be limited to a border "
"section of the watercourse and in such cases only the corresponding area "
"should be considered as potentially having an operational arrangement for "
"calculating the indicator value. </p>\n"
"<p>At the end of this step, it should be known which transboundary basins "
"are covered by cooperation arrangements (and their respective areas). </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Step 4 Check which of the existing arrangements for "
"transboundary cooperation in water management are operational</em></strong></"
"p>\n"
"<p>The following check-list allows determining whether the cooperation "
"arrangement on a particular basin or in relation to a particular co-riparian "
"country is operational:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>existence of a joint body, joint mechanism or commission for "
"transboundary cooperation </li>\n"
"  <li>regularity of formal communication in form of meetings </li>\n"
"  <li>existence of joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or of "
"joint objectives </li>\n"
"  <li>regular exchange of information and data </li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>If any of the conditions is not met, the cooperation arrangement cannot "
"be considered operational. This information is currently available in "
"countries and can also be withdrawn from global, regional or basin reporting "
"systems.</p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Step 5 Calculate the indicator value</em></strong></p>\n"
"<p>That is, the area share by adding up the surface area in the country of "
"those transboundary surface water basins or aquifers that are covered by an "
"operational cooperation arrangement and dividing it by the total summed up "
"area in the country of all transboundary basins (including aquifers), "
"multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage share.</p>"
