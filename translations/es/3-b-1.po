msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>This indicator aims to measure access to vaccines, including the newly "
"available or underutilized vaccines, at the national level. In the past "
"decades all countries added numerous new and underutilised vaccines in their "
"national immunization schedule and there are several vaccines under final "
"stage of development to be introduced by 2030. For monitoring diseases "
"control and impact of vaccines it is important to measure coverage from each "
"vaccine in national immunization schedule and the system is already in place "
"for all national programmes, however direct measurement for proportion of "
"population covered with all vaccines in the programme is only feasible if "
"the country has a well-functioning national nominal immunization registry, "
"usually an electronic one that will allow this coverage to be easily "
"estimated. While countries will develop and strengthen immunization "
"registries it is a need for an alternative measurement. </p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>The rationale to select a set of vaccines reflects the ability of "
"immunization programmes to deliver vaccines over the life cycle and to adapt "
"new vaccines. Coverage for other WHO recommended vaccines are also available "
"and can be provided.</p>\n"
"<p>Given that HPV vaccine is relatively new and vaccination schedule varies "
"from countries to country coverage estimate will be made for girls "
"vaccinated by ag 15 and at the moment data is limited to very few countries "
"therefore reporting will start later.</p>"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>WHO and UNICEF jointly developed a methodology to estimate national "
"immunization coverage form selected vaccines in 2000. The methodology has "
"been refined and reviewed by expert committees over time. The methodology "
"was published and reference is available under the reference section. "
"Estimates time series for WHO recommended vaccines produced and published "
"annually since 2001. The methodology uses data reported by national "
"authorities from countries administrative systems as well as data from "
"immunization or multi indicator household surveys. </p>"

"introduction. When country data are not available interpolation is used "
