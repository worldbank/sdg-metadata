"technical rigour, country ownership and use of official data and statistics. "
"The consultation process solicited feedback directly from National "

"data sources used, and the application of internationally agreed "
"definitions, classification and methodologies to the data from that source. "

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Marriage before the age of 18 is a fundamental violation of human rights. "
"Child marriage often compromises a girl&#x2019;s development by resulting in "
"early pregnancy and social isolation, interrupting her schooling, limiting "
"her opportunities for career and vocational advancement and placing her at "
"increased risk of intimate partner violence. In many cultures, girls "
"reaching puberty are expected to assume gender roles associated with "
"womanhood. These include entering a union and becoming a mother. </p>\n"
"<p>The practice of early/child marriage is a direct manifestation of gender "
"inequality. </p>\n"
"<p>The issue of child marriage is addressed in a number of international "
"conventions and agreements. Although marriage is not mentioned directly in "
"the Convention on the Rights of the Child, child marriage is linked to other "
"rights &#x2013; such as the right to freedom of expression, the right to "
"protection from all forms of abuse, and the right to be protected from "
"harmful traditional practices.</p>"

"headquarters to check for consistency and overall data quality. This review "
"is based on a set of objective criteria to ensure that only the most recent "
"and reliable information are included in the databases. These criteria "
"include the following: data sources must include proper documentation; data "
"values must be representative at the national population level; data are "
"collected using an appropriate methodology (e.g., sampling); data values are "
"based on a sufficiently large sample; data conform to the standard indicator "
"definition including age group and concepts, to the extent possible; data "
"are plausible based on trends and consistency with previously published/"
"reported estimates for the indicator. </p>\n"
