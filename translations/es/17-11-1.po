"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator proposed allows tracking the increase of exports from "
"Developing countries and LDCs prescribed by target 17.11. Using shares of "
"global exports provide information on the relative size of Developing and "
"LDCs export in comparison to global exports.</p>"

msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>Export shares need to be analysed from different angles in order to infer "
"whether a particular country or region made improvements in its trade "
"performance. First of all, exports value should be always kept into account "
"in order to observe whether changes in export shares are originating from "
"increasing developing and LDCs exports or from a decrease of other countries "
"exported values. Secondly, and in order to foster trade that is beneficial "
"for the other SDGs, it would be useful to analyze the composition of the "
"export basket by the level of processing of the goods that are traded. This "
"will allow understanding whether progress are made in terms of the quality "
"and value added of the products exported. In addition to that, while some "
"exports like arms, oil and other natural resources would require a separate "
"analysis, the calculation of export diversification indicators would be "
"recommended to assess the progress made by developing and LDCs in terms of "
"productivity and improvement of their export portfolio.</p>\n"
"<p>For what concerns trade in services, it could be necessary to draw on "
"supplementary data from migration, tourism, multinational companies (MNC) "
"and labour market statistics, in order to provide detailed figures for "
"Travel and Government services n.i.e. A typical area of interest for "
"international trade in services relates to the data that may be maintained "
"by governments on education and health services provided to or by non-"
"residents (travel; personal, cultural and recreational services). "
"Information obtained from partner countries is useful in order to validate "
"and improve statistics of the compiling economy. Data from international "
"organizations can be useful for aid recipient countries to compile data on "
"technical assistance services.</p>"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>Share of global trade is intended of a particular group of country "
"fraction of total trade.</p>\n"
"<p>While for merchandise trade data are consistent through he time series "
"(2000-current), for services trade there might be difficulties related to "
"lack of harmonization for data previous to 2005. Before 2005 data are "
"reported according the 5th Balance of Payments Manual. After 2005, data have "
"been converted according to the categories and principles established by the "
"6th edition of the Balance of Payments Manual.</p>"

"<p>Previous year is used when latest year is not available. Alternatively "
"mirror statistics can be used. Mirror statistics is the term used to define "
"statistics that are calculated using partner country information when data "
"for the analysed country are not available. For instance, the export of a "
"country X could be recalculated using mirror statistics through the imports "
"from country X of all its partners. It has to be kept in mind however "
"imports are often reported CIF (i.e. including the cost of freight and "
"insurance) while export FoB (i.e. free on board). The difference between "
"these two reporting systems should be taken into account when using import "
"data to estimate exports.</p>\n"
