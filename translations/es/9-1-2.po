"<h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>\n"
"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>Passenger and freight volumes are respectively measured in passenger-km "
"and tonne-km, and broken down by mode of transport. For the purposes of "
"monitoring this indicator, passenger-km data are split between aviation, "
"road (broken down between passenger cars, buses and motorcycles) and rail, "
"and tonne-km are split between aviation, road, rail and inland waterways. </"
"p>\n"
"<p>As maritime data are not widely available, only tonnes (rather than tonne-"
"km) data at the regional level have been shared.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p><strong>Aviation:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) through its "
"Statistics Division have established standard methodologies and definitions "
"to collect and report traffic (passenger and freight volume) data related to "
"air transport. These standards and methodologies have been adopted by the "
"191 Member States of ICAO and also by the Industry stakeholders i.e. air "
"carriers and airports. The data of ICAO is used by States and also the World "
"Bank for its development indicators. ICAO uses Air Transport Reporting Forms "
"A, AS, B and C to arrive at the passenger and freight volumes for air "
"transport.</p>\n"
"<p>Precise definition of all different concepts and metadata related to Air "
"Transport Reporting Forms A, AS, B and C to arrive at the passenger and "
"freight volumes for air transport. approved by the ICAO Statistics Division "
"and Member States can be found at the ICAO website given below -</p>\n"

"\">http://www.icao.int/sustainability/pages/eap-sta-excel.aspx/.</a></p>\n"
"<p><strong>Road, Rail, Inland waterways, Pipelines</strong></p>\n"
"<p>The ITF and UNECE, in collaboration with Eurostat, collect data on rail "
"and road, inland waterway and pipeline statistics on an annual basis from "
"all their collective Member countries. Data are collected from Transport "
"Ministries, statistical offices and other institution designated as official "
"data source. Although there are clear definitions for all the terms used in "
"this survey, countries might have different methodologies to calculate tonne-"
"kilometres and passenger-kilometres. Methods could be based on traffic or "
"mobility surveys, use very different sampling methods and estimating "
"techniques which could affect the comparability of their statistics. </p>\n"
"<p>Official statistics for road, rail, inland waterways and pipeline "
"transport are only available for UNECE or ITF member States. Data for these "
"modes for other countries come from the ITF&#x2019;s global transport model."
"</p>\n"
"<p>For definitions of all relevant terms, the UNECE/ITF/Eurostat Glossary "
"for Transport Statistics can be consulted. The 5<sup>th</sup> edition of "

"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, "
"including regional and trans-border infrastructure, to support economic "
"development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable "
"access for all. Trans-border infrastructure development is best captured by "
"passenger and freight volumes moved by Member States and Regions. A growth "
"in passenger and freight volumes shows a robust infrastructure development "
"happening in States and Regions along with the resultant socio-economic "
"benefit. Air Transport is particularly important not only for the economic "
"and job benefits but also because it is one of the only mode of transport "
"that can be relied on during emergencies and disease outbreaks to reach "
"food, medicines, medical personnel, vaccines and other supplies speedily to "
"the affected persons in the affected areas. In addition, tracking how the "
"non-road share of freight volumes, and the public transport share of "
"passenger volumes, changes over time allows insights into the overall "
"sustainability of the global transport system.</p>"

"Transport Statistics.</p>\n"
"<p>A common problem for many countries is that passenger-km are only "
