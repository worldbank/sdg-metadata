"<p>Percentage of children and young people in Grade 2 or 3 of primary "
"education, at the end of primary education and the end of lower secondary "
"education achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (a) reading and "
"(b) mathematics. The minimum proficiency level will be measured relative to "
"new common reading and mathematics scales currently in development.</p>\n"
"<h2><strong><strong>Concepts:</strong></strong></h2>\n"
"<p>Minimum proficiency level is the benchmark of basic knowledge in a domain "
"(mathematics or reading) measured through learning assessments. For example, "
"the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) reading test has "
"six proficiency levels, of which Level 2 is described as the minimum "
"proficiency level. In Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study "
"(TIMSS) and Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), there "
"are four proficiency levels: Low, Intermediate, High and Advanced. Students "
"reaching the Intermediate benchmark are able to apply basic knowledge in a "
"variety of situations, similar to the idea of minimum proficiency. "
"Currently, there are no common standards validated by the international "
"community or countries. The indicator shows data published by each of the "
"agencies and organizations specialised in cross-national learning "

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2><strong><strong>Rationale:</strong></strong></h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator is a direct measure of the learning outcomes achieved in "
"the two subject areas at the end of the relevant stages of education. The "
"three measurement points will have their own established minimum standard. "
"There is only one threshold that divides students into above and below "
"minimum: </p>\n"
"<ol>\n"
"  <li>Below minimum is the proportion or percentage of students who do not "
"achieve a minimum standard as set up by countries according to the globally-"
"defined minimum competencies.</li>\n"
"  <li>Above minimum is the proportion or percentage of students who have "
"achieved the minimum standards. Due to heterogeneity of performance levels "
"set by national and cross-national assessments, these performance levels "
"will have to be mapped to the globally-defined minimum performance levels. "
"Once the performance levels are mapped, the global education community will "
"be able to identify for each country the proportion or percentage of "
"children who achieved minimum standards.</li>\n"
"</ol>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2><strong><strong>Comments and limitations:</strong></strong></h2>\n"
"<p>While data from many national assessments are available now, every "
"country sets its own standards so the performance levels might not be "
"comparable. One option is to link existing regional assessments based on a "
"common framework. Furthermore, assessments are typically administered within "
"school systems, the current indicators cover only those in school and the "
"proportion of in-school target populations might vary from country to "
"country due to varied out-of-school children populations. Assessing "
"competencies of children and young people who are out of school would "
"require household-based surveys. Assessing children in households is under "
"consideration but may be very costly and difficult to administer and "
"unlikely to be available on the scale needed within the next 3-5 years. "
"Finally, the calculation of this indicator requires specific information on "
"the ages of children participating in assessments to create globally-"
"comparable data. The ages of children reported by the head of the household "
"might not be consistent and reliable so the calculation of the indicator may "
"be even more challenging. Due to the complication in assessing out-of-school "
"children and the main focus on improving education system, the UIS is taking "
"a stepping stone approach. It will concentrate on assessing children in "
"school in the medium term, where much data are available, then develop more "
"coherent implementation plan to assess out-of-school children in the longer "
"term.</p>"

"<p>Performance above the minimum level, PLtn,s, above minimum = p</p>\n"
"<p>where p is the percentage of students in a learning assessment at stage "
"of education n, in subject s in any year (t-i) where 0 ? i ? 5, who has "
"achieved the level of proficiency that is greater than a pre-defined minimum "
"standard, Smin. The minimum standard is defined by the global education "
"community taking into consideration regional differences.</p>"
