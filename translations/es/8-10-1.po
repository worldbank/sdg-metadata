"branches is scaled per 100,00 adults.</p>\n"
"<p>The number of automated teller machines (ATMs) per 100,000 adults, refers "
"to the number of ATMs in the country for all types of financial institutions "
"such as: commercial banks, non-deposit taking microfinance institutions, "
"deposit taking micro finance institutions, credit union and financial "
"cooperatives, among other. This information is reported every year by the "

"<p>Access to and use of formal financial services is essential. Services "

"their overall welfare. As banks remain one of the key institutions for "
"access to formal financial services, having an accessible bank branch is an "
"important initial point of access to financial services and therefore use of "
"them. Bank branches are complemented by other important points of access "
"such as automated teller machines of all formal financial institutions, "
