msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The safeguard of important sites is vital for stemming the decline in "
"biodiversity and ensuring long term and sustainable use of mountain natural "
"resources. The establishment of protected areas is an important mechanism "
"for achieving this aim, and this indicator serves as a means of measuring "
"progress toward the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of "
"mountain ecosystems and their services, in line with obligations under "
"international agreements. Importantly, while it can be disaggregated to "
"report on any given single ecosystem of interest, it is not restricted to "
"any single ecosystem type, and so faithfully reflects the intent of SDG "
"target 15.1.</p>\n"
"<p>Levels of access to protected areas vary among the protected area "
"management categories. Some areas, such as scientific reserves, are "
"maintained in their natural state and closed to any other use. Others are "
"used for recreation or tourism, or even open for the sustainable extraction "
"of natural resources. In addition to protecting biodiversity, protected "
"areas have high social and economic value: supporting local livelihoods; "
"protecting watersheds from erosion; harbouring an untold wealth of genetic "
"resources; supporting thriving recreation and tourism industries; providing "
"for science, research and education; and forming a basis for cultural and "
"other non-material values.</p>\n"
"<p>This indicator adds meaningful information to, complements and builds "
"from traditionally reported simple statistics of mountain area covered by "
"protected areas, computed by dividing the total protected area within a "
"country by the total territorial area of the country and multiplying by 100 "
"(e.g., Chape et al. 2005). Such percentage area coverage statistics do not "
"recognise the extreme variation of biodiversity importance over space "
"(Rodrigues et al. 2004), and so risk generating perverse outcomes through "
"the protection of areas which are large at the expense of those which "
"require protection.</p>\n"
"<p>The indicator is used to track progress towards the 2011&#x2013;2020 "
"Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014), and was "
"used as an indicator towards the Convention on Biological Diversity&#x2019;s "
"2010 Target (Butchart et al. 2010)</p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>Quality control criteria are applied to ensure consistency and "
"comparability of the data in the World Database on Protected Areas. New data "
"are validated at UNEP-WCMC through a number of tools and translated into the "
"standard data structure of the World Database on Protected Areas. "
"Discrepancies between the data in the World Database on Protected Areas and "
"new data are minimised by provision of a manual (UNEP-WCMC 2019) and "
"resolved in communication with data providers. Similar processes apply for "
"the incorporation of data into the <em>World Database of Key Biodiversity "
"Areas</em> (BirdLife International 2019).</p>\n"
"<p>The indicator does not measure the effectiveness of protected areas in "
"reducing biodiversity loss, which ultimately depends on a range of "
"management and enforcement factors not covered by the indicator. A number of "
"initiatives are underway to address this limitation. Most notably, numerous "
"mechanisms have been developed for assessment of protected area management, "
"which can be synthesised into an indicator (Leverington et al. 2010). This "
"is used by the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership as a complementary "
"indicator of progress towards Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 (<a href=\"http://"
"www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement\">http://www.bipindicators.net/"
"pamanagement</a>). However, there may be little relationship between these "
"measures and protected area outcomes (Nolte &amp; Agrawal 2013). More "
"recently, approaches to &#x201C;green listing&#x201D; have started to be "
"developed, to incorporate both management effectiveness and the outcomes of "
"protected areas, and these are likely to become progressively important as "
"they are tested and applied more broadly.</p>\n"
"<p>Data and knowledge gaps can arise due to difficulties in determining "
"whether a site conforms to the IUCN definition of a protected area, and some "
"protected areas are not assigned management categories. Moreover, &#x201C;"
"other effective area-based conservation measures&#x201D;, as specified by "
"Aichi Biodiversity Target </p>\n"
"<p>11 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011&#x2013;2020, recognise "
"that some sites beyond the formal protected area network, while not managed "
"primarily for nature conservation, may nevertheless be managed in ways which "
"are consistent with the persistence of the biodiversity for which they are "
"important (Jonas et al. 2014). However, the formally agreed definition of an "
"OECM (&#x201C;A geographically defined area other than a Protected Area, "
"which is governed and managed in ways that achieve positive and sustained "
"long-term outcomes for the in situ conservation of biodiversity, with "
"associated ecosystem functions and services and, where applicable, cultural, "
"spiritual, socioeconomic, and other locally relevant values&#x201D;) were "
"only agreed in November 2018 and measures are only recently in place for "
"countries to submit OECM data to UNEP-WCMC. OECMs are now collated by UNEP-"
"WCMC in a separate database, the WD-OECM.</p>\n"
"<p>Regarding important sites, the biggest limitation is that site "
"identification to date has focused mainly on specific subsets of "
"biodiversity, for example birds (for Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas) "
"and highly threatened species (for Alliance for Zero Extinction sites). "
"While Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas have been documented to be good "
"surrogates for biodiversity more generally (Brooks et al. 2001, Pain et al. "
"2005), the application of the unified standard for identification of Key "
"Biodiversity Areas (IUCN 2016) sites across different levels of biodiversity "
"(genes, species, ecosystems) and different taxonomic groups remains a high "
"priority, building from efforts to date (Eken et al. 2004, Knight et al. "
"2007, Langhammer et al. 2007, Foster et al. 2012). Birds now comprise "
"&lt;50% of the species for which Key Biodiversity Areas have been "
"identified, and as Key Biodiversity Area identification for other taxa and "
"elements of biodiversity proceeds, such bias will become a less important "
"consideration in the future.</p>\n"
"<p>Key Biodiversity Area identification has been validated for a number of "
"countries and regions where comprehensive biodiversity data allow formal "
"calculation of the site importance (or &#x201C;irreplaceability&#x201D;) "
"using systematic conservation planning techniques (Di Marco et al. 2016, "
"Montesino Pouzols et al. 2014).</p>\n"
"<p>Future developments of the indicator will include: a) expansion of the "
"taxonomic coverage of mountain Key Biodiversity Areas through application of "
"the Key Biodiversity Areas standard (IUCN 2016) to a wide variety of "
"mountain vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and ecosystem type; b) "
"improvements in the data on protected areas by continuing to increase the "
"proportion of sites with documented dates of designation and with digitised "
"boundary polygons (rather than coordinates).</p>"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>This indicator is calculated from data derived from a spatial overlap "
"between digital polygons for protected areas from the World Database on "
"Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC &amp; IUCN 2020) and digital polygons for "
"mountain Key Biodiversity Areas (from the World Database of Key Biodiversity "
"Areas, including Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas, Alliance for Zero "
"Extinction sites, and other Key Biodiversity Areas). Sites were classified "
"as mountain Key Biodiversity Areas by undertaking a spatial overlap between "
"the Key Biodiversity Area polygons and a mountain raster layer (UNEP-WCMC "
"2002), classifying any Key Biodiversity Area as a mountain Key Biodiversity "
"Area where it had &#x2265;5% overlap with the mountain layer. The value of "
"the indicator at a given point in time, based on data on the year of "
"protected area establishment recorded in the World Database on Protected "
"Areas, is computed as the mean percentage of each Key Biodiversity Area "
"currently recognised that is covered by protected areas.</p>\n"
"<p>Year of protected area establishment is unknown for ~12% of protected "
"areas in the World Database on Protected Areas, generating uncertainty "
"around changing protected area coverage over time. To reflect this "
"uncertainty, a year was randomly assigned from another protected area within "
"the same country, and then this procedure repeated 1000 times, with the "
"median plotted. </p>\n"
"<p>Prior to 2017, the indicator was presented as the percentage of Key "
"Biodiversity Areas completely covered by protected areas. However, it is now "
"presented as the mean % of each Key Biodiversity Area that is covered by "
"protected areas in order to better reflect trends in protected area coverage "
"for countries or regions with few or no Key Biodiversity Areas that are "
"completely covered.</p>"

"1990, 1993, 1997, 2003, 2014 and 2018 which have resulted in a global "

"<p>~150 years </p>\n"
"<h2>Disaggregation:</h2>\n"
"<p>Given that data for the global indicator are compiled at national levels, "
"it is straightforward to disaggregate to national and regional levels (e.g., "
"Han et al. 2014), or conversely to aggregate to the global level. Key "
"Biodiversity Areas span all ecosystem types, including mountains (Rodr&#xED;"
"guez-Rodr&#xED;guez et al. 2011). The indicator can therefore be reported in "
"combination across terrestrial and freshwater systems, or disaggregated "
"among them. However, individual Key Biodiversity Areas can encompass "
"terrestrial and freshwater (and indeed marine) systems simultaneously, and "
"so determining the results is not simply additive. Finally, the indicator "
"can be disaggregated according to different protected area management "
"categories (categories I&#x2013;VI) to reflect differing specific management "
"objectives of protected areas.</p>\n"
"<p>In addition to the aggregation of the coverage of protected areas across "
"important sites for mountain biodiversity as an indicator towards SDG 15.4, "
"other disaggregations of coverage of protected areas of particular relevance "
"as indicators towards SDG targets (Brooks et al. 2016) include:</p>\n"
"<p>SDG 14.5.1 Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas.</p>\n"
"<p>SDG 15.1.2 Proportion of important sites for terrestrial and freshwater "
"biodiversity that are covered by protected areas, by ecosystem type.</p>\n"
"<p>Protected area coverage data can be combined with other data sources to "
"yield further, complementary, indicators. For example, protected area "
"overlay with ecoregional maps can be used to provide information on "
"protected area coverage of different broad biogeographical regions. "
"Protected area coverage of the distributions of different groups of species "
"(e.g., mammals, birds, amphibians) can similarly provide indicators of "
"trends in coverage of biodiversity at the species level. Protected area "
"coverage can be combined with the Red List Index to generate indicators of "
"the impacts of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss (Butchart et "
"al. 2012). Finally, indicators derived from protected area overlay can also "
"inform sustainable urban development; for example, the overlay of protected "
"areas onto urban maps could provide an indicator of public space as a "
"proportion of overall city space.</p>"

"<h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>\n"
"<p>National processes provide the great bulk of the data that are "
"subsequently aggregated into both the World Database on Protected Areas and "
"the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, and so there are very few "
"differences between national indicators and the global one. One minor source "
"of difference is that the World Database on Protected Areas incorporates "
"internationally-designated protected areas (e.g., World Heritage sites, "
"Ramsar sites, etc), a few of which are not considered by their sovereign "
"nations to be protected areas. </p>\n"
"<p>Note that because countries do not submit comprehensive data on "
"degazetted protected areas to the WDPA, earlier values of the indictor may "
"marginally underestimate coverage. Furthermore, there is also a lag between "
"the point at which a protected area is designated on the ground and the "
"point at which it is reported to the WDPA. As such, current or recent "
"coverage may also be underestimated.</p>"
