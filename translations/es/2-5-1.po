"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>The conservation of plant and animal genetic resources for food and "
"agriculture (GRFA) in medium or long term conservation facilities (<em>ex "
"situ</em>, in genebanks) represents the most trusted means of conserving "
"genetic resources worldwide. Plant and animal GRFA conserved in these "
"facilities can be easily used in breeding programmes as well, even directly "
"on-farm.</p>\n"
"<p>The measure of trends in <em>ex situ</em> conserved materials provides an "
"overall assessment of the extent to which we are managing to maintain and/or "
"increase the total genetic diversity available for future use and thus "
"protected from any permanent loss of genetic diversity which may occur in "
"the natural habitat, i.e. <em>in situ</em>, or on-farm.</p>\n"
"<p>The two components of the indicator, plant and animal GRFA, are "
"separately counted.</p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Plant genetic resources </em></strong></p>\n"
"<p>The plant component is calculated as the number of accessions of plant "
"genetic resources secured in conservation facilities under medium or long "
"term conditions, where an &#x2018;accession&#x2019; is defined as a distinct "
"sample of seeds, planting materials or plants which is maintained in a "
"genebank. Genebank Standards for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and "

"collection with an amount of genetic material stored which is required to "
"reconstitute the breed in case of extinction (further information on &#x201C;"

"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Plant genetic resources</em></strong></p>\n"
"<p><em>Plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (PGRFA):</em> Any "
"genetic material of plant origin of actual or potential value for food and "
"agriculture.</p>\n"
"<p><em>Accession:</em> An accession is defined as a sample of seeds, "
"planting materials or plants representing either a wild population, a "
"landrace, a breeding line or an improved cultivar, which is conserved in a "
"genebank. Each accession should be distinct and, in terms of genetic "
"integrity, as close as possible to the sample provided originally.</p>\n"
"<p><em>Base collection:</em> A base collection is defined as a set of unique "
"accessions to be preserved for a medium to long-term period.</p>\n"
"<p><em>Active collection:</em> An active collection is defined as a set of "
"distinct accessions that is used for regeneration, multiplication, "
"distribution, characterization and evaluation. Active collections are "
"maintained in short to medium-term storage and usually duplicated in a base "
"collection. </p>\n"
"<p><em>Medium or long term conservation facilities:</em> Biological "
"diversity is often conserved <em>ex situ</em>, outside its natural habitat, "
"in facilities called genebanks. In the case of plant genetic resources, "
"genebanks conserve base collections under medium or long term storage "
"conditions, in the form of seeds in cold rooms, plants in the field and "
"tissues <em>in vitro</em> and/or cryoconserved. </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Animal genetic resources</em></strong></p>\n"
"<p><em>Breed:</em> A breed is either a sub-specific group of domestic "
"livestock with definable and identifiable external characteristics that "
"enable it to be separated by visual appraisal from other similarly defined "
"groups within the same species, or a group for which geographical and/or "
"cultural separation from phenotypically similar groups has led to acceptance "
"of its separate identity. </p>\n"
"<p><em>Medium or long term conservation facilities:</em> Biological "
"diversity is often conserved <em>ex situ</em>, outside its natural habitat, "
"in facilities called genebanks. In the case of domestic animal diversity, "
"<em>ex situ</em> conservation includes both the maintenance of live animals "
"(<em>in vivo</em>) and cryoconservation. </p>\n"
"<p><em>Cryoconservation</em> is the collection and deep-freezing of semen, "
"ova, embryos or tissues for potential future use in breeding or regenerating "

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>Genetic resources for food and agriculture provide the building blocks of "
"food security and, directly or indirectly, support the livelihoods of every "
"person on earth. As the conservation and accessibility to these resources "
"are of vital importance, medium- or long- term conservation facilities "
"(genebanks) to preserve and make these resources and their associated "
"information accessible for breeding and research have been established at "
"country, regional and global levels. Inventories of genebank holdings "
"provide a dynamic measure of the existing plant and animal diversity and its "
"level of preservation. Data relevant to this indicator facilitate the "
"monitoring of diversity secured and accessible through genebanks and support "
"the development and updating of strategies for the conservation and "
"sustainable use of genetic resources.</p>\n"
"<p>The indicator is related to a monitoring framework endorsed by the FAO "
"Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture in which the status "
"and trends of plant and animal genetic resources are described through "
"globally agreed indicators and regular country-driven assessments. </p>\n"
"<p>The number of materials conserved under medium- or long-term storage "
"conditions provides an indirect measurement of the total genetic diversity, "
"which are managed to secure for future use. Overall, positive variations are "
"therefore approximated to an increase in the agro-biodiversity secured, "
"while negative variations to a loss of it. </p>\n"
"<p>Caution needs to be paid in the reporting and interpretation of the "
"indicator. In the case of plant genetic resources, an uncontrolled addition "
"of accessions that are in fact duplicates of samples already conserved and "
"accounted for, or, <em>vice versa</em>, the deletion from the reported "
"collections of redundant duplicates may lead to wrong interpretations. In "
"order to avoid duplicate counting at the national level, primarily base "
"collections should be reported. An active collection could be reported, only "
"when, in the absence of a base collection, it also serves the function of "
"the base collection. Another example that needs to be monitored both while "
"reporting and interpreting the results include the grouping or splitting of "
"accessions, as in both cases the variation in the accounted number does not "
"reflect a variation in the genetic diversity conserved and secured. "
"Therefore, it is crucial that reporting countries and regional/international "
"centres together with the accession level information requested explain also "
"the reason for the decrease or increase in the number of accessions, in "
"particular when this does not reflect a real loss or gain in the genetic "
"diversity conserved and secured.</p>"

"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Plant genetic resources</em></strong></p>\n"
"<p>Broadly, two issues are of concern in using the &#x201C;number of "
"accessions&#x201D; as an indicator of diversity in <em>ex situ</em> "
"collections:</p>\n"
"<p>Undetected duplicates of accessions may contribute to an increase of the "
"indicator, as each accession is a managed unit, kept and recorded as "
"distinct. The detection of such duplicates will therefore result in a "
"reduction in the number of accession previously reported. This can occur at "
"different levels, for example within genebank collections and also at "
"international level.</p>\n"
"<p>A loss of viability of the material(s) conserved that is not promptly "
"detected may similarly not be reflected in the number of accessions, "
"contributing to an overestimate of the actual number of accessions.</p>\n"
"<p>Additional information could be provided by other indicators measuring "
"<em>ex situ</em> conservation, which are part of the monitoring of the "
"implementation of the Global Plan of Action for PGRFA under the FAO "
"Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. </p>\n"
