"<p>Prevalence of wasting (weight for height &lt;-2 standard deviation from "
"the median of the World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards) "
"among children under 5 years of age.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>The official MDG indicator is wasting as assessed using weight for "
"height. Wasting can however also be assessed with mid upper arm "
"circumference (MUAC). Estimates of wasting based on MUAC are not considered "
"for the joint dataset. In addition, while wasting constitutes the major form "
"of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM), there are acutely malnourished "
"children who would not be picked up with weight-for-height or MUAC, namely "
"those presenting bilateral pitting odema (characterized by swollen feet, "
"face and limbs). For Surveys that report oedema cases, in the joint data set "
"these are included in the prevalence of low weight-for-height. </p>"

"<h1>Data sources</h1>\n"
"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>For the majority of countries, nationally representative household "
"surveys constitute the data source. For a limited number of countries data "
"from surveillance systems is used if sufficient population coverage is "
"documented (about 80%). For both data sources, the child&#x2019;s height and "
"weight measurements have to be collected following recommended standard "
"measuring techniques (WHO 2008). </p>"

msgctxt "COLL_METHOD"
msgid ""
"<h2>Collection process:</h2>\n"
"<p>UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank group jointly review new data sources to "
"update the country level estimates. Each agency uses their existing "
"mechanisms for obtaining data.</p>\n"
"<p>For WHO, see published database methodology (de Onis et al. 2004). For "
"UNICEF, the cadre of dedicated data and monitoring specialists working at "
"national, regional and international levels in 190 countries routinely "
"provide technical support for the collection and analysis of data. For the "
"past 20 years UNICEF has undertaken an annual process to update its global "
"databases, called Country Reporting on Indicators for Goals (CRING). This "
"exercise is done in close collaboration with UNICEF country offices with the "
"purpose of ensuring that UNICEF global databases contain updated and "
"internationally comparable data. UNICEF country offices are invited to "
"submit, through an online system, nationally representative data for over "
"100 key indicators on the well-being of women and children, including "
"stunting. The country office staff work with local counterparts to ensure "
"the most relevant data are shared. Updates sent by the country offices are "
"then reviewed by sector specialists at UNICEF headquarters to check for "
"consistency and overall data quality of the submitted estimates and re-"
"analysis where possible. This review is based on a set of objective criteria "
"to ensure that only the most reliable information is included in the "
"databases. Once reviewed, feedback is made available on whether or not "
"specific data points are accepted, and if not, the reasons why. UNICEF uses "
"these data obtained through CRING to feed into the joint dataset. The World "
"Bank Group provides estimates available through the Living Standard "
"Measurement Surveys (LSMS) which usually requires re-analysis of datasets "
"given that the LSMS reports often do not tabulate the stunting data. </p>"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Child growth is an internationally accepted outcome reflecting child "
"nutritional status. Child wasting refers to a child who is too thin for his "
"or her height and is the result of recent rapid weight loss or the failure "
"to gain weight. A child who is moderately or severely wasted has an "
"increased risk of death, but treatment is possible. Child wasting is one of "
"the World Health Assembly nutrition target indicators.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>Survey estimates come with levels of uncertainty due to both sampling "
"error and non-sampling error (e.g. mesasurement technical error, recording "
"error etc.,). None of the two sources of errros have been fully taken into "
"account for deriving estimates neither at country nor at regional and global "
"levels. Surveys are carried out in a specific period of the year, usually "
"over a few months. However, this indicator can be affected by seasonality, "
"factors related to food availability (e.g. pre-harvest periods), disease (e."
"g. rainy season and diarrhoea, malaria, etc.), and natural disasters and "
"conflicts. Hence, country-year estimates may not necessarily be comparable "
"over time. Consequently, only latest estimates are provided. </p>"

"<h1>Data availability</h1>\n"
"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>More than 150 countries.</p>\n"
"<h2>Time series:</h2>\n"
"<p>At country level, data are provided for the years where surveys are "
"included in the joint dataset. Survey years range from 1983 to 2016. For the "
"global and regional levels, estimates are provided only for the latest "
"available estimate upon release each year (i.e. in Sept 2016 edition of the "
"Joint Malnutrition Estimates the only estimate available for was for 2015 "
"and no time series were provided). </p>\n"
"<h2>Disaggregation:</h2>\n"
"<p>Global and regional estimates refer to the age group of children under 5 "
"years, sexes combined. Disaggregated country data are available in a "
"majority of household surveys and UNICEF-WHO-The World Bank Group are "
"expanding the joint data set to include sub national and stratified "
"estimates (e.g. sex, age groups, wealth, mothers&apos; education, residence) "
"in 2017.</p>"

msgctxt "COMPARABILITY"
msgid ""
"<h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>\n"
"<p>The standard analysis approach to construct the joint data set aims for a "
"maximum comparability of country estimates. For the inclusion of survey "
"estimates into the JME dataset, the inter-agency group applies survey "
"quality assessment criteria. When there is insufficient documentation, the "
"survey is not included until information becomes available. When raw data "
"are available, and there is a question about the analysis approach, data re-"
"analysis is performed following the standard methodology. Discrepancies "
"between results from standardised approach and those reported may occur for "
"various reasons, for example, the use of different standards for z-score "
"calculations, imputation of the day of birth when missing, the use of "
"rounded age in months, the use of different flagging systems for data "
"exclusion. For surveys based on the previous NCHS/WHO references, and for "
"which raw data are not available, a method for converting the z-scores to be "
"based on the WHO Child Growth Standards is applied (Yang and de Onis, 2008). "
"In addition, when surveys do not cover the age interval 0-&lt;5 years, or "
"are only representative of the rural areas, an adjustment based on other "
"surveys for the same country, is performed. Any adjustment or conversion is "
"transparently stated in the annotated joint data set.</p>"
