"<p>Carbon dioxide (here after, CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions per unit value "
"added is an indicator computed as ratio between CO<sub>2</sub> emissions "
"from fuel combustion and the value added of associated economic activities. "
"The indicator can be computed for the whole economy (total CO<sub>2</sub> "
"emissions/GDP) or for specific sectors, notably the manufacturing sector "
"(CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from manufacturing industries per manufacturing "
"value added (MVA). </p>\n"
"<p>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per unit of GDP are expressed in kilogrammes of "
"CO<sub>2</sub> per USD constant 2010 PPP GDP. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from "
"manufacturing industries per unit of MVA are measured in kilogrammes of "
"CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per unit of MVA in constant 2015 USD.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>Total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for an economy are estimated based on "

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator CO2 emissions per unit of value added represents the amount "
"of emissions from fuel combustion produced by an economic activity, per unit "
"of economic output. When computed for the whole economy, it combines effects "
"of the average carbon intensity of the energy mix (linked to the shares of "
"the various fossil fuels in the total); of the structure of an economy "
"(linked to the relative weight of more or less energy-intensive sectors); of "
"the average efficiency in the use of energy. When computed for the "
"manufacturing sector (CO2 emissions from fuel combustion per unit of "
"manufacturing value added), it measures the carbon intensity of the "
"manufacturing economic output, and its trends result from changes in the "
"average carbon intensity of the energy mix used, in the structure of the "
"manufacturing sector, in the energy efficiency of production technologies in "
"each sub-sector, and in the economic value of the various output. "
"Manufacturing industries are generally improving their emission intensity as "
"countries move to higher levels of industrialization, but it should be noted "
"that emission intensities can also be reduced through structural changes and "
"product diversification in manufacturing. </p>\n"
"<p>CO<sub>2</sub> emission accounts for around 80% of all GHG emission from "
"the manufacturing processes. </p>"

"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>Estimation of CO<sub>2</sub> emission data is not systematized in many "
"countries, although is performed internationally based on harmonised energy "
"data collected at national level. Energy data collection is generally well "
"established, although in some cases national methodologies may differ from "
"internationally agreed methodologies. National data sources include "
"statistical offices, Energy Ministries, Environment agencies, among others. "

"<h2>Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the "

"<p>It is important that energy data collection and emissions calculations "
"are consistent with international standards. CO2 emissions need to be "
"estimated based on energy data and on internationally agreed methodologies. "
"Energy data are collected at a country level, based on internationally "
"agreed standards (UN International Recommendations on Energy Statistics). "
"The IEA collects from countries energy data, according to internationally "
"agreed energy statistics definitions. Then, the IEA estimates CO2 emissions "
"based on country data and on the IPCC Guidelines for GHG inventories, "
"producing internationally comparable CO2 emissions data for over 150 "
"countries and regions. For energy data: the IEA sends standardised energy "
"questionnaires (by fuel) to its Members and more globally to countries "
"willing to provide data (e.g. all EU - jointly with Eurostat- most UNECE "
"countries, and a few others submit these questionnaires). Questionnaires are "
"available at: <a href=\"http://www.iea.org/statistics/resources/"
"questionnaires/annual/\">http://www.iea.org/statistics/resources/"
"questionnaires/annual/</a>. For other countries, national data are processed "
"to a consistent format. Therefore, the IEA is able to provide key energy "
"statistics. More detail on methods and sources is available at: <a href="
