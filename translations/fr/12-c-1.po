"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>In order to measure fossil fuel subsidies at the national, regional and "
"global level, three sub-indicators are recommended for reporting on this "
"indicator: 1) direct transfer of government funds; 2) induced transfers "
"(price support); and as an optional sub-indicator 3) tax expenditure, other "
"revenue foregone, and under-pricing of goods and services. The definitions "
"of the IEA Statistical Manual (IEA, 2005) and the Agreement on Subsidies and "
"Countervailing Measures (ASCM) under the World Trade Organization (WTO) "
"(WTO, 1994) are used to define fossil fuel subsidies. Standardised "
"descriptions from the United Nations Statistical Office&#x2019;s Central "
"Product Classification should be used to classify individual energy "
"products. It is proposed to drop the wording &#x201C;as a proportion of "
"total national expenditure on fossil fuels&#x201D; and thus this indicator "
"is effectively &quot;Amount of fossil fuel subsidies per unit of GDP "
"(production and consumption)&quot;.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>The concepts and definitions used in the methodology have been based on "
"existing international frameworks and glossaries.</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>Use definition of fossil fuels from IEA Statistics Manual, &#x201C;"
"Fossil fuels are taken from natural resources which were formed from biomass "
"in the geological past. By extension, the term fossil is also applied to any "
"secondary fuel manufactured from a fossil fuel.&#x201D;</li>\n"
"  <li>Use the terms set out in CPC Rev. 2.1 for the statistical "
"classification of the individual products. No other commonly accepted "
"definition identified</li>\n"
"  <li>Include electricity and heat generated from fossil fuels in the scope "
"of fossil fuels. </li>\n"
"  <li>Include non-energy uses with monitoring optional for the measuring of "
"this indicator.</li>\n"
"  <li>Additional details are provided in the methodological document "
"entitled, Measuring Fossil Fuel Subsidies in the Context of the Sustainable "
"Development Goals.</li>\n"

"<h1>Data sources</h1>\n"
"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>Direct transfers are generally reported in government budgets, and well "
"documented in sectoral and Finance Ministries, broken down by programme if "
"not by fuel. Those that meet the SNA definition of &#x201C;subsidies&#x201D; "
"&#x2013; i.e., subsidies on products, and other subsidies on production "
"&#x2013; can also be found in a country&#x2019;s System of National "
"Accounts. Budget documents are publicly available for most countries. The "
"degree to which information on individual programmes is itemized in those "
"reports is highly variable, however. Support to corporations involved in "
"energy production or transformation may sometimes be found in their annual "
"reports, for example. In some cases, researchers may be able to obtain "
"unpublished data from state-owned energy enterprises directly.</p>\n"
"<p>Induced transfer are measured by calculating the price-gap between the "
"producer or consumer price and a reference price, and multiplying that "
"differential by the affected volume produced or consumed. </p>\n"
"<p>Measuring the value of special features introduced into the tax code to "
"favour certain industries or activities of those industries (such as "
"investment in productive capital) can be a complex endeavour. Some countries "
"do this exercise already, and report the annual value of those tax features "
"in their periodic tax-expenditure reports. Where that is not the case, the "
"analysist must construct a model and estimate the difference in the revenues "
"that would be owed to the government under the baseline conditions and with "
"the special tax feature.</p>\n"
"<p>Fossil fuel subsidies should be monitored on an annual basis. </p>"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The scale and impact of fossil fuel subsidies presents both challenges "
"and opportunities for achieving the goals of the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable "
"Development. For one, the use of fossil fuels, and their promotion through "
"subsidy schemes, adversely affects the ability of governments to attain key "
"goals, such as reducing poverty, improving health, reaching gender equality, "
"providing access to energy, and addressing climate change. At the same time, "
"there is a need to ensure that poor households that are particularly "
"vulnerable to price increases obtain or retain access to energy. Energy-"
"dependent sectors of the economy can be affected, particularly by abrupt "
"changes in prices. Any successful reform therefore requires careful analysis "
"and adapted mitigation measures. For another, reallocating fossil fuel "
"subsidies to sectors that are relevant for development could give a boost to "
"reaching the SDGs. </p>\n"
"<p>Awareness and understanding of existing subsidies based on credible data "
"is necessary to increase transparency and inform decision-making. Reporting "
"against a global indicator measuring consumer and producer fossil fuel "
"subsidies provides a global picture that encompasses both consumer and "
"producer subsidies. It allows for tracking of national and global trends and "
"serve as an important guide for policy-making. </p>"

"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>The monitoring and reporting of SDG Indicator 12.c.1 requires capacity "
"within national statistical systems to evaluate direct and indirect "
"transfers of government funds. Data collection by the statistical agencies "
"from the sectoral ministries and state-owned enterprises, including at the "
"sub-national level, which depends on their capacity. There is a need for "
"additional training materials and sharing of experiences on the indicator.</"
"p>\n"
"<p>The indicator methodology utilizes a phased monitoring to allow for "
"countries with different capacities to engage in monitoring 12.c.1. The two "
"phases include global monitoring based on price gap estimates plus national "
"monitoring of direct and indirect transfers with optional monitoring of tax "
"expenditure foregone.</p>"

msgctxt "DATA_COMP"
msgid ""
"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>It is proposed that countries report on the subsidy categories listed "
"below as sub-indicators.</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>Direct transfers; </li>\n"
"  <li>Induced transfers (reporting on regulated prices and calculation of "
"the total amount);</li>\n"
"  <li>Tax expenditure, other government revenue foregone and under-pricing "
"of goods and services, including risk (optional). </li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>The last category should be included as an optional sub-indicator. Each "
"sub-indicator should be expressed in national currency or United States "
"dollars in current prices. UN Environment will use market exchange rates to "
"calculate between national currency and United States dollar. </p>\n"
"<p>Care should be given if a country chooses to aggregate across the three "
"sub-indicators in order to avoid double counting and all three sub-"
"indicators should be publicly available to ensure transparency. Care needs "
"to be taken when aggregating estimates of induced transfers with data on "
"direct transfers and some measures in under-pricing of goods and services. </"
"p>\n"
"<p>Estimates of subsidies to consumers observable through price-gaps (i.e., "
"consumer price support) have been calculated by several international "
"organizations (IADB, IEA, and IMF), covering different geographic regions "
"and time-periods. The three organisations that produce these estimates use "
"roughly the same approach, which can be summed up by the following equation:"
"</p>\n"
"<p>Consumer price support = (adjusted net-of-tax reference unit price "
"&#x2013; local net-of-tax unit price) x units subsidized</p>\n"
"<p>Estimates are based on reference prices on import (or export) parity "
"prices using the price of a product at the nearest international hub, "
"adjusted for quality differences if necessary, plus (or minus) the cost of "
"freight and insurance to the net importer (or back to the net exporter), "
"plus the cost of internal distribution and marketing and any value-added tax "
"(VAT). For tradable commodities (mainly coal, crude oil, and petroleum "
"products), the reference prices are based on the spot price at the nearest "
"international hub &#x2013; e.g., the United States, Northwest Europe, or "
"Singapore.</p>"

"<h1>Data availability</h1>\n"
"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>An initial baseline data assessment of data availability demonstrates "
"that 99 countries have existing data which can be used to estimate fossil "
"fuels from direct transfer and many of these countries also have information "
"on tax revenue foregone. Data on induced transfers using a price gap "
"approach is available for all UN member states.</p>\n"
"<h2>Time series:</h2>\n"
"<p>The reporting on this indicator will follow an annual cycle with initial "
"reporting on induced transfers starting in 2018. Data on direct transfers "
"and tax revenue foregone will be in place by 2020.</p>\n"
"<h2>Disaggregation:</h2>\n"
"<p>Because of the risk of double counting, the dataset should therefore "
"provide disaggregated information on individual subsidy measures that will "
"be reported as sub-indicators by category of subsidies.</p>"
