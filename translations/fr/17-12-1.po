"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>Average import tariffs (in per cent) faced by products exported from "
"developing countries and least developed countries.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>Tariffs: Tariffs are customs duties on merchandise imports, levied either "
"on an ad valorem basis (percentage of value) or on a specific basis (e.g. $7 "
"per 100 kg). Tariffs can be used to create a price advantage for similar "
"locally-produced goods and for raising government revenues. Trade remedy "
"measures and taxes are not considered to be tariffs. Tariff in HS chapters "
"01-97 is taken into consideration.</p>\n"
"<p>Tariff line or National Tariff lines (NTL): National Tariff Line codes "
"refer to the classification codes, applied to merchandise goods by "
"individual countries that are longer than the HS six digit level. Countries "
"are free to introduce national distinctions for tariffs and many other "
"purposes.</p>\n"
"<p>The national tariff line codes are based on the HS system but are longer "
"than six digits. For example, the six digit HS code 010120 refers to Asses, "
"mules and hinnies, live, whereas the US National Tariff line code 010120.10 "
"refers to live purebred breeding asses, 010120.20 refers to live asses other "
"than purebred breeding asses and 010120.30 refers to mules and hinnies "
"imported for immediate slaughter.</p>"

"<h1>Data sources</h1>\n"
"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>The main information used to calculate indicators 17.12.1 is import "
"tariff data. Information on import tariffs might be retrieved by contacting "
"directly National statistical offices, permanent country missions to the UN, "
"regional organizations or focal points within the customs, ministries in "
"charge of customs revenues (Ministry of economy/finance and related revenue "
"authorities) or, alternatively, the Ministry of trade. Tariff data for the "
"calculation of this indicator are retrieved from ITC (MAcMap) - http://www."
"macmap.org/ - WTO (IDB) - http://tao.wto.org - and UNCTAD (TRAINS) "
"databases. Import tariff data included in the ITC (MAcMap) database are "
"collected by contacting directly focal points in line national agencies or "
"regional organizations (in the case of custom unions or regional economic "
"communities). When available, data are downloaded from national or regional "
"official websites. In some cases, data are purchased from private companies. "
"Import tariff data included in the WTO (IDB) database are sourced from "
"official notifications of WTO members. Import tariff included in the UNCTAD "
"(TRAINS) database are collected from official sources, including official "
"country or regional organizations websites.</p>"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The average level of customs tariff rates faced by developing countries "

"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>&quot;The reduction of average tariffs on key sector as agriculture can "
"represent a proxy of the level of commitment of developed country to improve "
"market access conditions.</p>\n"
"<p>In terms of limitations:</p>\n"
"<p>Tariffs are only part of the trade limitation factors to the "
"implementation of duty-free and quota-free market access, especially when "
"looking at exports of developing or least developed countries under non-"
"reciprocal preferential treatment that set criteria for eligibility. "
"Accurate estimates on non-tariff measures do not exist, thus the "
"calculations on market access are limited to tariffs only.</p>\n"
"<p>A full coverage of preferential schemes of developed countries has been "
"used for the computation, but preferential treatment may not be fully used "
"by developing countries&apos; exporters for different reasons such as the "
"inability of certain exporters to meet eligibility criteria (i.e., complying "
"with rules of origin).&quot;</p>"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>Some tariff rates which are not expressed in ad valorem form (e.g., "
"specific duties) need to be converted in ad valorem equivalents (i.e. in per "
"cent of the import value). The conversion is made at the tariff line level "
"for each importer by using the unit value method. Import unit values are "
"calculated from import values and quantities. Only a limited number of non-"
"ad valorem tariff rates (i.e. technical duties) cannot be provided with ad "
"valorem equivalents (AVE) and are excluded from the calculation. This "
"methodology also allows for cross-country comparisons.</p>"
