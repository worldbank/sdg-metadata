msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Population and housing censuses are one of the primary sources of data "
"needed for formulating, implementing and monitoring policies and programmes "
"aimed at inclusive socioeconomic development and environmental "
"sustainability. Population and housing censuses are an important source for "
"supplying disaggregated data needed for the measurement of progress of the "
"2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, especially in the context of "
"assessing the situation of people by income, sex, age, race, ethnicity, "
"migratory status, disability and geographic location, or other "
"characteristics.</p>\n"
"<p>In recognition of the above, the ECOSOC resolution E/RES/2015/10 "
"establishing the 2020 World Population and Housing Census Programme urges "
"Member States to conduct at least one population and housing census during "
"the period from 2015 to 2024, taking into account international and regional "
"recommendations relating to population and housing censuses and giving "
"particular attention to advance planning, cost efficiency, coverage and the "
"timely dissemination of, and easy access to, census results for national "
"stakeholders, the United Nations and other appropriate intergovernmental "
"organizations in order to inform decisions and facilitate the effective "
"implementation of development plans and programmes.</p>\n"
"<p>The indicator tracks the proportion of countries that have conducted at "
"least one population and housing census in the last 10 years and hence "
"provides information on the availability of disaggregated population and "
"housing data needed for the measurement of progress of the 2030 Agenda for "
"Sustainable Development.</p>"
