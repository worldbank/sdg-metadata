"<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>The indicator is defined as the total count of victims of intentional "
"homicide divided by the total population, expressed per 100,000 population.</"
"p>\n"
"<p>Intentional homicide is defined as the unlawful death inflicted upon a "
"person with the intent to cause death or serious injury (Source: "
"International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes, ICCS 2015); "
"population refers to total resident population in a given country in a given "
"year.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>In the ICCS intentional homicide is defined as the &#x2018;&#x2018;"
"Unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent to cause death or "
"serious injury&#x201D;. This definition contains three elements "
"characterizing the killing of a person as intentional homicide:</p>\n"
"<ol>\n"
"  <li>The killing of a person by another person (objective element);</li>\n"
"  <li>The intent of the perpetrator to kill or seriously injure the victim "
"(subjective element);</li>\n"
"  <li>The unlawfulness of the killing, which means that the law considers "
"the perpetrator liable for the unlawful death (legal element).</li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"<p>This definition states that, for statistical purposes, all killings "
"corresponding to the three criteria above should be considered as "
"intentional homicides, irrespective of definitions provided by national "
"legislations or practices.</p>"

msgctxt "SOURCE_TYPE"
msgid ""
"<h1>Data sources</h1>\n"
"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>Two separate sources exist at country level: a) criminal justice system; "
"b) public health/civil registration. UNODC collects and publishes data from "
"criminal justice systems through its long-lasting annual data collection "
"mandated by the UN General Assembly (UN Crime Trends Survey, UN-CTS); WHO "
"collects and publishes data produced by public health/civil registration. "
"The data collection through the UN-CTS is facilitated by a network of over "
"130 national Focal Points appointed by responsible authorities.</p>\n"
"<p>Currently, when national data on homicide are not available from neither "
"of the two types of source above, estimates produced by WHO are used.</p>\n"
"<p>UNODC and WHO are working together to develop a common approach to "
"produce joint UNODC-WHO homicide data series at country, regional and global "
"level.</p>"

msgctxt "COLL_METHOD"
msgid ""
"<p><strong>Collection process:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>At international level, data on intentional homicides are routinely "
"collected by UNODC through the annual UN-CTS data collection. As requested "
"by the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, over 130 "
"Member States have already appointed a UN-CTS national focal point that "
"delivers UN-CTS data to UNODC. In most cases these focal points are national "
"institutions responsible for data production in the area of crime and "
"criminal justice (National Statistical Offices, Ministry of Interior, "
"Ministry of Justice, etc.). For countries that have not appointed a focal "
"point, the request for data is sent to permanent missions in Vienna. When a "
"country does not report to UNODC, other official sources such as "
"authoritative websites, publications, or other forms of communication are "
"used. Homicide estimates from WHO are currently used when no other source on "
"homicide is available. Once consolidated, data are shared to countries to "
"check their accuracy.</p>\n"
"<p>When data and related metadata are available, some adjustments are made "
"to data in order to assure compliance with the definition of intentional "
"homicide as provided by the ICCS. National data on types of killings that "
"are considered as intentional homicide by the ICCS, while being classified "
"under a different crime at country level, are added to national figures of "
"intentional homicide. This can be done only when detailed data on such types "
"of killings (e.g. serious assault leading to death, honor killing, etc.) are "
"available.</p>\n"
"<p>As for UNODC data dissemination policy, data for SDG monitoring will be "
"sent to countries for consultation prior to publication.</p>"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>This indicator is widely used at national and international level to "
"measure the most extreme form of violent crime and it also provides a direct "
"indication of lack of security. Security from violence is a pre-requisite "
"for individuals to enjoy a safe and active life and for societies and "
"economies to develop freely. Intentional homicides occur in all countries of "
"the world and this indicator has a global applicability.</p>\n"
"<p>Monitoring intentional homicides is necessary to better assess their "
"causes, drivers and consequences and, in the longer term, to develop "
"effective preventive measures. If data are properly disaggregated (as "
"suggested in the ICCS), the indicator can identify the different type of "
"violence associated with homicide: inter-personal (including partner and "
"family-related violence), crime (including organized crime and other forms "
"of criminal activities) and socio-political (including terrorism, hate "
"crime).</p>"

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>The ICCS provides important clarifications on the definition of "
"intentional homicide. In particular, it states that the following killings "
"are included in the count of homicide:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>Murder</li>\n"
"  <li>Honour killing</li>\n"
"  <li>Serious assault leading to death</li>\n"
"  <li>Death as a result of terrorist activities</li>\n"
"  <li>Dowry-related killings</li>\n"
"  <li>Femicide</li>\n"
"  <li>Infanticide</li>\n"
"  <li>Voluntary manslaughter</li>\n"
"  <li>Extrajudicial killings</li>\n"
"  <li>Killings caused by excessive force by law enforcement/state officials</"
"li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>Furthermore, the ICCS provides indications on how to distinguish between "
"intentional homicides, killings directly related to war/conflict and other "
"killings that amount to war crimes.</p>\n"
"<p>The fact that homicide data are typically produced by two separate and "
"independent sources at national level (criminal justice and public health) "
"represents a specific asset of this indicator, as the comparison of the two "
"sources is a tool to assess accuracy of national data. Usually, for "
"countries where data from both sources exist, a good level of matching "
"between the sources is recorded (see UNODC Global Study on Homicide, 2013).</"
"p>\n"
"<p>Data on homicides produced by public health authorities are guided by the "
"International classification of diseases (ICD-10), which provides a "
"definition of &#x2018;Death by assault&#x2019; that is very close to the "
"definition of intentional homicide of the ICCS.</p>"

"<p>The indicator is calculated as the total number of victims of intentional "
"homicide recorded in a given year divided by the total resident population "
"in the same year, multiplied by 100,000.</p>\n"
"<p>In several countries, two separate sets of data on intentional homicide "
"are produced, respectively from criminal justice and public health/civil "
"registration systems. When existing, figures from both data sources are "
"reported. Population data are derived from annual estimates produced by the "
"UN Population Division.</p>"

"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>Considering data collected by both UNODC and WHO, national data on "

"<h2>Disaggregation:</h2>\n"
"<p>Recommended disaggregation for this indicator are:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>sex and age of the victim and the perpetrator (suspected offender)</"
"li>\n"
"  <li>relationship between victim and perpetrator (intimate partner, other "

"<h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>\n"
"<p>Discrepancies might exist between country produced and internationally "

"to comply with the definition provided by the ICCS (approved in 2015 by "
"Member States in the UN Statistical Commission and the UN Commission on "
"Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice). UNODC makes special efforts to count "
"all killings falling under the ICCS definition of intentional homicide, "
"while national data may still be compiled according to national legal "
"systems rather than the statistical classification. . The gradual "
"implementation of ICCS by countries should improve quality and consistency "
"of national and international data.</p>\n"
"<p>Intentional homicide rates may also differ due to the use of different "
