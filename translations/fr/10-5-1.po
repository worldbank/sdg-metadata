"<p><strong><em>Regulatory Tier 1 capital to assets</em></strong>: This is "
"the ratio of the core capital (Tier 1) to total (balance sheet) assets. </"
"p>\n"
"<p> </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets</em></"
"strong><em>:</em> It is calculated using total regulatory Tier 1 capital as "
"the numerator and risk-weighted assets as the denominator. The data for this "
"FSI are compiled in accordance with the guidelines of either Basel I, Basel "
"II, or Basel III. </p>\n"
"<p> </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Nonperforming loans net of provisions to capital</em></"
"strong><em>:</em> This FSI is calculated by taking the value of "
"nonperforming loans (NPLs) less the value of specific loan loss provisions "
"as the numerator and capital as the denominator. Capital is measured as "
"total regulatory capital. </p>\n"
"<p> </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Nonperforming loans to total gross loans</em></strong><em>:</"
"em> This FSI is calculated by using the value of NPLs as the numerator and "
"the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and before the "
"deduction of specific loan- loss provisions) as the denominator. </p>\n"
"<p> </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Return on assets</em></strong><em>:</em> This FSI is "
"calculated by dividing annualized net income before extraordinary items and "
"taxes (as recommended in the FSI Guide) by the average value of total assets "
"(financial and nonfinancial) over the same period. </p>\n"
"<p> </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Liquid assets to short-term liabilities</em></strong>: This "
"FSI is calculated by using the core measure of liquid assets as the "
"numerator and short-term liabilities as the denominator. The ratio can also "
"be calculated by taking the broad measure of liquid assets as the numerator. "
"For jurisdictions that have implemented Basel III, this indicator could be "
"supplemented with the liquidity coverage ratio.</p>\n"
"<p> </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Net open position in foreign exchange to capital</em></"
"strong>: The net open position in foreign exchange should be calculated "
"based on the recommendation of the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision "
"(BCBS). Capital should be total regulatory capital as net open position in "
"foreign exchange is a supervisory concept. </p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Regulatory Tier 1 capital to assets</em></strong><em>:</em> "
"Regulatory Tier 1 capital is calculated based on Basel I, II, or III "
"depending on countries&#x2019; supervisory practices. Denominator is total "
"balance sheet (non-risk weighted) assets. </p>\n"
"<p> </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets</em></"
"strong>: Regulatory Tier 1 capital is calculated based on Basel I, II, or "
"III depending on countries&#x2019; supervisory practices. Denominator is "
"risk-weighted assets also calculated based on Basel standards. </p>\n"
"<p> </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Nonperforming loans (NPLs) net of provisions to capital</em></"
"strong><em>:</em> A loan is classified as NPL when payment of principal or "
"interest is past due by 90 days or more, or evidence exists that a full or "
"partial amount of a loan is not going to be recovered. Only specific loan "
"loss provisions are used in this calculation and they refer charges against "
"the value of specific loans. Data exclude accrued interest in NPLs. Capital "
"is measured as total regulatory capital calculated based on Basel I, II, or "
"III depending on countries&#x2019; supervisory practices.</p>\n"
"<p> </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Nonperforming loans to total gross loans</em></strong><em>:</"
"em> A loan is classified as NPL when payment of principal or interest is "
"past due by 90 days or more, or evidence exists that a full or partial "
"amount of a loan is not going to be recovered. The denominator is the total "
"value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and before the deduction of "
"specific loan- loss provisions). </p>\n"
"<p> </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Return on assets</em></strong>: The numerator is annualized "
"net income before extraordinary items and taxes. The denominator is the "
"average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) over the same "
"period. </p>\n"
"<p> </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Liquid assets to short-term liabilities</em></strong><em>:</"
"em> Core measure of liquid assets includes currency and deposits and other "
"financial assets available on demand or within three months. Broad measures "
"equal core measure plus securities traded in liquid markets that can be "
"converted into cash with minimal change in value. The denominator is short-"
"term elements of debt liabilities plus net (short-term) market value of "
"financial derivatives position. The latter is calculated as financial "
"derivatives liability position minus financial derivative asset position. "
"Short-term refers to three months and should be defined on a remaining "
"maturity basis. If remaining maturity is not available, original maturity "
"can be used as an alternative.</p>\n"
"<p> </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Net open position in foreign exchange to capital</em></"
"strong>: The net open position in foreign exchange equals the foreign-"
"currency and foreign-currency linked element of balance sheet assets and off-"
"balance sheet exposures minus the foreign-currency and foreign-currency "
"linked element of balance sheet liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures. "
"Foreign-currency-linked instruments refer to accounts denominated in "
"national currency, but their payments are linked to exchange rates, thus "
"subject to foreign exchange risk. The denominator is total regulatory "
"capital as defined above. </p>"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Regulatory Tier 1 capital to assets</em></strong>: It is a "
"more stringent version of the leverage ratio and indicates the extent to "
"which assets are funded by other than own funds and is a measure of capital "
"adequacy of the deposit-taking sector. </p>\n"
"<p> </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets</em></"
"strong>: It measures the capital adequacy of deposit takers based on the "
"core capital concept of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). "
"Capital adequacy and availability ultimately determine the degree of "
"robustness of financial institutions to withstand shocks to their balance "
"sheets. </p>\n"
"<p> </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Nonperforming loans net of provisions to capital</em></"
"strong><em>:</em> This FSI is a capital adequacy ratio and is an important "
"indicator of the capacity of bank capital to withstand losses from NPLs that "
"are not covered by specific loan loss provisions. </p>\n"
"<p> </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Nonperforming loans to total gross loans</em></strong>: This "
"FSI is often used as a proxy for asset quality and is intended to identify "
"problems with asset quality in the loan portfolio. </p>\n"
"<p> </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Return on assets</em></strong>: It is an indicator of bank "
"profitability and is intended to measure deposit takers&#x2019; efficiency "
"in using their assets. </p>\n"
"<p> </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Liquid assets to short-term liabilities</em></strong>: It is "
"a liquid asset ratio and is intended to capture the liquidity mismatch of "
"assets and liabilities and provides an indication of the extent to which "
"deposit takers can meet the short-term withdrawal of funds without facing "
"liquidity problems. </p>\n"
"<p> </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Net open position in foreign exchange to capital</em></"
"strong><em>:</em> This FSI is an indicator of sensitivity to market risk, "
"which is intended to gauge deposit takers&#x2019; exposure to exchange rate "
"risk compared with capital. It measures the mismatch of foreign currency "
"asset and liability positions to assess the vulnerability to exchange rate "
"movements.</p>"

"<h1>Data availability</h1>\n"
"<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>As of end-December 2018, there were 138 FSI reporters. All countries "

"a quarter. Data are available as far back as 2005 for some countries.</p>\n"
"<h2>Disaggregation:</h2>\n"
"<p>The FSIs disseminated by the IMF are weighted averages for the sector as "
"a whole (e.g., deposit takers, other financial corporations, nonfinancial "
"corporations). Data for parent banks, their branches, and relevant "

"<h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>\n"

"based on the <em>FSI Compilation Guide</em>, which provides the guidance on "
"the concepts and definitions, and sources and techniques for the compilation "
"of cross-country comparable data to support national and international "
"surveillance of financial systems. To facilitate identification of possible "
"discrepancies across countries, reporters provide metadata to the IMF that "
