"<h2>Concepts: </h2>\n"
"<p>Total energy supply, as defined by the International Recommendations for "
"Energy Statistics (IRES), as made up of production plus net imports minus "
"international marine and aviation bunkers plus-stock changes. Gross Domestic "
"Product (GDP) is the measure of economic output. For international "

"parity </p>"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale: </h2>\n"
"<p>Energy intensity is an indication of how much energy is used to produce "
"one unit of economic output. It is a proxy of the efficiency with which an "
"economy is able to use energy to produce economic output. A lower ratio "
"indicates that less energy is used to produce one unit of output. </p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations: </h2>\n"
"<p>Energy intensity is only an imperfect proxy for energy efficiency. It can "
"be affected by a number of factors, such as climate, structure of the "
"economy, nature of economic activities etc. that are not necessarily linked "
"to pure efficiency. </p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "DATA_COMP"
msgid ""
"<h1>Methodology </h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method: </h2>\n"
"<p>This indicator is based on the development of comprehensive energy "
"statistics across supply and demand for all energy sources &#x2013; "
"statistics used to produce a national energy balance. </p>\n"
"<p>Internationally agreed methodologies for energy statistics are described "
"in the &#x201C;International Recommendations for Energy Statistics&#x201D; "
"(IRES), adopted by the UN Statistical Commission, available at: <a href="
"\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/methodology/ires/\">https://"
"unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/methodology/ires/</a>.</p>\n"
"<p>Once a national energy balance is developed, the indicator can be "
"obtained by dividing total energy supply over GDP. </p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REG_AGG"
msgid ""
"<h2>Regional aggregates: </h2>\n"
"<p>Aggregates are calculated, whether by region or globally, by summing both "
"total energy supply and gross domestic products over relevant countries. </p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "COVERAGE"
msgid ""
"<h1>Data availability </h1>\n"
"<h2>Description: </h2>\n"
"<p>IEA and UN energy balances combined provide total energy supply data for "
"all countries on an annual basis. GDP data are available for most countries "
"on an annual basis. </p>\n"
"<h2>Time series: </h2>\n"
"<p>1990-present </p>\n"
"<h2>Disaggregation: </h2>\n"
"<p>Disaggregation of energy intensity, e.g. by final consumption sectors or "
"end-uses, could provide further insights into progress towards energy "
"efficiency. At present it is only feasible to calculate such sector "
"disaggregations for the following sectors &#x2013; industry, residential, "
"transport, agriculture, households &#x2013; as reported in the <em>Tracking "
"SDG7: The Energy Progress Report</em> (formerly <em>Sustainable Energy for "
"All Global Tracking Framework</em>). It would be desirable, over time, to "
"develop more refined sectoral level energy intensity indicators that make it "
"possible to look at energy intensity by industry (e.g. cement, steel) or by "
"type of vehicle (e.g. cars, trucks), for example. Doing so will not be "
"possible without statistical collaboration with the relevant energy "
"consuming sectors. </p>\n"
"<p>Decomposition analysis of energy intensity trends seeks to filter out "
"factors that affect energy demand, such as economy wide scale and structure "
"shifts, from more narrowly defined energy intensity shifts. The methodology "
"applies decomposition analysis to isolate a more refined measure of energy "
"intensity, one that sifts out the temporal shift of relative sector weights. "
"This analysis is also reported in the <em>Tracking SDG7: The Energy Progress "
"Report</em>. </p>"
