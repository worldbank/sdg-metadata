"<h1>Data sources</h1>\n"
"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>A systematic search on articles published between Jan 1, 1965, and Oct "
"30, 2018. in the databases Embase, PubMed, Global Index Medicus, Popline, "
"and Web of Science. </p>\n"
"<p>Following full text review, we extracted data from each study using the "
"following variables: study characteristics (study and sample collection "
"dates, study locations i.e., city, subnational [an area, region, state, or "
"province in a country], or national level), participant characteristics (age "
"range, sex, year, and population group), and prevalence of the HBV marker, "
"type of laboratory tests, and number of participants the HBV marker "
"prevalence was based on.</p>\n"
"<p>Data of eligible articles were entered into a Microsoft EXCEL&#xAE; and/"
"or Distiller databank by two reviewers independently. Information was "
"extracted for author name, year, age, gender, marker, laboratory test used, "
"number of individuals tested, prevalence of each marker when reported, the "
"population group (general population, HCWs, or blood donors) and whether the "
"data reported was for a city, sub-national (an area, region, state or "
"province in a country) or national level, GDP per capita. In addition to "
"HBsAg, HBeAg was recorded, as available for individuals when HBsAg was also "
"reported. In order to record information on methodological quality and study "
"bias resulting from non-representativeness, an additional variable was used: "
"samples likely to be representative for the country/area specified were "
"coded as 0 and others, e.g. convenience samples in certain communities or "
"tribes in the country were assigned a 1, supplemented by additional "
"information. The risk of bias/non-representativeness information was applied "
"if the population was neither HCW nor blood donor (see description below)."
"<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[3]</a></sup> In the "
"following, variables extracted from the studies and assumptions made are "
"described in detail:</p>\n"
"<p>1. Author, Date</p>\n"
"<p>2. Year start/end of study conduct: Year of study begin and end was "
"extracted. If this information was not available from the studies, we used "
"the commonly used assumption that the study was conducted two years prior to "
"the year of publication (e.g. author, 2000, year of study conduct: 1998). </"
"p>\n"
"<p>3. Sex: Sex-specific values were extracted. If only an overall (all) "
"estimate was provided, the share of females in the study was specified in "
"the column additional information.</p>\n"
"<p>4. Age start/end: The most specific age-group provided by the data was "
"extracted. If the age-group on which the parameter value was based on was "
"not available, assumptions were made based on the context of the study. "
"Therefore, the following was applied in case of missing information on age-"
"groups in the study population: </p>\n"
"<p> a. If the study was conducted in the general population without further "
"specification and if only one prevalence estimate is provided, the age-group "
"was considered to be 0-85 years. Subsequently, if the beginning and last age-"
"group is missing, the lower value of the youngest age-group is 1 year, the "
"upper value of the oldest age-groups is 85 years. </p>\n"
"<p> b. If the study was conducted among adult populations but no age-range "
"is provided, the age-group is considered to be 17-65 years.</p>\n"
"<p> </p>\n"
"<p> c. If the study was conducted among pupils but no age-range is provided, "
"the age-group is considered to be 5-15 years. </p>\n"
"<p> d. If the study was conducted among pregnant women but no age-range is "
"provided, the age-group is considered to be 15-49 years (reproductive age). "
"</p>\n"
"<p> e. If the study was conducted among blood donors but no age-range is "
"provided, the age-group is considered to be 17-65 years. </p>\n"
"<p> f. If the study was conducted among army recruits or soldiers but no age-"
"range is provided, the age-group is considered to be 18-45 years. </p>\n"
"<p> g. If the study was conducted among the working population but no age-"
"range is provided, the age-group is considered to be 16-65 years. </p>\n"
"<p> h. HBsAg Prevalence: The most specific prevalence estimate provided by "
"the data was extracted (defined by age-/sex-/year-prevalence). Separate "
"lines for each marker were used in the data extraction file (e.g. one for "
"HBeAg and one line for HBsAg, even if the study group/publication was the "
"same)</p>\n"
"<p>5. HBeAg Prevalence (optional marker): The most specific prevalence "
"estimate (defined by age-/sex-/year-prevalence) of HBeAg among HBsAg-"
"positive individuals was extracted and, if applicable was calculated to "
"reflect prevalence among HBsAg carriers. </p>\n"
"<p>6. anti-HBc Prevalence (optional marker): The most specific prevalence "
"estimate provided by the data was extracted (defined by age-/sex-/year-"
"prevalence).</p>\n"
"<p>7. Laboratory method: Testing immune response markers of HBV infection "
"began in the 1970s by counter-immuno-electrophoresis technique (CIEP). Since "
"then, different detection methods have been developed (RIA, EIA, &#x2026;). "
"The most applied method in prevalence studies is the ELISA (enzyme-linked "
"immunosorbent assay). Five categories were established to record the method/"
"test used for prevalence detection in the studies: ELI new (ELISA -2, -3, "
"EIA, &#x2026;), EIA old (CMIA, CIEP, RPHA), NAT (qPCR/real-time PCR, nested "
"PCR, multiplex PCR), other (e.g. RIA); Unknown/not specified.</p>\n"
"<p>8. Country: Country names were recorded according to www.who.int and, for "
"additional analysis purpose, were grouped according to the six WHO regions: "
"the African Region, the Region of the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean "
"Region, the European Region, the South East-Asia Region and the Western "
"Pacific Region.</p>\n"
"<p>9. Sample size of individuals blood drawn from; of individuals involved "
"in analyses/bases for parameter estimate: As a quality indicator of the "
"study, we distinguished the effective sample size, i.e. the number of "
"individuals involved in the analysis/on which the parameter estimate is "
"based on, from the number of individuals from which blood was drawn from "
"(separate column) and the initially calculated/planed sample size (separate "
"column). </p>\n"
"<p>10. Population: Although focus was on the general population, two "
"additional groups were included and specified. These include: HCW and blood "
"donor (plus subgroups unspecified, paid, unpaid/voluntary). If in this "
"column &#x201C;population&#x201D; was specified as HCW or blood donor and "
"not as general population, the risk of bias column (following) remains empty."
"</p>\n"
"<p>11. Level: Information is provided if the study was conducted on a "
"national, sub-national, city level or if the level was not further specified "
"(four categories).</p>\n"
"<p>12. Study Location: This free-text variable specifies the city/area "
"within the country where the included study was conducted. The variables/"
"columns Level and Study Location were additionally included following the "
"WHO Meeting on Impact of Hepatitis B Vaccination at WHO, Geneva, in March "

msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The purpose is to describe the reduction in chronic hepatitis b "
"infections. Most of the burden of disease from HBV infection comes from "
"infections acquired before the age of 5 years. Therefore, prevention of HBV "
"infection focuses on children under 5 years of age. The United Nations "
"selected the cumulative incidence of chronic HBV infection at 5 years of age "
"as an indicator of the Sustainable Development Goal target for &#x201C;"
"combating hepatitis&#x201D;. This indicator is measured indirectly through "
"the proportion of children 5 years of age who have developed chronic HBV "
"infection (i.e. the proportion that tests positive for a marker of infection "
"called hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]). </p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>The main Limitations of the analysis is that despite the thorough and in-"
"depth literature search and access, there are fewer data on post vaccination "
"studies than pre- vaccination studies. The model is largely informed by pre-"
"vaccination studies in adults.</p>\n"
"<p>The quality of studies and data was assessed by reviewing "
"representativeness of sampling. Bias factor is a dichotomous variable.</p>\n"
"<p>Potential important biases included geographical representation of the "
"data points. Also, studies were from many different sources such as blood "
"donors and pregnant women. The former possibly having a lower proportion of "
"Hep B prevalence than the general population as donor questionnaires often "
"exclude individuals with risk factors for blood-borne diseases and the "
"pregnant women possibly having a higher prevalence as were in studies to see "
"the effect of a birth dose of vaccine to prevent vertical transmission. As "
"the proportion of studies and size of studies that were from blood donors "
"was significantly greater than those on pregnant women, we may presume that "
"our estimates of prevalence of pre- vaccination may be on the low side.</p>"

msgctxt "DATA_COMP"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>The data was modelled using a Bayesian logistic regression looking at the "
"proportion of individuals that tested positive for HBsAg in each study, "
"weighting each study by its size and using a conditional autoregressive "
"(CAR) model accounting for spatial and economic correlations between similar "
"countries. This model uses data from well sampled countries to estimate "
"prevalence in more data poor countries with effects such as sex, age and "
"vaccination status, these are also informed by the geographic and countries "
"GDP proximity to other countries (CAR model). Under the assumption that "
"countries that are close together economically and/or geographically will "
"have more similar prevalence due to similar social structure and health care "
"capabilities. </p>\n"
"<p>The response variable in the model was the prevalence of Hepatitis "
"surface antigen (HBsAg) with the explanatory variables being age (three "
"categories, under 5, juvenile (5-15) and adult (16+), split using the "
"average age of participants in the study), sex (proportion female in the "
"study), study bias (e.g. a high fraction of study participants from "
"indigenous populations), 3 dose vaccine coverage, birth dose of the vaccine "
"and country of study. The coverage of routine 3 dose vaccination and birth "
"dose vaccination in each study was calculated by cross referencing the year "
"of and age of participants in each study with the corresponding WHO-UNICEF "
"vaccine coverage estimates for that country. The WHO-UNICEF estimates are "
"annual data for the country as a whole, and did not contain information on "
"vaccine efficacy which was not used in the analysis as no data on this was "
"obtained. The vaccine efficacy would be implicitly estimated in the analysis "
"as we see vaccination having a variable effect across time and space across "
"the studies. The coverage of routine 3 dose vaccination and birth dose "
"vaccination in each study was calculated by cross referencing the year of "
"and age of participants in each study with the corresponding WHO-UNICEF "
"vaccine coverage estimates for that country. The coverage of routine 3 dose "
"vaccination and birth dose vaccination in each study was calculated by cross "
"referencing the year of and age of participants in each study with the "
"corresponding WHO-UNICEF vaccine coverage estimates for that country. More "
"explicitly, the model uses the ages and timing of the study to calculate the "
"years across which the participants are born, so if the if there was an age "
"group range of 10-15 in a study that was undertaken in 2015, the birth years "
"would be from 2000-2005, we then average the vaccination coverage from the "
"WHO-UNICEF estimates across those 5 years assuming that each age was evenly "
"represented in that age group in the study. The same process was used for "
"the 3 dose and birth dose vaccination. </p>\n"

"<p>Where <em>n<sub>i</sub></em> is the number of neighbours for country "
"<em>i</em> and weights <em>w<sub>i</sub></em>, are 1. </p>\n"
"<p>The model was simulated in the Bayesian statistical package WinBUGS, and "
"data manipulation and model initialisation run from R (3.3.1) using "
"R2WinBUGS. The model considers the parameters of age, sex, study bias (e.g. "
"a high fraction of study participants from indigenous populations), vaccine "
"coverage, birth dose of the vaccine and country of study. </p>\n"
"<p>The model uses the CAR-normal function, in WinBUGS, to model the spatial "
"and economic autocorrelation related to neighbouring countries. For each "
"country that had prevalence data, a weighted central position was calculated "
"using the size and location of each study. For those countries with no data, "
"we used the population centroid. In a novel approach, we considered 3 "
"dimensions in the country adjacency matrix; we used the usual geographic "
"dimensions, latitude and longitude and also combined these with the natural "
"log of the country&#x2019;s GDP per capita. This was to measure not only "
"geographic but also the developmental proximity of countries. The adjacency "
"matrix for the geo-economic distance gives a score between each country to "
"every other country. Those countries which are close geographically and "
"economically would have a low score and those further apart either "
"geographically or economically would have a high score/distance. Therefore, "
"those countries that are more alike will have a low score and those "
"countries which are alike would have a high score. </p>\n"
"<p>The way we proportioned the geographic and economic distance to produce "
"the adjacency matrix was then explored, this is because geographic distance "
"may be more or less important than economic similarities. Thus, by creating "
"a number of different adjacency matrices (not definitive) we could select "
"the most suitable matrix that explains reality best. We normalised the "
"geographic and GDP distance and then calculated the distance between these "
"two normalised figures. This creates a smoothed Gaussian surface that is "
"dependent on both spatial proximity and GDP per-capita proximity. We "
"compared ratios of, 1:0, 1:1, 2:1, 1:2 (Geographic:GDP). </p>\n"
"<p>For each different adjacency matrix, we also had to select a "
"neighbourhood distance, i.e. over what distance can a country be effected by "
"another. Thus, we also varied the radius of distance from which to select "
"neighbours for the neighbourhood network, we used the maximum minimum "
"distance, twice the maximum minimum and three times the maximum minimum, "
"thus varying the number of neighbours each country would have. </p>\n"
"<p>Finally, to decide the magnitude of the effect one country has on another "
"in the neighbourhood network we varied the weights of pairs of countries in "
"the adjacency matrix, using either a neutral weighting of 1, so that each "
"neighbour has an equal effect on each other (not dependent on the distance "
"in the network), or decaying weights over distance with 1/distance, and 1/"
"distance2, where the closer the country is the greater the effect it has on "
"another country. The outcome of these 36 different combinations led to "
"minimum DIC (Deviance Information Criterion) being found for a ratio of 1:2 "
"(Geographic:GDP), the neighbourhood networks minimum distance being twice "
"the maximum minimum distance and an even weighting of 1/distance for each "
"adjacent country. </p>\n"
"<p>This model structure produces estimates for all fixed effects and also "
"individual country level risk, this provides information on which are "
"significantly at greater or lower risk to the average risk. </p>\n"
"<p>All parameters were given un-informative priors. Simulations were run "
"with 3 MCMC chains with 50,000 burn in iterations and each parameter "
"estimated from 1000 samples taken from a thinned 250,000 iterations to "
"produce the posterior distribution. Convergence was attained, with r&#x302; "
"values all very close to 1.000. Due to the Bayesian framework and WinBUGS "
"software it was possible to gain estimates for countries where we had no "
"data on prevalence, using their GDP and geographic proximity to inform this "
"estimate. Those countries with the largest number of studies provided the "
"estimates with the tightest confidence intervals and those with few or no "
"data were less well defined, often producing a log normal distributed "
"posterior distribution, giving estimates with long tails. </p>\n"
"<p>Posterior distributions of parameters were inspected for convergence and "
"to check for covariance between parameters. Where necessary parameters were "
"centred and scaled to N (0, 1) to aid parameter convergence and remover "
"covariance. This was done for the sex parameter, which was entered as the "
"proportion of the sample that was female; this was seen to co-vary with the "
"intercept and bias parameters before re-centring and scaling. However, the "
"covariance of routine vaccination and birth dose persisted even after re-"
"centring. This is in part unsurprising as there a few instances where birth "
"dose is administered without the routine vaccination. Here we tried to "
"reduce this interaction of the terms by transforming the birth dose data. We "
"modelled birth dose using only data where the birth dose was greater than "
"60, 70, 80 &amp; 90% respectively, we also modelled birth dose to the "
"square, thus increasing the effect of high birth doses over smaller doses. "
"Model selection dependent on which one both reduced the covariance between "
"the parameters and returned the lowest DIC score. </p>\n"
"<p>Model validation was conducted using 90% of randomly selected data "
"against the remaining 10%, and by comparing model estimates of prevalence "
"against observed data (Figure 3). Figure 4 shows the average prevalence in "
"each country from all the studies plotted against the models estimate. "
"Figure 5 shows the marginal and joint posterior distributions for the fitted "
"parameters. Table 1 gives the estimated parameter values with associated "
"credible intervals.</p>\n"
"<p>During the validation exercise (in which countries were consulted over "
"their estimates) it was pointed out that China had undertaken three very "
"large-scale population-based serological surveys in order to establish "
"baseline prevalence and progress towards HBV elimination. There were a large "
"number of other surveys from China, that are less representative than these "
"three nationwide surveys. We conducted a sensitivity analysis by restricting "
"the data from China to the three nationally representative surveys. The "
"effect of this change in input data was that the effect of vaccination was "
"more distinct, but the estimated age effects (change in prevalence in "
"children under 5, or juveniles (children 5-15 years)) were no longer "
"significantly different from zero (see Table 2 and Figure 6). The deviance "
"was significantly reduced, suggesting a much better fitting model (Table 2), "
"albeit on a somewhat reduced dataset.</p>"
