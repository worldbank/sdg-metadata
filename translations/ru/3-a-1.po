"<p>The indicator is defined as the percentage of the population aged 15 "
"years and over who currently use any tobacco product (smoked and/or "
"smokeless tobacco) on a daily or non-daily basis.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>Tobacco use means use of smoked and/or smokeless tobacco products. "
"&#x201C;Current use&#x201D; means use within the previous 30 days at the "
"time of the survey, whether daily or non-daily use.</p>\n"
"<p>Tobacco products means products entirely or partly made of the leaf "
"tobacco as raw material intended for human consumption through smoking, "
"sucking, chewing or sniffing. </p>\n"
"<p>&#x201C;Smoked tobacco products&#x201D; include cigarettes, cigarillos, "
"cigars, cheroots, bidis, pipes, shisha (water pipes), roll-your-own tobacco, "
"kretek and any other form of tobacco that is consumed by smoking.</p>\n"
"<p>&quot;Smokeless tobacco product&quot; includes moist snuff, creamy snuff, "
"dry snuff, plug, dissolvables, gul, loose leaf, red tooth powder, snus, "
"chimo, gutkha, khaini, gudakhu, zarda, quiwam, dohra, tuibur, nasway, naas, "

"<p>Prevalence estimates have been &#x201C;age-standardized&#x201D; to make "

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Tobacco use is a major contributor to illness and death from non-"
"communicable diseases (NCDs). There is no proven safe level of tobacco use "
"or of second-hand smoke exposure. All daily and non-daily users of tobacco "
"are at risk of a variety of poor health outcomes across the life-course, "
"including NCDs. Reducing the prevalence of current tobacco use will make a "
"large contribution to reducing premature mortality from NCDs (Target 3.4). "
"Routine and regular monitoring of this indicator is necessary to enable "
"accurate monitoring and evaluation of the impact of implementation of the "
"WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), or tobacco control "
"policies in the countries that are not yet Parties to the WHO FCTC, over "
"time. Tobacco use prevalence levels are an appropriate indicator of "
"implementation of SDG Target 3.a &#x201C;Strengthen the implementation of "
"the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in all "
"countries, as appropriate&#x201D;.</p>"

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"

"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>Raw data collected through nationally representative population-based "
"surveys in the countries are used to calculate comparable estimates for this "
"indicator. Information from subnational surveys are not used. </p>\n"
"<p>In some countries, all tobacco use and tobacco smoking may be equivalent, "
"but for many countries where other forms of tobacco are also being consumed, "
"smoking rates will be lower than tobacco use rates to some degree. </p>\n"
"<p>The comparability, quality and frequency of household surveys affects the "
"accuracy and quality of the estimates. Non-comparability of data can arise "
"from the use of different survey instruments, sampling and analysis methods, "
"and indicator definitions across Member States. Surveys may cover a variety "
"of age ranges (not always 15+) and be repeated at irregular intervals. "
"Surveys may include a variety of different tobacco products, or sometimes "
"only one product such as cigarettes, based on the country&#x2019;s "
"perception of which products are important to monitor. Unless both smoked "
"and smokeless products are monitored simultaneously, tobacco use prevalence "
"will be underreported. Countries have begun to monitor use of e-cigarettes "
"and other emerging products, which may confound countries&#x2019; "
"definitions of tobacco use. The definition of current use may not always be "
"restricted to the 30 days prior to the survey. In addition, surveys ask "
"people to self-report their tobacco use, which can lead to under-reporting "
"of tobacco use. </p>\n"
"<p>There is no standard protocol used across Member States to ask people "
"about their tobacco use. WHO&#x2019;s Tobacco Questions for Surveys (TQS) "
"have been adopted in many surveys, which helps improve comparability of "
"indicators across countries.</p>"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>A statistical model based on a Bayesian negative binomial meta-regression "
"is used to model prevalence of current tobacco use for each country, "
"separately for men and women. A full description of the method is available "
"as a peer-reviewed article in The Lancet, volume 385, No. 9972, "
"p966&#x2013;976 (2015). Once the age-and-sex-specific prevalence rates from "
"national surveys were compiled into a dataset, the model was fit to "
"calculate trend estimates from the year 2000 to 2030. The model has two main "
"components: (a) adjusting for missing indicators and age groups, and (b) "
"generating an estimate of trends over time as well as the 95% credible "
"interval around the estimate. Depending on the completeness/"
"comprehensiveness of survey data from a particular country, the model at "
"times makes use of data from other countries to fill information gaps. To "
"fill data gaps, information is &#x201C;borrowed&#x201D; from countries in "
"the same UN sub-region. The resulting trend lines are used to derive "
"estimates for single years, so that a number can be reported even if the "
"country did not run a survey in that year. In order to make the results "
"comparable between countries, the prevalence rates are age-standardized to "
"the WHO Standard Population.</p>\n"
"<p>Estimates for countries with irregular surveys or many data gaps will "
"have large uncertainty ranges, and such results should be interpreted with "
"caution.</p>"

"<p>For countries with less than two surveys completed in different years "
"since 1990, no estimate is calculated, since no trend can be determined. For "
"countries with data from two or more national surveys, data gaps, if any, "
