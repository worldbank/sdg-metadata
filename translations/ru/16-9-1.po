"<h1>Data sources</h1>\n"
"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>Censuses, household surveys such as MICS and DHS and national civil "
"registration systems.</p>\n"
"<h2>Civil registration systems: </h2>\n"
"<p>Civil registration systems that are functioning effectively compile vital "
"statistics that are used to compare the estimated total number of births in "
"a country with the absolute number of registered births during a given "
"period. These data normally refer to live births that were registered within "
"a year or the legal time frame for registration applicable in the country.</"
"p>\n"
"<h2>Household or other population-based surveys:</h2>\n"
"<p>In the absence of reliable administrative data, household surveys have "
"become a key source of data to monitor levels and trends in birth "
"registration. The standard indicator used in DHS and MICS to report on birth "
"registration refers to the percentage of children under age 5 (0-59 months) "
"with a birth certificate, regardless of whether or not it was seen by the "
"interviewer, or whose birth was reported as registered with civil "
"authorities at the time of survey. Depending on the country, surveys "
"collecting these data may be conducted every 3-5 years, or possibly at more "
"frequent intervals.</p>\n"
"<p><strong>Censuses </strong>can also provide data on children who have "
"acquired their right to a legal identity. However, censuses are conducted "
"only every ten years (in most countries) and are therefore not well-suited "
"for routine monitoring.</p>"

"<h2>Collection process:</h2>\n"
"<p>UNICEF undertakes a wide consultative process of compiling and assessing "

"<p>Up until 2017, the mechanism UNICEF used to collaborate with national "
"authorities on ensuring data quality and international comparability on key "
"indicators of relevance to children was known as Country Data Reporting on "
"the Indicators for the Goals (CRING).</p>\n"
"<p>As of 2018, UNICEF undertakes an annual consultation with government "
"authorities on 10 of the child-related SDG indicators in its role of sole or "
"joint custodian, and in line with its global monitoring mandate and "
"normative commitments to advancing the 2030 Agenda for children. This "

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Registering children at birth is the first step in securing their "
"recognition before the law, safeguarding their rights, and ensuring that any "
"violation of these rights does not go unnoticed.</p>\n"
"<p>Children without official identification documents may be denied health "
"care or education. Later in life, the lack of such documentation can mean "
"that a child may enter into marriage or the labour market, or be conscripted "
"into the armed forces, before the legal age. In adulthood, birth "
"certificates may be required to obtain social assistance or a job in the "
"formal sector, to buy or prove the right to inherit property, to vote and to "
"obtain a passport. </p>\n"
"<p>Children&#x2019;s right to a name and nationality is enshrined in the "
"Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) under Article 7.</p>"

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>The number of children who have acquired their right to a legal identity "
"is collected mainly through censuses, civil registration systems and "
"household surveys. Civil registration systems that are functioning "
"effectively compile vital statistics that are used to compare the estimated "
"total number of births in a country with the absolute number of registered "
"births during a given period. However, the systematic recording of births in "
"many countries remains a serious challenge. In the absence of reliable "
"administrative data, household surveys have become a key source of data to "
"monitor levels and trends in birth registration. In most low- and middle-"
"income countries, such surveys represent the sole source of this information."
"</p>\n"
"<p>Data from household surveys like MICS or DHS sometimes refer only to "
"children with a birth certificate. UNICEF methodically notes this difference "
"when publishing country-level estimates for global SDG monitoring.</p>"

"number of children under the age of five in the population multiplied by 100."

"country-level estimate</p>\n"

"</ul>\n"
"<p>The regional average is applied to those countries within the region with "
"missing values for the purposes of calculating regional aggregates only, but "
"are not published as country-level estimates. Regional aggregates are only "
"published when at least 50 per cent of the regional population for the "
"relevant age group are covered by the available data.</p>\n"

"<h2>Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the "
"data at the national level:</h2>\n"
"<p>Substantial differences can exist between CRVS coverage and birth "
"registration levels as captured by household surveys. The differences are "
"primarily because data from CRVS typically refer to the percentage of all "
"births that have been registered (often within a specific timeframe) whereas "
"household surveys often represent the percentage of children under age five "
"whose births are registered. The latter (the level of registration among "
"children under 5) is specified in the SDG indicator.</p>"

msgctxt "QUALITY_MGMNT"
msgid ""
"<h2>Quality assurance:</h2>\n"
"<p>UNICEF maintains the global database on birth registration that is used "
"for SDG and other official reporting. Before the inclusion of any data point "
"in the database, it is reviewed by technical focal points at UNICEF "
"headquarters to check for consistency and overall data quality. This review "
"is based on a set of objective criteria to ensure that only the most recent "
"and reliable information are included in the databases. These criteria "
"include the following: data sources must include proper documentation; data "
"values must be representative at the national population level; data are "
"collected using an appropriate methodology (e.g., sampling); data values are "
"based on a sufficiently large sample; data conform to the standard indicator "
"definition including age group and concepts, to the extent possible; data "
"are plausible based on trends and consistency with previously published/"
"reported estimates for the indicator. </p>\n"
"<p>As of 2018, UNICEF launched a new country consultation process with "
"national authorities on selected SDG indicators, which place strong emphasis "
"on technical rigour, country ownership and use of official data and "
"statistics. The consultation process solicited feedback directly from "
"National Statistical Offices, as well as other government agencies "
"responsible for official statistics, on the compilation of the indicators, "
"including the data sources used, and the application of internationally "
"agreed definitions, classification and methodologies to the data from that "
"source. Once reviewed, feedback is made available to countries on whether or "
"not specific data points are accepted, and if not, the reasons why. More "
"details on the consultation process can be found in the child-related global "
"SDG indicators it is custodian or co-custodian to meet emerging standards "
"and guidelines on data flows for global reporting of <a href=\"https://data."
