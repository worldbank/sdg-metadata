msgid ""
"<p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>The average annual number of people requiring treatment and care for NTDs "
"is the number that is expected to decrease toward &#x201C;the end of "
"NTDs&#x201D; by 2030 (target 3.3), as NTDs are eradicated, eliminated or "
"controlled. The number of people requiring other interventions against NTDs "
"(e.g. vector management, veterinary public health, water, sanitation and "
"hygiene) are expected to need to be maintained beyond 2030 and are therefore "
"to be addressed in the context of other targets and indicators, namely "
"Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and universal access to water and sanitation."
"</p>\n"
"<p>This number should not be interpreted as the number of people at risk for "
"NTDs. It is in fact a subset of the larger number of people at risk. Mass "
"treatment is limited to those living in districts above a threshold level of "
"prevalence; it does not include all people living in districts with any risk "
"of infection. Individual treatment and care is for those who are or have "
"already been infected; it does not include all contacts and others at risk "
"of infection. This number can better be interpreted as the number of people "
"at a level of risk requiring medical intervention &#x2013; that is, "
"treatment and care for NTDs.</p>"

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>Country reports may not be perfectly comparable over time. Improved "
"surveillance and case-finding may lead to an apparent increase in the number "
"of people known to require treatment and care. Some further estimation may "
"be required to adjust for changes in surveillance and case-finding. Missing "
"country reports may need to be imputed for some diseases in some years.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "DATA_COMP"
msgid ""
"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>Some estimation is required to aggregate data across interventions and "
"diseases. There is an established methodology that has been tested and an "
"agreed international standard. [<a href=\"http://www.who.int/wer/2012/"
"wer8702.pdf?ua=1\">http://www.who.int/wer/2012/wer8702.pdf?ua=1</a>]</p>\n"
"<p>1) Average annual number of people requiring mass treatment known as PC "
"for at least one PC-NTD (lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, "
"schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiases and trachoma). People may "
"require PC for more than one PC-NTD. The number of people requiring PC is "
"compared across the PC-NTDs, by age group and implementation unit (e.g. "
"district). The largest number of people requiring PC is retained for each "
"age group in each implementation unit. The total is considered to be a "
"conservative estimate of the number of people requiring PC for at least one "
"PC-NTD. Prevalence surveys determine when an NTD has been eliminated or "
"controlled and PC can be stopped or reduced in frequency, such that the "
"average annual number of people requiring PC is reduced.</p>\n"
"<p>2) Number of new cases requiring individual treatment and care for other "
"NTDs: The number of new cases is based on country reports, whenever "
"available, of new and known cases of Buruli ulcer, dengue, dracunculiasis, "
"echinococcosis, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), leprosy, the "
"leishmaniases, rabies and yaws. Where the number of people requiring and "
"requesting surgery for PC-NTDs (e.g. trichiasis or hydrocele surgery) is "
"reported, it can be added here. Similarly, new cases requiring and "
"requesting rehabilitation (e.g. leprosy or lymphoedema) can be added "
"whenever available.</p>\n"
"<p>Populations referred to under 1) and 2) may overlap; the sum would "
"overestimate the total number of people requiring treatment and care. The "
"maximum of 1) or 2) is therefore retained at the lowest common "
"implementation unit and summed to get conservative country, regional and "
"global aggregates. By 2030, improved co-endemicity data and models will "
"validate the trends obtained using this simplified approach.</p>"
