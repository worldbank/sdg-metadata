"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>The proportion of seats held by women in (a) national parliaments, "
"currently as at 1 January of reporting year, is currently measured as the "
"number of seats held by women members in single or lower chambers of "
"national parliaments, expressed as a percentage of all occupied seats.</p>\n"
"<p>National parliaments can be bicameral or unicameral. This indicator "
"covers the single chamber in unicameral parliaments and the lower chamber in "
"bicameral parliaments. It does not cover the upper chamber of bicameral "
"parliaments. Seats are usually won by members in general parliamentary "
"elections. Seats may also be filled by nomination, appointment, indirect "
"election, rotation of members and by-election.</p>\n"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator measures the degree to which women have equal access to "
"parliamentary decision making. Women&#x2019;s participation in parliaments "
"is a key aspect of women&#x2019;s opportunities in political and public "
"life, and is therefore linked to women&#x2019;s empowerment. Equal numbers "
"of women and men in lower chambers would give an indicator value of 50 per "
"cent.</p>\n"
"<p>A stronger presence of women in parliament allows new concerns to be "
"highlighted on political agendas, and new priorities to be put into practice "
"through the adoption and implementation of policies and laws. The inclusion "
"of the perspectives and interests of women is a prerequisite for democracy "
"and gender equality, and contributes to good governance. A representative "
"parliament also allows the different experiences of men and women to affect "
"the social, political and economic future of societies.</p>\n"
"<p>Changes in the indicator have been tracked over time. Although the "
"international community has supported and promoted women&#x2019;s "
"participation in political decision-making structures for several decades, "
"improvement in women&#x2019;s access to parliament has been slow. This has "
"led to the introduction of special policy and legal measures to increase "
"women&#x2019;s shares of parliamentary seats in several countries. Those "
"countries that have adopted special measures generally have greater "
"representation of women in parliament than countries without special "
"measures.</p>"

"<ul>\n"
"  <li>The number of countries covered varies with suspensions or "
"dissolutions of parliaments. As of 1 February 2016, 193 countries are "
"included.</li>\n"
"  <li>There can be difficulties in obtaining information on by-election "
"results and replacements due to death or resignation. These changes are ad "
"hoc events which are more difficult to keep track of. By-elections, for "
"instance, are often not announced internationally as general elections are.</"
"li>\n"
"  <li>The data excludes the numbers and percentages of women in upper "
"chambers of parliament. The information in available on the IPU website at "

"  <li>Parliaments vary considerably in their internal workings and "
"procedures, however, generally legislate, oversee government and represent "
"the electorate. In terms of measuring women&#x2019;s contribution to "
"political decision making, this indicator may not be sufficient because some "
"women may face obstacles in fully and efficiently carrying out their "
"parliamentary mandate.</li>\n"

"<h1>Data availability</h1>\n"
"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>Data are available for 193 countries. Information is available in all "

"parliaments that have been dissolved or suspended for an indefinite period.</"
