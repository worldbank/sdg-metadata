"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator is defined as the number of countries that have adopted "
"legislative, administrative and policy frameworks to ensure fair and "
"equitable sharing of benefits. It refers to the efforts by countries to "
"implement the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair "
"and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the "
"Convention on Biological Diversity<em> </em>(2010) and the International "
"Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (2001).</p>\n"
"<p>The Nagoya Protocol covers genetic resources and traditional knowledge "
"associated with genetic resources, as well as the benefits arising from "
"their utilization by setting out core obligations for its contracting "
"Parties to take measures in relation to access, benefit-sharing and "
"compliance. The objectives of the International Treaty are the conservation "
"and sustainable use of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture and "
"the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of their use, in "
"harmony with the Convention on Biological Diversity. </p>\n"
"<p>The Protocol provides greater legal certainty and transparency for both "
"providers and users of genetic resources and associated traditional "
"knowledge, and therefore, encourages the advancement of research on genetic "
"resources which could lead to new discoveries for the benefit of all. </p>\n"
"<p>The Nagoya Protocol also creates incentives to conserve and sustainably "
"use genetic resources, and thereby enhances the contribution of biodiversity "
"to development and human well-being. In addition, Parties to the Protocol "
"are to encourage users and providers to direct benefits arising from the "
"utilization of genetic resources towards the conservation of biological "
"diversity and the sustainable use of its components.</p>\n"
"<p>The International Treaty has established the Multilateral System of "
"Access and Benefit-sharing, which facilitates exchanges of plant genetic "
"resources for purposes of agricultural research and breeding, by providing a "
"transparent and reliable framework for the exchange of crop genetic "
"resources. The Multilateral System is instrumental to achieving the "
"conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources as well as the "
"fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their use. </p>"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale and interpretation:</h2>\n"
"<p>The Nagoya Protocol, to be operational, requires that certain enabling "
"conditions are met at the national level for its effective implementation. "
"In particular, countries will need, depending on their specific "
"circumstances, to revise legislative, administrative or policy measures "
"already in place or develop new measures in order to meet the obligations "
"set out under the Protocol. </p>\n"
"<p>In particular, the Nagoya Protocol provides that Parties are to take "
"legislative, administrative or policy measures, as appropriate, to ensure "
"the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization "
"of genetic resources, including for genetic resources that are held by "
"indigenous communities, and benefits arising from the utilization of "
"traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources. </p>\n"
"<p>The ABS Clearing-House is a platform for exchanging information on access "
"and benefit-sharing established by Article 14 of the Protocol, The ABS "
"Clearing-House is a key tool for facilitating the implementation of the "
"Nagoya Protocol, by enhancing legal certainty and transparency on procedures "
"for access, and for monitoring the utilization of genetic resources along "
"the value chain. The Protocol requires Parties to make information on "
"legislative, administrative and policy measures available to the ABS "
"Clearing-House. Non-Parties are also encouraged to make this information "
"available in the same manner. The goal is to allow users of genetic "
"resources and associated traditional knowledge to easily find information on "
"the ABS Clearing-House on how to access these resources and knowledge in an "
"organized manner, and all in one convenient location.</p>\n"
"<p>The International Treaty stipulates that Contracting Parties ensure the "
"conformity of its laws, regulations and procedures with their obligations "
"under the International Treaty (Article 4). Under the Multilateral System of "
"Access and Benefit-sharing (Articles 10-13), countries grant each other "
"facilitated access to their plant genetic resources, while users of plant "
"genetic material from the Multilateral System are encouraged to share their "
"benefits with the Multilateral System. Such benefits should primarily flow "
"to farmers in developing countries who promote the conservation and "
"sustainable use of plant genetic resources. </p>\n"
"<p>Pursuant to Article 21, the Governing Body adopted the Procedures and "
"operational mechanism to promote compliance and address issues of non-"
"compliance. Under the monitoring and reporting in the Procedures, each "
"Contracting Party is requested to submit a report on the measures it has "
"taken to implement its obligations under the International Treaty, including "
"the access and benefit-sharing measures. Contracting Parties report using an "
"agreed standard format and through the Online Reporting System on "
"Compliance. Additionally, information on the number of Standard Material "
"Transfer Agreements is gathered from the Data Store of the International "
"Treaty through Easy-SMTA. SMTA is a mandatory contract that Contracting "
"Parties of the International Treaty have agreed to use whenever plant "
"genetic resources falling under the Multilateral System are made available. "
"</p>\n"
"<p>Indicator 15.6.1 directly measures progress made by countries in "
"establishing legislative, administrative or policy frameworks on access and "
"benefit-sharing (ABS). By developing their ABS frameworks, countries are "
"contributing to the achievement of SDG Target 15.6 and to the conservation "
"and sustainable use of biological and genetic diversity. Progress in this "
"indicator is assessed through measuring the increase in the number of "
"countries that have adopted ABS legislative, administrative and policy "
"measures and that have made available this information in the ABS Clearing-"
"House and through the Online Reporting System on Compliance of the "
"International Treaty in relation to plant genetic resources for food and "
"agriculture. </p>"

"<p>The notion of framework suggests that there is a complete set of rules "

"a predefined idea of what constitutes an ABS framework. In the context of "
"this indicator, the publication by a country of one or more ABS legislative, "
"administrative and policy measure in the ABS Clearing-House would be "
"considered progress by that country on having an ABS legislative, "
"administrative and policy framework, and through the Online Reporting System "
