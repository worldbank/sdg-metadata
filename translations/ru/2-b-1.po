"<h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>\n"
"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>Agricultural export subsidies are defined as export subsidies budgetary "
"outlays and quantities as notified by WTO Members in Tables ES:1 and "
"supporting Tables ES:2 (following templates in document G/AG/2 dated 30 June "
"1995).</p>\n"
"<p>Data cover:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>Notifications by WTO Members with export subsidy reduction commitments "
"included in part IV of their Schedules;</li>\n"
"  <li>Notifications of export subsidies by developing country Members "
"pursuant to the provisions of article 9.4 of the Agreement on Agriculture.</"
"li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>Other WTO Members are not entitled to use export subsidies and their "
"notifications are therefore not recorded in the indicator series.</p>\n"
"<p>Budgetary outlays and quantities are expressed in a currency (national or "
"other) and in quantity units as per Member&apos;s notification practices. "
"For Members with export subsidy reduction commitments included in part IV of "
"their Schedules, the currency used in the notifications is similar to the "
"one used in the Schedules.</p>\n"
"<p>Data are available by country and by products or groups of products, "
"according to Members&apos; schedules for Members with export subsidy "
"reduction commitments included in part IV of their Schedules and according "
"to Member&apos;s notification practices in the case of developing country "
"Members using export subsidies under the provisions of article 9.4 of the "
"Agreement on Agriculture.&quot;</p>"
