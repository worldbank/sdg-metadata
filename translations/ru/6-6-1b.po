"<h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>\n"
"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Extent of wetlands:</em></strong> This term can be defined as "
"the surface area of wetlands. It is measured in km2 or hectares. It is "
"expected that the surface reported by countries in 2018 corresponds to the "
"2017; if not, the reference year should be indicated. </p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Change in the extent of wetlands</em></strong>: This term "
"refers to the percentage change in area of wetlands from a baseline "
"reference. For reporting such change, the previous extent, if known, and the "
"period over which the change has taken place should be specified. </p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>In order to provide a precise definition of the indicator, it is crucial "
"to provide a definition of <strong>&#x201C;Water related ecosystems.&#x201D; "
"</strong>For this purpose, the definition of the Ramsar Convention on "
"Wetlands is used.</p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>The Ramsar definition of &#x201C;wetlands&#x201D;</em></"
"strong></p>\n"
"<p>The Ramsar definition is very broad, reflecting the purpose and global "
"coverage of the Convention:</p>\n"
"<p>In accordance with Article 1.1 of the Convention, <br><em>&#x201C;"
"Wetlands are areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or "
"artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, "
"fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which "
"at low tide does not exceed six metres&#x201D;.</em></p>\n"
"<p>In addition, in accordance with Article 2.1, Ramsar Sites <br><em>&#x201C;"
"may incorporate riparian and coastal zones adjacent to the wetlands, and "
"islands or bodies of marine water deeper than six metres at low tide lying "
"within the wetlands&#x201D;.</em></p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>The Ramsar system of classifying wetland types</em></strong></"
"p>\n"
"<p>Many national definitions and classifications of &#x201C;wetlands&#x201D; "
"are in use. They have been developed in response to different national needs "
"and take into account the main biophysical features (generally vegetation, "
"landform and water regime, and sometimes also water chemistry such as "
"salinity) and the variety and size of wetlands in the locality or region "
"being considered.</p>\n"
"<p>The <u>Ramsar Classification System for Wetland Types</u>, adopted at "
"COP4 in 1990, and amended at COP6 in 1996 (Resolution VI.5) and at COP7 in "
"1999 (Resolution VII.11) has value as a basic internationally applicable "
"habitat description for sites designated for the Ramsar List of Wetlands of "
"International Importance.</p>\n"
"<p>The System (see <strong>Annex 1)</strong> describes the types of wetland "
"covered by each of the wetland type codes. Note that the wetland types are "
"grouped in three major categories: <u>marine/coastal</u>, <u>inland</u>, and "
"<u>human-made</u> wetlands. Within a single Ramsar Site or other wetland, "
"there may be wetland types from two or more of these categories, "
"particularly if the wetland is large. </p>\n"
"<p>For the purpose of the Target and Indicator, and based on the National "
"Reports Parties report on the use of the three major categories. Countries "
"also use Ramsar definition that has been internationally agreed under the "
"Convention. The minimum information that should be provided is the total "
"area of wetlands for each of these three categories with an emphasis on "
"inland wetlands or freshwater ecosystems for purpose of indicator 6.6.1 (see "
"table below, the explanations of each wetland type code is in Annex 1). </"

"<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands Secretariat has been collecting and "
"analysing data on country implementation since 2000 including information "
"about wetland inventories. This is done at intervals of 3 years that is the "
"cycle of Country reporting under the Convention </p>\n"
"<p>The 1999 review of the state of wetland inventory worldwide (<em>Global "
"review of wetland resources and priorities for wetland inventory </em>- "
"GRoWI), which was undertaken for the Ramsar Convention, identified not only "
"the major gaps in the extent to which wetland inventory had been undertaken, "
"but also found that for the inventories which had been made it was "
"frequently very hard to trace their existence, to identify their purpose, "
"scope and coverage, and/or to access the information contained in them.</p>\n"
"<p>Another source of information is the update of the Wetland Extent Trends "
"(WET) Index that was commissioned by the Ramsar Convention Secretariat to "
"WCMC. The Wet Index is an updatable indicator of wetland area trends where "
"there are still gaps of information. However, is not applicable at national "
"level and has been used, as data are not available at national level. This "
"will be fixed with national reports. </p>\n"
"<p>In the format for National Report for COP13 the Contracting Parties "
"agreed the inclusion of an indicator on the extent of wetlands and change in "
"the extent (indicator 6.6.1). For COP13, 44% of Contracting Parties have "
"completed national wetlands inventories and 16% of Parties reported that "
"their wetland inventories are in progress. Therefore, all data are provided "
"to the Ramsar Secretariat by countries in the form of a country report "

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands is the Intergovernmental treaty that "
"provides the framework for the Conservation and wise use of wetlands and "
"their resources. The Convention was adopted in 1971 and came into force in "
"1975. Since then 170 Countries, representing almost 90% on UN member states, "
"from all the world&#xB4;s geographic regions have acceded to become "
"Contracting Parties under the Convention.</p>\n"
"<p>At its 52nd meeting, in 2016, the Standing Committee of the Ramsar "
"Convention agreed that Parties would include in their national reports for "
"the 13th meeting of the Conference of the Parties, which have been submitted "
"in January 2018, data on the &#x201C;extent&#x201D; of wetlands. This "
"requirement provides an intergovernmental mechanism to obtain verified data "
"that clearly contribute to Indicator 6.6.1 on wetland extent, but also to "
"collect information for Target 15.1 which consider other types of "
"ecosystems. </p>\n"
"<p>The indicator provides a measure of the relative extent of inland "
"wetlands in a country. It follows the rationale of the forest indicator "
"(Indicator 15.1.1). The availability of accurate data on a country&apos;s "
"wetland extent based on the country&#xB4;s wetland inventory is crucial for "
"the decision making regarding policies, restoration of critical wetlands or "
"designation under national or international management or protected area "
"categories. </p>\n"
"<p>Changes in the wetland extent reflect wetland loss and degradation for "
"land use changes or for other uses and may help identify unsustainable "
"practices from different sectors.</p>"

"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>The 1999 review of the state of wetland inventory worldwide (<em>Global "
"review of wetland resources and priorities for wetland inventory </em>- "
"GRoWI), which was undertaken for the Ramsar Convention, identified not only "
"the major gaps in the extent to which wetland inventory had been undertaken, "
"but also found that for the inventories which had been made it was "
"frequently very hard to trace their existence, to identify their purpose, "
"scope and coverage, and/or to access the information contained in them. </"
"p>\n"
"<p>In the light of these findings and to help address this lack of access by "
"those who need to use wetland inventory for a wide range of Convention "
"implementation purposes, the Convention&#x2019;s Scientific &amp; Technical "
"Review Panel (STRP) developed a standard model for wetland inventory "
"metadata (i.e., data about the characteristics of a wetland inventory, "
"rather than the inventory data itself) in order to facilitate those who have "
"inventories in making the existence and availability of these more publicly "
"accessible.</p>\n"
"<p>In 2002, several limitations were identified (Ramsar COP8) in the use of "
"EO for routinely deriving wetland information. These included the cost of "
"the technology, the technical capacity needed to use the data, the "
"unsuitability of the data available for some basic applications (in "
"particular in terms of spatial resolution), the lack of clear, robust and "
"efficient user-oriented methods and guidelines for using the technology, and "
"a lack of solid track record of successful case studies that could form a "
"basis for operational activities. </p>\n"
"<p>Historical optical data is available from Landsat and Spot missions; "
"however, persistent cloud cover in certain regions renders much of these "
"data unusable. Distinguishing between permanent and temporary surface water "
"and wetlands can therefore be difficult considering the available historical "
"data. It is further noted that for complex environments with different "
"wetland types <em>in situ</em> data or local knowledge is critical to "
"support the analysis of the EO data, and is sometimes the only way to obtain "
"information on certain wetland types.</p>\n"
"<p>Another limitation is that some countries are in the process of update or "
"complete their national wetlands inventories in others are still gaps or is "
"difficult to access the available information.</p>\n"
"<p>Despite the above limitations, the use of the measure of extent of "
"wetlands will respond to the indicator and will allow to having a practical "
"mechanism in the short term to track the status of water related ecosystems "
"with robust data and foster action for the conservation of these important "
"ecosystems. </p>"

"<p>The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands has taken many steps to ensure the wise "
"use and conservation of wetlands globally. This has included the development "
"and promotion of guidance and best practice tools for the inventory, "
"assessment and monitoring of change in wetlands with a particular emphasis "
"in recent years on the application of an increasing number of satellite-"
"based remote sensing approaches (Davidson &amp; Finlayson 2007; Mackay et "
"al. 2009; Ramsar Secretariat 2010a). This has become necessary as there is "
"an increasing demand for information that can be readily used by wetland "
"managers to help stem the ongoing loss and degradation of wetlands. </p>\n"
"<p>The utility of different remote sensing datasets for wetland inventory, "
"monitoring and assessment is well established, in particular through the "
"provision of site based (Land Use Land Cover (LULC)) maps characterising a "
"particular ecosystem, to the analysis of time series data (remote sensing "
"datasets collected consistently over a particular time period) to determine "
"changes.</p>\n"
"<p>The availability and accessibility of EO datasets suitable for addressing "
"the information needs of the Ramsar Convention and wetland practitioners has "
"increased dramatically in the recent past; increasing capabilities in terms "
"of spatial, temporal and spectral resolution of the data have enabled more "
"efficient and reliable monitoring of the environment over time at global, "
"regional and local scales.</p>\n"
"<p>The Scientific and Technical Review Panel of the Convention has produceda "
"Ramsar Technical Report on &#x201C;Best practice guidelines for the use of "
"Earth Observation for wetland inventory, assessment and monitoring: An "
"information source for wetland managers provided by the Ramsar Convention "
"for Wetlands&#x201D;. The Ramsar Convention and EO based approaches build on "
"those previously undertaken on the use of EO technologies for implementation "
"of the Convention (Ramsar 2002; Davidson &amp; Finlayson 2007; Mackay et al. "
"2009) and are placed within the conceptualisation of wetland inventory, "
"assessment and monitoring that were incorporated into the IF-WIAM (Ramsar "
"Secretariat 2010b). </p>\n"
"<p>The purpose of the report is to provide an overview of the application of "
"EO technologies to inform wetland managers and practitioners, and "
"stakeholders, including those from related sectors, such as protected area "
"managers and wetland education centre staff (Ramsar Convention 2015) about "
"&#x201C;best practice&#x201D; use of EO technologies, taking into account "
"requirements and recommendations from the Convention. </p>\n"
"<p>EO provides an effective means for periodic mapping and monitoring over "
"regional to global scales. It should, however, not be expected that global "
"datasets, can achieve the same high level of accuracy everywhere as a local "
"scale map derived through ground surveys and the use of finer resolution "
"(aerial, drones) geospatial data.</p>\n"
"<p>Although mapping of land cover and land uses are one of the most common "
"uses of EO data, there are still challenges in assessing the current status "
"and changes in wetlands over time. Monitoring historical trends and changing "
"patterns of wetlands is complicated by the lack of medium to high-resolution "
"data in particular prior to 2000. </p>\n"
"<p>Despite the ever expanding data archives, improving quality and "
"increasing suitability of EO data for wetland inventory, monitoring and "
"assessment, it is important to note that &#x201C;ground-truthing&#x201D; or "
"field based assessments and validation are still a vital component of any "
"work involving EO data, whose occasional omission may still lead to "
"problematic results. </p>\n"
"<p>Ramsar partners such as Jaxa and ESA have conducted pilot projects that "
"provide geospatial information to provide changes to Ramsar, national "
"wetland practitioners, decision makers, and NGOs. </p>\n"
"<p>Wetland inventory provides the basis for guiding the development of "
"appropriate assessment and monitoring, and is used to collect information to "
"describe the ecological character of wetlands including that used to support "
"the listing of Ramsar sites, as recorded in the Ramsar Information Sheet "
"(Ramsar Secretariat 2012), assessment considers the pressures and associated "
"risks of adverse change in ecological character; and monitoring, which can "
"include both survey and surveillance, provides information on the extent of "
"any change that occurs as a consequence of management actions. </p>\n"
"<p>Under the Convention multiple guidelines have been developed to support "
"countries to complete national wetland inventories including the use of "
"metadata (Some of these guidelines are mentioned below). More recently in "
"2020 the Secretariat prepared a toolkit on wetlands inventory to assist "
"Contracting Parties to implement or update a NWI. The aim of the toolkit is "
"to provide practical guidance and examples of how to implement an NWI, "
"including a step-by-step process and resources to support each "
"recommendation. Good practices and examples on the areas of carrying out and "
"updating NWIs, inventory methods, data collection, Earth observation and use "
"of wetland inventories in decision-making are provided. Examples that "
"illustrate how to solve the challenges faced by Contracting Parties are also "
"included. The toolkit includes an introduction linking NWIs to SDG targets "
"and expounding on the importance of an NWI for decision-making, including "
"suggestions for building the case for supporting and protecting wetlands. </"
"p>\n"
"<p>The Secretariat is using the toolkit as a central resource for the "
"development of training materials, webinars and other training opportunities "
"for Contracting Parties.</p>\n"
