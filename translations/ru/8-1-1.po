"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>Annual growth rate of real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is "
"calculated as the percentage change in the real GDP per capita between two "
"consecutive years. Real GDP per capita is calculated by dividing GDP at "
"constant prices by the population of a country or area. The data for real "
"GDP are measured in constant US dollars to facilitate the calculation of "
"country growth rates and aggregation of the country data</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures the monetary value of final goods "
"and services&#x2014;that is, those that are bought by the final user&#x2014;"
"produced in an economic territory country in a given period of time (say a "
"quarter or a year). It is calculated without making deductions for "
"depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of "
"natural resources. GDP can be measured using the expenditure approach as the "
"sum of expenditure on final consumption plus gross capital formation plus "
"exports less imports, the production approach as the value of output less "
"intermediate consumption plus any taxes less subsidies on products not "
"already included in the value of output, or the income approach as "
"compensation of employees plus gross operating surplus plus gross mixed "
"incomes plus taxes less subsidies on both production and imports</p>"

"<p>The underlying annual GDP estimates in domestic currency are collected "

msgid ""
"<h2>Collection process:</h2>\n"
"<p>Each year, the national accounts section of the UNSD sends a pre-filled "
"NAQ to countries or areas to collect the latest data on official annual "
"national accounts in domestic currency. In order to lighten the reporting "
"burden of countries to different international and regional organizations "
"the UNSD receives data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and "
"Development (OECD), the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) "
"and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) on behalf of their constituents.</p>\n"
"<p>The official national accounts data in domestic currency are then "
"validated to check for errors. The validation procedure involves ensuring "
"that aggregates are equal to the sum of their components and that data "
"series which are provided in multiple tables are represented consistently. "
"After that, the current and constant price GDP series are converted into US "
"dollars by applying the corresponding market exchange rates as reported by "
"the International Monetary Fund (IMF). When these conversion rates are not "
"available other IMF rates are used (official rates or principal rates).</p>\n"
"<p>For countries whose exchange rates are not reported by the IMF, the "
"annual average of United Nations operational rates of exchange (UNOPs) is "
"applied. The UNOPs are conversion rates that are applied in official "
"transactions of the United Nations with these countries. These exchange "
"rates are based on official, commercial and/or tourist rates of exchange.</"
"p>\n"
"<p>In cases where a country experiences considerable distortion in the "
"conversion rates, the UNSD uses price-adjusted rates of exchange (PARE) as "
"an alternative to the exchange rates reported by the IMF or UN operational "
"rates of exchange. The conversion based on PARE corrects the distorting "
"effects of uneven price changes that are not well reflected in the other "
"conversion rates. Consequently, unrealistic levels in GDP and other national "
"accounts aggregates expressed in US Dollars may have been adjusted for "
"certain time periods to improve the economic analysis at national, regional "
"and local levels.</p>\n"
"<p>The estimates derived for each year are compared to previous years to "
"ensure that estimates are prepared consistently from year to year. "
"Additionally, the growth rate from year to year is analysed to identify "
"anomalies in the data.</p>\n"
"<p>The constant-price GDP series for each country is then divided by its "
"population to obtain its real GDP per capita.</p>\n"

"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>Although countries or areas calculate GDP using the common principles and "
"recommendations in the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA), "
"there are still problems in international comparability of GDP estimates. "
"These include:</p>\n"
"<p>a. Different versions of the SNA (for example, 1968, 1993 or 2008) "
"countries or areas use in calculating their GDP estimates</p>\n"
"<p>b. Different degree of coverage of informal and non-observed economic "
"activities in the GDP estimates</p>\n"
"<p>Further, as a necessary condition to being a key economic performance "
"indicator of sustainable development, one of the often-cited limitations of "
"GDP is that it does not account for the social and environmental costs of "
"production. It is designed as a measure of the level of overall well-being. "
"For example, growth in real GDP per capita reveals nothing concerning energy "
"and material interactions with the environment.</p>"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>The annual growth rate of real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is "
"calculated as follows:</p>\n"
"<p>a. Convert annual real GDP in domestic currency at 2015 prices for a "
"country or area to US dollars at 2015 prices using the 2015 exchange rates.</"
"p>\n"
"<p>b. Divide the result by the population of the country or area to obtain "
"annual real GDP per capita in constant US dollars at 2015 prices.</p>\n"
"<p>c. Calculate the annual growth rate of real GDP per capita in year t+1 "
"using the following formula: [(G(t+1) &#x2013; G(t))/G(t)] x 100, where G(t"
"+1) is real GDP per capita in 2015 US dollars in year t+1 and G(t) is real "
"GDP per capita in 2015 US dollars in year t.</p>"

"<p>When a full set of official annual GDP data is not available, estimation "

msgctxt "COMPARABILITY"
msgid ""
"<h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>\n"
"<p>The differences with country data include the following:</p>\n"
"<p>a. Official country data are typically available in domestic currency "
"only. The data estimates for this indicator are in US dollars.</p>\n"
"<p>b. Countries or areas may not have a full set of official GDP data. The "
"GDP data estimated by UNSD include imputations using various estimation "
"procedures as described above to obtain estimates for the entire time series."
"</p>\n"
"<p>c. Official country data are often reported as multiple sets of time "
"series versions, with each version representing a unique methodology used to "
"compile the national accounts data (for example, a difference between two "
"time series versions could reflect a change in currency, a switch from 1968 "
"SNA to 1993 SNA, a change in the office responsible for compiling national "
"accounts, etc.). These time series versions may not be comparable, "
"especially when a country has shifted from the 1968 SNA to 1993 SNA or 2008 "
"SNA. When a single time series version does not exist for the entire period "
"(1970 to t-1), UNSD uses estimation procedures to backcast the most recently "
"reported time series version. Backcasting is only performed when time series "
"overlap for at least one year. The overlapping year is used to create a "
"ratio; this ratio is then applied backwards to the previous time series "
"version. If there is a change of fiscal year between two official data time "
"series, the older series are converted to the fiscal year type of the most "
"recent time series prior to backcasting. UNSD uses the same backcasting "
"methods when official country constant price time series versions include "
"multiple base years or when constant price time series versions are reported "
"as constant prices of the previous year (CPPY). CPPY data are backcasted by "
"using the officially reported current price data and the officially reported "
"constant price data. The data are backcasted into a single series with a "
"fixed base year.</p>\n"
"<p>d. The population estimates from the United Nations Population Division "
"may be different from country-produce estimates as the former include "
"analysis carried out to take into account deficiencies such as "
"incompleteness of coverage, lack of timeliness and errors in the reporting "
"or coding of the basic information and to establish past population trends "
"by resolving the inconsistencies affecting the basic data.</p>"
