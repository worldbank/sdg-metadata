"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>Malaria incidence (1) is expressed as the number of new cases per 100,000 "
"population per year with the population of a country derived from "
"projections made by the UN Population Division and the total proportion at "
"risk estimated by a country&#x2019;s National Malaria Control Programme. "
"More specifically, the country estimates what is the proportion at high risk "
"(H) and what is the proportion at low risk (L) and the total population at "
"risk is estimated as UN Population x (H + L).</p>\n"
"<p>The total number of new cases, T, is estimated from the number of malaria "
"cases reported by a Ministry of Health which is adjusted to take into "
"account (i) incompleteness in reporting systems (ii) patients seeking "
"treatment in the private sector, self-medicating or not seeking treatment at "
"all, and (iii) potential over-diagnosis through the lack of laboratory "
"confirmation of cases. The procedure, which is described in the <em>World "
"malaria report 2009</em> (2), combines data reported by NMCPs (reported "
"cases, reporting completeness and likelihood that cases are parasite "
"positive) with data obtained from nationally representative household "
"surveys on health-service use. Briefly, </p>\n"
"<p>T = (a + (c x e)/d) x (1 + h/g + ((1-g-h)/2/g)</p>\n"
"<p>where:<br>a is malaria cases confirmed in public sector<br>b is suspected "
"cases tested<br>c is presumed cases (not tested but treated as "
"malaria)<br>d<em> </em>is reporting completeness<br>e<em> </em>is test "
"positivity rate (malaria positive fraction) = a/b<br>f<em> </em>is cases in "
"public sector, calculated by (a + (c x e))/d<em><br></em>g<em> </em>is "
"treatment seeking fraction in public sector<br>h is treatment seeking "
"fraction in private sector<br>i is the fraction not seeking treatment, "
"calculated by (1-g-h)/2 <br>j is cases in private sector, calculated by f x "
"h/g<br>k is cases not in private and not in public, calculated by f x i/"
"g<br>T is total cases, calculated by f + j + k. </p>\n"
"<p>To estimate the uncertainty around the number of cases, the test "
"positivity rate was assumed to have a normal distribution centred on the "
"<em>Test positivity rate</em> value and standard deviation defined as</p>\n"
"<p>0.244 x Test positivity rate<sup>0.5547</sup></p>\n"
"<p>and truncated to be in the range 0, 1. Reporting completeness was assumed "
"to have one of three distributions, depending on the range or value reported "
"by the NMCP. If the range was greater than 80% the distribution was assumed "
"to be triangular, with limits of 0.8 and 1 and the peak at 0.8. If the range "
"was greater than 50% then the distribution was assumed to be rectangular, "
"with limits of 0.5 and 0.8. Finally, if the range was lower than 50% the "
"distribution was assumed to be triangular, with limits of 0 and 0.5 and the "
"peak at 0.5 (3) . If the reporting completeness was reported as a value and "
"was greater than 80%, a beta distribution was assumed with a mean value of "
"the reported value (maximum of 95%) and confidence intervals (CIs) of 5% "
"round the mean value. The proportions of children for whom care was sought "
"in the private sector and in the public sector were assumed to have a beta "
"distribution, with the mean value being the estimated value in the survey "
"and the standard deviation calculated from the range of the estimated 95% "
"confidence intervals (CI) divided by 4. The proportion of children for whom "
"care was not sought was assumed to have a rectangular distribution, with the "
"lower limit 0 and upper limit calculated as 1 minus the proportion that "
"sought care in public or private sector. </p>\n"
"<p>Values for the proportion seeking care were linearly interpolated between "
"the years that have a survey, and were extrapolated for the years before the "
"first or after the last survey. Missing values for the distributions were "
"imputed using a mixture of the distribution of the country, with equal "
"probability for the years where values were present or, if there was no "
"value at all for any year in the country, a mixture of the distribution of "
"the region for that year. The data were analysed using the R statistical "
"software (4). Confidence intervals were obtained from 10000 draws of the "
"convoluted distributions. (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bolivia (Plurinational "
"State of), Botswana, Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Dominican Republic, "
"Eritrea, Ethiopia, French Guiana, Gambia, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, "
"Honduras, India, Indonesia, Lao People&#x2019;s Democratic Republic, "
"Madagascar, Mauritania, Mayotte, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, "
"Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Rwanda, Senegal, "
"Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Vanuatu, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), "
"Viet Nam, Yemen and Zimbabwe. For India, the values were obtained at "
"subnational level using the same methodology, but adjusting the private "
"sector for an additional factor due to the active case detection, estimated "
"as the ratio of the test positivity rate in the active case detection over "
"the test positivity rate for the passive case detection. This factor was "
"assumed to have a normal distribution, with mean value and standard "
"deviation calculated from the values reported in 2010. Bangladesh, Bolivia, "
"Botswana, Brazil, Cabo Verde, Colombia, Dominican Republic, French Guiana, "
"Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Myanmar (since 2013), Rwanda, Suriname "
"and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) report cases from the private and "
"public sector together; therefore, no adjustment for private sector seeking "
"treatment was made. </p>\n"
"<p>For some high-transmission African countries the quality of case "
"reporting is considered insufficient for the above formulae to be applied. "
"In such cases estimates of the number of malaria cases are derived from "
"information on parasite prevalence obtained from household surveys. First, "
"data on parasite prevalence from nearly 60&#xA0;000 survey records were "
"assembled within a spatiotemporal Bayesian geostatistical model, along with "
"environmental and sociodemographic covariates, and data distribution on "
"interventions such as ITNs, antimalarial drugs and IRS. The geospatial model "
"enabled predictions of Plasmodium falciparum prevalence in children aged "
"2&#x2013;10 years, at a resolution of 5 &#xD7; 5 km2, throughout all malaria "
"endemic African countries for each year from 2000 to 2016 (see <a href="
"\"http://www.map.ox.ac.uk/making-maps/\">http://www.map.ox.ac.uk/making-maps/"
"</a> for methods on the development of maps by the Malaria Atlas Project). "
"Second, an ensemble model was developed to predict malaria incidence as a "
"function of parasite prevalence. The model was then applied to the estimated "
"parasite prevalence in order to obtain estimates of the malaria case "
"incidence at 5 &#xD7; 5 km<sup>2</sup> resolution for each year from 2000 to "
"2016. Data for each 5 &#xD7; 5 km<sup>2</sup> area were then aggregated "
"within country and regional boundaries to obtain both national and regional "
"estimates of malaria cases (5). (Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, "
"Chad, Congo, C&#xF4;te d&apos;Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, "
"Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Guinea, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, "
"Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Togo and Zambia)</p>\n"
"<p>For most of the elimination countries, the number of indigenous cases "
"registered by the NMCPs are reported without further adjustments. (Algeria, "
"Argentina, Belize, Bhutan, Cabo Verde, China, Comoros, Costa Rica, "
"Democratic People&#x2019;s Republic of Korea, Djibuti, Ecuador, El Salvador, "
"Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Malaysia, Mexico, Paraguay, Republic of "
