"<p>The indicator proportion of individuals using the Internet is defined as "
"the proportion of individuals who used the Internet from any location in the "
"last three months.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>The Internet is a worldwide public computer network. It provides access "
"to a number of communication services including the World Wide Web and "
"carries e-mail, news, entertainment and data files, irrespective of the "
"device used (not assumed to be only via a computer - it may also be by "
"mobile telephone, tablet, PDA, games machine, digital TV etc.). Access can "
"be via a fixed or mobile network.</p>"

msgctxt "SOURCE_TYPE"

"<h1>Data sources</h1>\n"
"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator proportion of individuals using the Internet is based on an "
"internationally agreed definition and methodology, which have been developed "
"under the coordination of ITU, through its Expert Groups and following an "
"extensive consultation process with countries. It is also a core indicator "
"of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development&apos;s Core List of "
"Indicators, which has been endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission (last "
"time in 2014). Data on individuals using the Internet are collected through "
"an annual questionnaire that ITU sends to national statistical offices "
"(NSO). In this questionnaire ITU collects absolute values. The percentages "
"are calculated a-posteriori. The survey methodology is verified to ensure "
"that it meets adequate statistical standards. The data are verified to "
"ensure consistency with previous years&#x2019; data and situation of the "
"country for other related indicators (ICT and economic).</p>\n"
"<p>For most developed and an increasing number of developing countries, "
"percentage of individuals using the Internet data are based on "
"methodologically sound household surveys conducted by national statistical "
"agencies. If the NSO has not collected Internet user statistics, then ITU "
"estimates the percentage of individuals using the Internet.</p>\n"
"<p>Data are usually not adjusted, but discrepancies in the definition, age "
"scope of individuals, reference period or the break in comparability between "
"years are noted in a data note. For this reason, data are not always "
"strictly comparable.</p>\n"
"<p>Some countries conduct a household survey where the question on Internet "
"use is included every year. For others, the frequency is every two or three "
"years. Overall, the indicator is available for 100 countries at least from "
"one survey in the years 2011-2014.</p>\n"
"<p>ITU makes the indicator available for each year for 200 economies by "
"using survey data and estimates for almost all countries of the world.</p>"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The Internet has become an increasingly important tool to access public "
"information, which is a relevant means to protect fundamental freedoms. The "
"number of Internet users has increased substantially over the last decade "
"and access to the Internet has changed the way people live, communicate, "
"work and do business. Internet uptake is a key indicator tracked by policy "
"makers and others to measure the development of the information society and "
"the growth of Internet content &#x2013; including user-generated content "
"&#x2013; provides access to increasing amounts of information and services.</"
"p>\n"
"<p>Despite growth in networks, services and applications, information and "
"communication technology (ICT) access and use is still far from equally "
"distributed, and many people cannot yet benefit from the potential of the "
"Internet. This indicator highlights the importance of Internet use as a "
"development enabler and helps to measure the digital divide, which, if not "
"properly addressed, will aggravate inequalities in all development domains. "
"Classificatory variables for individuals using the Internet &#x2013;such as "
"age, sex, education level or labour force status &#x2013; can help identify "
"digital divides in individuals using the Internet. This information can "
"contribute to the design of targeted policies to overcome those divides.</"
"p>\n"
"<p>The proportion of individuals using the Internet is an established "
"indicator and also one of the three ICT-related Millennium Development Goal "
"(MDG) indicators (for Target 8F). It is part of the Partnership on Measuring "
"ICT for Development&apos;s Core List of Indicators, which has been endorsed "
"by the UN Statistical Commission (last time in 2014). It is also included in "
"the ITU ICT Development Index, and thus considered a key metric for "
"international comparisons of ICT developments.</p>"

"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>While the data on the percentage of individuals using the Internet are "
"very reliable for countries that have collected the data through official "
"household surveys, they are less reliable in cases where the number of "
"Internet users is estimated by ITU. ITU is encouraging all countries to "
"collect data on this indicator through official surveys and the number of "
"countries with official data for this indicator is increasing.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "DATA_COMP"
msgid ""
"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>For countries that collect data on this indicator through an official "
"survey, this indicator is calculated by dividing the total number of in-"
"scope individuals using the Internet (from any location) in the last 3 "
"months by the total number of in-scope individuals. For countries that have "
"not carried out a survey, data are estimated (by ITU) based on the number of "
"Internet subscriptions and other socioeconomic indicators (GNI per capita) "
"and on the time series data.</p>"

"</ul>\n"
"<p>In the absence of official household surveys, ITU estimates the "
"percentage of individuals using the Internet (Internet users as a percentage "
"of total population) using various techniques, such as hot-deck imputation, "
"regression models and time series forecast, using data such as income, "
"education and other ICT indicators.</p>\n"

"<h2>Regional aggregates:</h2>\n"
"<p>Country-level data on the percentage of individuals using the Internet "
"(Internet users as a percentage of total population) are first estimated "
"using various techniques, such as hot-deck imputation, regression models and "
"time series forecast. Hot-deck imputation uses data from countries with "
"&#x201C;similar&#x201D; characteristics, such as GNI per capita and "
"geographic location. In cases when it is not possible to find an adequate "
"imputation based on similar cases, regression models based on a set of "
"countries with relatively similar characteristics are applied.</p>\n"
"<p>Once the country-level percentages are available for all countries, the "
"number of Internet users are calculated by multiplying the percentages to "
"the population of the country. The regional and world total Internet users "
"were calculated by summing the country-level data. The aggregate percentages "
"were calculated by dividing the regional totals by the population of "
"respective groups.</p>"

"<h2>Disaggregation:</h2>\n"
"<p>For countries that collect this data on the proportion of individuals "
"using the Internet through an official survey, and if data allow breakdown "
"and disaggregation, the indicator can be broken down by region (geographic "
"and/or urban/rural), by sex, by age group, by educational level, by labour "
"force status, and by occupation. ITU collects data for all of these "
"breakdowns from countries.</p>"

"use a different definition than the one agreed internationally and used by "

"surveys differs, or when the country only provides data for a certain age "
"group and not the total population.</p>"
