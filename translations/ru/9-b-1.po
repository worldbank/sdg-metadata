"<h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>\n"
"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>The proportion of medium-high and high-tech industry (MHT hereafter) "
"value added in total value added of manufacturing (MVA hereafter) is a ratio "
"value between the value added of MHT industry and MVA.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>The value added of an industry (industry value added) is a survey concept "
"that refers to the given industry&#x2019;s net output derived from the "
"difference of gross output and intermediate consumption. Manufacturing "
"sector<em> </em>is defined according to the International Standard "
"Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC) revision 3 "
"(1990) or revision 4 (2008). It refers to industries belonging to sector D "
"in revision 3 or sector C in revision 4.</p>\n"
"<p>Technology classification is based on research and development (R&amp;D) "
"expenditure relative to value added otherwise referred as R&amp;D intensity. "
"Data for R&amp;D intensity are presented in a report (Galindo-Rueda and "
"Verger, 2016) published by the OECD in 2016, which also proposes a taxonomy "
"for industry groups with different ranges of R&amp;D expenditure relative to "
"their gross value added. MHT industries have traditionally been defined "
"exclusively to manufacturing industries. However, there have been recent "
"efforts (Galindo-Rueda and Verger, 2016) to extend the definition to non-"
"manufacturing industries as well. Nevertheless, medium-high and high "
"technology sectors also in new paper are primarily represented by "
"manufacturing industries.</p>\n"
