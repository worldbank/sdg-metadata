"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>Annual growth rate of real GDP per employed person conveys the annual "
"percentage change in real Gross Domestic Product per employed person.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Gross Domestic Product (GDP):</em></strong> It is the main "
"measure of national output, representing the total value of all final goods "
"and services within the System of National Accounts (SNA) production "
"boundary produced in a particular economy (that is, the dollar value of all "
"goods and services within the SNA production boundary produced within a "
"country&#x2019;s borders in a given year). According to the SNA, &#x201C;GDP "
"is the sum of gross value added of all resident producer units plus that "
"part (possibly the total) of taxes on products, less subsidies on products, "
"that is not included in the valuation of output &#x2026; GDP is also equal "
"to the sum of the final uses of goods and services (all uses except "
"intermediate consumption) measured at purchasers&#x2019; prices, less the "
"value of imports of goods and services GDP is also equal to the sum of "
"primary incomes distributed by resident producer units.&#x201D;</p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP):</em></strong> Real GDP "
"refers to GDP calculated at constant prices, that is, the volume level of "
"GDP, excluding the effect of inflation and favouring comparisons of "
"quantities beyond price changes. Constant price estimates of GDP are "
"calculated by expressing values in terms of a base period. In theory, the "
"price and quantity components of a value are identified and the price in the "
"base period is substituted for that in the current period.</p>\n"
"<p><strong><em>Employment</em></strong>: All persons of working age who, "
"during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to "
"produce goods or provide services for pay or profit.</p>"

"<h1>Data sources</h1>\n"
"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>Output measures used in the numerator of this indicator (Gross Domestic "
"Product) are best obtained from the production side of national accounts and "
"represent, as much as possible, GDP at market prices for the aggregate "
"economy (adjusted for inflation, in constant prices).</p>\n"
"<p>Employment data used in the denominator are preferably derived from "
"labour force or other household surveys with an employment module. In the "
"absence of a household survey, establishment surveys, administrative records "
"or official estimates based on reliable sources can be used as well as "
"population censuses. It is however important to note that employment data "
"from establishment surveys will capture the number of jobs and not the "
"number of persons employed as preferred for the denominator. Also, "
"establishment surveys cover, in many cases, the formal sector and employers "
"and employees only, not accounting for the whole economy.</p>\n"
"<p>When calculating this indicator, it is important to ensure that the "
"coverage of the employment data is consistent with that of the national "
"accounts.</p>"

"Bank&#x2019;s World Development Indicators database and country-level "

"ILO&#x2019;s TEM to calculate levels and growth rates of labour productivity "

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Real GDP per employed person being a measure of labour productivity, this "
"indicator represents a measure of labour productivity growth, thus providing "
"information on the evolution, efficiency and quality of human capital in the "
"production process.</p>\n"
"<p>Economic growth in a country can be ascribed to many factors, including "
"increased employment and more effective work by those who are employed. This "
"indicator casts light on the latter effect, therefore being a key measure of "
"economic performance. Labour productivity (and growth) estimates can support "
"the formulation of labour market policies and monitor their effects. They "
"can also contribute to the understanding of how labour market performance "
"affects living standards.</p>"

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>Output measures are obtained from national accounts and represent, as "
"much as possible, GDP at market prices for the aggregate economy. However, "
"despite common principles that are mostly based on the United Nations System "
"of National Accounts, there are still significant problems in international "
"consistency of national accounts estimates, based on factors such as "
"differences in the treatment of output in services sectors, differences in "
"methods used to correct output measures for price changes (in particular, "
"the use of different weighting systems to obtain deflators) and differences "
"in the degree of coverage of informal economic activities.</p>\n"
"<p>Data on employment used in the denominator of this indicator refer, as "
"much as possible, to the average number of persons with one or more paid "
"jobs during the year. That is, the reliability of the employment data is "
"also dependent on the degree of coverage of informal activities by the "
"statistical source used.</p>"

"The employment data derived from the ILO modelled estimates are used to "
"produce estimates on labour productivity. These models use multivariate "

"are then aggregated to produce regional and global estimates. For further "
