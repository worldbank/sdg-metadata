"<p>The Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI) for Government Expenditures is "
"defined as the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure, divided by the "
"Agriculture value added share of GDP, where Agriculture refers to the "
"agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting sector. The measure is a currency-"
"free index, calculated as the ratio of these two shares. National "
"governments are requested to compile Government Expenditures according to "

"<h2><strong><strong>Description:</strong></strong></h2>\n"
"<p>Data on government expenditures is collected from countries using an "
"annual questionnaire administered by FAO. Since countries typically compile "
"government expenditure data based on their financial systems, and is "
"administrative data covering the entirely of government expenditures, "
"particularly at the central government level, there is no sampling issue and "
"no possibility of sampling error. For some countries that do not report such "
"data to FAO, data may be obtained from the IMF GFS database (which includes "
"similar data but covering more sectors, and with less disaggregation of "
"COFOG 042) or from official national governmental websites. </p>\n"
"<p>Data on agriculture value-added and GDP are based on the system of "
"national accounts, which is an analytical framework that compiles national "
"data from a mix of survey, census and administrative (e.g. tax) sources. "
"This data is obtained from the UN Statistics Division, which provides "
"national accounts estimates for 220 countries and territories.</p>"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2><strong><strong>Rationale:</strong></strong></h2>\n"
"<p>An Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI) greater than 1 reflects a higher "
"orientation towards the agriculture sector, which receives a higher share of "
"government spending relative to its contribution to economic value-added. An "
"AOI less than 1 reflects a lower orientation to agriculture, while an AOI "
"equal to 1 reflects neutrality in a government&#x2019;s orientation to the "
"agriculture sector.</p>\n"
"<p>Government spending in agriculture includes spending on sector policies "
"and programs; soil improvement and soil degradation control; irrigation and "
"reservoirs for agricultural use; animal health management, livestock "
"research and training in animal husbandry; marine/freshwater biological "
"research; afforestation and other forestry projects; etc.</p>\n"
"<p>Spending in these agricultural activities helps to increase sector "
"efficiency, productivity and income growth by increasing physical or human "
"capital and /or reducing inter-temporal budget constraints. </p>\n"
"<p>However, the private sector typically under-invests in these activities "
"due to the presence of market failure (e.g. the public good nature of "
"research and development; the positive externalities from improved soil and "
"water conditions; lack of access to competitive credit due to asymmetric "
"information between producers and financial institutions, etc.). Similarly, "
"the high risk faced by agricultural producers, particular smallholders "
"unable to hedge against risk, often requires government intervention in "
"terms of income redistribution to support smallholders in distress following "
"crop failures and livestock loss from pests, droughts, floods, "
"infrastructure failure, or severe price changes. </p>\n"
"<p>Government spending in agriculture is essential to address these market "
"failures and the periodic need for income redistribution. This leads to "
"several potential indicators for the SDGs, which include: a) the level of "
"Government Expenditure on Agriculture (GEA); b) the Agriculture share of "
"Government Expenditure, and c) the AOI for Government Expenditures.</p>\n"
"<p>An indicator that measures GEA levels fails to take into account the size "
"of an economy. If two countries, A and B, have the same level of GEA, and "
"the same agriculture contribution to GDP, but country A&#x2019;s economy is "
"10 times that of country B, setting the same target levels for GEA fails to "
"take economic size into account. </p>\n"
"<p>An indicator that measures the Agriculture share of Government "
"Expenditure fails to take into account the relative contributions of the "
"agricultural sector to a country&#x2019;s GDP. Consider two countries with "
"the same economic size, C and D, where agriculture contributes 2 per cent to "
"C&#x2019;s GDP, and 10 per cent to country D&#x2019;s GDP. If total "
"Government Expenditures were equal in both countries, C would experience "
"greater relative investment in Agriculture than D. If total Government "
"Expenditures differed, the result could be magnified or diluted.</p>\n"
"<p>The AOI index takes into account a country&#x2019;s economic size, "
"Agriculture&#x2019;s contribution to GDP, and the total amount of Government "
"Expenditure. As such, it allows for the setting of a universal and "
"achievable target. Nonetheless, it is useful to interpret the AOI in "
"combination with its numerator and denominator separately: the Agriculture "
"share of Government Expenditure and the Agriculture value-added Share of "
"GDP</p>"

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2><strong><strong>Comments and limitations:</strong></strong></h2>\n"
"<p>Since the numerator of this data is based on administrative sources, "
"there is no confidence interval or standard error associated with government "
"expenditure data. For the denominator, national accounts data typically do "
"not provide any standard error or confidence interval information.</p>\n"
"<p>The key limitation with this indicator is that it takes into account only "
"central government expenditure. To the extent that some countries may have "
"heavier intervention in agriculture by sub-national governments, this will "
"not be taken into account.</p>"
