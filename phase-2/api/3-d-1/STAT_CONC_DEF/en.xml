	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Concepts and definitions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definition:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Percentage of attributes of 13 core capacities that have been attained at a specific point in time. The 13 core capacities are: (1) Legislation and financing; (2) IHR Coordination and National Focal Point Functions; (3) Zoonotic events and the Human-Animal Health Interface; (4) Food safety; (5) Laboratory; (6) Surveillance; (7) Human resources; (8) National Health Emergency Framework; (9) Health Service Provision; (10) Risk communication; (11) Points of entry; (12) Chemical events; (13) Radiation emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; the essential public health capacity that States Parties are required to have in place throughout their territories pursuant to Articles 5 and 12, and Annex 1A of the IHR (2005) requirements by the year 2012. Thirteen core capacities and 24 indicators are defined in this document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indicator&lt;/strong&gt;: a variable that can be measured repeatedly (directly or indirectly) over time to reveal change in a system. It can be qualitative or quantitative, allowing the objective measurement of the progress of a programme or event. The quantitative measurements need to be interpreted in the broader context, taking other sources of information (e.g. supervisory reports and special studies) into consideration and they should be supplemented with qualitative information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attributes:&lt;/strong&gt; one of a set of specific elements or characteristics that reflect the level of performance or achievement of a specific indicator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capability levels:&lt;/strong&gt; Each attribute has been assigned a level of maturity, or a &amp;#x2018;capability level.&amp;#x2019; Attainment of a given capability level requires that all attributes at lower levels are in place. In the checklist, the status of core capacity development is measured at five capability levels, each of the 5 levels used is described by specific indicators, according related capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
