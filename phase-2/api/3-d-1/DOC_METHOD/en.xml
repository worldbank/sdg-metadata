&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Parties of IHR can use the on-line reporting tool, that reflects the questionnaire of the IHR State Parties Self-Assessment Tool was published in July 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool consists of 24 indicators for the thirteen IHR capacities needed to detect, assess, notify, report and respond, including at points of entry, to public health risk and acute events of domestic and international concern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each of the 13 capacities, one to three indicators are used to measure the status of each capacity. Each indicator is based on five cumulative levels for annual reporting. For each indicator, the reporting State Party is asked to select which of the five levels best describes the State Party&amp;#x2019;s current status. For each indicator, in order to move to the next level, all capacities described in previous levels should be in place. &lt;/p&gt;
