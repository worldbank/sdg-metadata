	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data are currently being reported by 185 countries, with good coverage of all regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disaggregation by disease is required; ending the epidemic of NTDs requires a reduction in the number of people requiring interventions for each NTD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disaggregation by age is required for PC: preschool-aged children (1-4 years), school-aged (5-14 years) and adults (= 15 years).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
