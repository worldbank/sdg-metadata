	<message>The STAT_CONC_DEF field for indicator 3-3-5, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Concepts and definitions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definition:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number of people requiring treatment and care for any one of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) targeted by the WHO NTD Roadmap and World Health Assembly resolutions and reported to WHO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment and care is broadly defined to allow for preventive, curative, surgical or rehabilitative treatment and care. In particular, it includes both:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Average annual number of people requiring mass treatment known as preventive chemotherapy (PC) for at least one PC-NTD; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Number of new cases requiring individual treatment and care for other NTDs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other key interventions against NTDs (e.g. vector management, veterinary public health, water, sanitation and hygiene) are to be addressed in the context of other targets and indicators, namely Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and universal access to water and sanitation.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
