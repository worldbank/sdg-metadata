	<data>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collection process&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National TB Programmes report every year between March and June their annual TB data to WHO using a standardized online data reporting system maintained at WHO. The system includes real-time checks for data consistency. Estimates of TB burden are prepared in July-August and communicated with countries. In selected countries with new survey data, estimates are updated separately during the year. All estimates are communicated in August-September and revisions are done based on feedback. The final set of estimates is reviewed in WHO before publication in October, for compliance with specific international standards and harmonization of breakdowns for age and sex groups.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
