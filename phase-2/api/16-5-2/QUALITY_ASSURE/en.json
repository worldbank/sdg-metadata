{"status":"success","message":"The QUALITY_ASSURE field for indicator 16-5-2, translated into en","data":"<h2>Quality assurance:</h2>\n<p>When conducting our survey projects, the implementing fieldwork team must send periodic batches of completed interviews to the World Bank so that we can run our own quality control programs on the data. After running these programs, we provide the QC feedback to the implementing fieldwork team so that survey data, which has been flagged, can be verified and continuously improved. This is how we continuously monitor the survey data while the projects are in the field.</p>\n<p>The World Bank collects this survey data for the public good of information. For an individual survey project, once the data is collected and considered finalized (after our own internal QC processes), the survey data is published on the World Bank&#x2019;s Enterprise Surveys website.</p>"}
