	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 16-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Methodology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computation method:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is calculated for each country, by looking at the proportion of firms which answered &amp;#x2018;yes&amp;#x2019; to the survey question. For all Enterprise Survey projects conducted since 2006, the resulting dataset has sampling weights. Hence the indicator value, which is computed using Stata, incorporates these sampling weights as well as the design strata.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
