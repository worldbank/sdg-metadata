	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Comments and limitations:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The reduction of average tariffs on key sector as agriculture can represent a proxy of the level of commitment of developed country to improve market access conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of limitations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tariffs are only part of the trade limitation factors to the implementation of duty-free and quota-free market access, especially when looking at exports of developing or least developed countries under non-reciprocal preferential treatment that set criteria for eligibility. Accurate estimates on non-tariff measures do not exist, thus the calculations on market access are limited to tariffs only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full coverage of preferential schemes of developed countries has been used for the computation, but preferential treatment may not be fully used by developing countries&amp;apos; exporters for different reasons such as the inability of certain exporters to meet eligibility criteria (i.e., complying with rules of origin).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</data>
