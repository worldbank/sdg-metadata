&lt;h2&gt;Computation method:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some tariff rates which are not expressed in ad valorem form (e.g., specific duties) need to be converted in ad valorem equivalents (i.e. in per cent of the import value). The conversion is made at the tariff line level for each importer by using the unit value method. Import unit values are calculated from import values and quantities. Only a limited number of non-ad valorem tariff rates (i.e. technical duties) cannot be provided with ad valorem equivalents (AVE) and are excluded from the calculation. This methodology also allows for cross-country comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
