	<message>The REG_AGG field for indicator 17-1-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Regional and global estimates &amp;amp; data collection for global monitoring:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IMF Statistics Department will leverage the existing GFS database to provide cross-country comparable series in a standardized presentation format. We would appreciate further discussion with the IAEG SDGs on the merits of deriving regional or global aggregates from the country reported values for this indicator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description of the mechanism for collecting data from countries, including: (i) the official counterpart at the country level; (ii) description of any validation and consultation process;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(iii) description of any adjustments with respect to use of standard classifications and harmonization of breakdowns for age group and other dimensions, or adjustments made for compliance with specific international or national definitions.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
