Budgetary central government, described in <em>GFSM 2014</em> (paragraph 2.81) is an institutional unit of the general government sector particularly important in terms of size and power, particularly the power to exercise control over many other units and entities. The budgetary central government is often a single unit of the central government that encompasses the fundamental activities of the national executive, legislative, and judiciary powers. This component of general government is usually covered by the main (or general) budget. The budgetary central government&#x2019;s revenue (and expense) are normally regulated and controlled by a ministry of finance, or its functional equivalent, by means of a budget approved by the legislature. Most of the ministries, departments, agencies, boards, commissions, judicial authorities, legislative bodies, and other entities that make up the budgetary central government are not separate institutional units. This is because they generally do not have the authority to own assets, incur liabilities, or engage in transactions in their own right (see <em>GFSM 2014</em> paragraph 2.42). including references to standards and classifications, preferably relying on international agreed definitions. The indicator definition should be unambiguous and expressed in universally applicable terms. It must clearly express the unit of measurement (proportion, dollars, number of people, etc.).</p>\n<h2>Concepts: </h2>\n<p>The key concepts and terms associated with the indicator are outlined in <em>GFSM 2014</em>, as are the associated classifications.
