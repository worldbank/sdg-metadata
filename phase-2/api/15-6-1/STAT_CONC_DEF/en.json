{"status":"success","message":"The STAT_CONC_DEF field for indicator 15-6-1, translated into en","data":"<h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>\n<h2>Definition:</h2>\n<p>The indicator is defined as the number of countries that have adopted legislative, administrative and policy frameworks to ensure fair and equitable sharing of benefits. It refers to the efforts by countries to implement the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity<em> </em>(2010) and the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (2001).</p>\n<p>The Nagoya Protocol covers genetic resources and traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources, as well as the benefits arising from their utilization by setting out core obligations for its contracting Parties to take measures in relation to access, benefit-sharing and compliance. The objectives of the International Treaty are the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of their use, in harmony with the Convention on Biological Diversity. </p>\n<p>The Protocol provides greater legal certainty and transparency for both providers and users of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, and therefore, encourages the advancement of research on genetic resources which could lead to new discoveries for the benefit of all. </p>\n<p>The Nagoya Protocol also creates incentives to conserve and sustainably use genetic resources, and thereby enhances the contribution of biodiversity to development and human well-being. In addition, Parties to the Protocol are to encourage users and providers to direct benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources towards the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its components.</p>\n<p>The International Treaty has established the Multilateral System of Access and Benefit-sharing, which facilitates exchanges of plant genetic resources for purposes of agricultural research and breeding, by providing a transparent and reliable framework for the exchange of crop genetic resources. The Multilateral System is instrumental to achieving the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their use. </p>"}
