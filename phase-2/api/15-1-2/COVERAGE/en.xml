	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 15-1-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator has been classified by the IAEG-SDGs as Tier 1. Current data are available for all countries in the world, and these are updated on an ongoing basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~150 years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that data for the global indicator are compiled at national levels, it is straightforward to disaggregate to national and regional levels (e.g., Han et al. 2014), or conversely to aggregate to the global level. Key Biodiversity Areas span all ecosystem types, including marine (Edgar et al. 2008), freshwater (Holland et al. 2012), and mountains (Rodr&amp;#xED;guez-Rodr&amp;#xED;guez et al. 2011). The indicator can therefore be reported in combination across terrestrial and freshwater (and indeed marine) systems, or disaggregated among them. However, individual Key Biodiversity Areas can encompass terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems simultaneously, and so determining the results is not simply additive. Finally, the indicator can be disaggregated according to different protected area management categories (categories I&amp;#x2013;VI) to reflect differing specific management objectives of protected areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the aggregation of the coverage of protected areas across important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity as an indicator towards SDG 15.1, other disaggregations of coverage of protected areas of particular relevance as indicators towards SDG targets (Brooks et al. 2016) include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SDG 14.5.1 Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SDG 15.4.1 Coverage by protected areas of important sites for mountain biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protected area coverage data can be combined with other data sources to yield further, complementary, indicators. For example, protected area overlay with ecoregional maps can be used to provide information on protected area coverage of different broad biogeographical regions. Protected area coverage of the distributions of different groups of species (e.g., mammals, birds, amphibians) can similarly provide indicators of trends in coverage of biodiversity at the species level. Protected area coverage can be combined with the Red List Index to generate indicators of the impacts of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss (Butchart et al. 2012). Finally, indicators derived from protected area overlay can also inform sustainable urban development; for example, the overlay of protected areas onto urban maps could provide an indicator of public space as a proportion of overall city space.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
