In September 2018, an agreement was reached on a verbal definition of the global minimum proficiency level of reference for each of the areas and domains of Indicator 4.1.1 as described in the <a href=\"http://gaml.uis.unesco.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/MPLs_revised_doc_20190204.docx\">Minimum Proficiency Levels (MPLs): Outcomes of the consensus building meeting</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Minimum proficiency levels defined by each learning assessment</em></p>\n<p>To ensure comparability across learning assessments, a verbal definition of MPL for each domain and levels between cross-national assessments (CNAs) was established by conducting an analysis of the performance level descriptors (PLDs)<sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-ref-1\">[1]</a></sup> of cross-national, regional, and community-led tests in reading and mathematics. The analysis was led and completed by the UIS and a consensus among experts on the proposed methodology was deemed adequate and pragmatic.</p>\n<p>The global MPL definitions for the domains of reading and mathematics are presented in Table 1.</p>\n<h2>Table 1.

However, these outcomes are not comparable across different cross-national learning assessments or with national learning assessments. A level of comparability of learning outcomes across assessments could be achieved by using different methodologies, each with varying standard errors. The period of 2020-2021 will shed light on the standard errors&#x2019; size for these methodologies. </p>\n<p>The comparability of learning outcomes over time has additional complications, which require, ideally, to design and implement a set of comparable items as anchors in advance. Methodological developments are underway to address comparability of assessments outcomes over time. </p><h1>Methodology</h1>\n<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n<p>The number of children and/or young people at the relevant stage of education n in year t achieving or exceeding the pre-defined proficiency level in subject s expressed as a percentage of the number of children and/or young people at stage of education n, in year t, in any proficiency level in subject s.</p>\n<p>MPL<sub>t,n,s,</sub> = MP<sub>t,n,s</sub> / P<sub>t,n</sub></p>\n<p>where: </p>\n<p>MP<sub>t,n,s</sub> = the number of children and young people at stage of education n, in year t, who have achieved or exceeded the minimum proficiency level in subject s. </p>\n<p>P<sub>t,n </sub>= the number of children and young people at stage of education n, in year t, in any proficiency level in subject s.</p>\n<p>n = the stage of education that was assessed</p>\n<p>s = the subject that was assessed (reading or mathematics).</p>\n<h2>Harmonize various data sources</h2>\n<p>To address the challenges posed by the limited capacity of some countries to implement cross-national, regional, and national assessments, actions have been taken by the UIS and its partners. The strategies are used according to its level of precision and following a <a href=\"http://gaml.uis.unesco.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/GAML6-WD-2-Protocol-for-reporting-4.1.1_v1.pdf\">reporting protocol</a> that includes the national assessments under specific circumstances. </p>\n<h2>Out-of-school children </h2>\n<p>In 2016, 263 million children, adolescents and youth were out of school, representing nearly one-fifth of the global population of this age group. 63 million, or 24% of the total, are children of primary school age (typically 6 to 11 years old); 61 million, or 23% of the total, are adolescents of lower secondary school age (typically 12 to 14 years old); and 139 million, or 53% of the total, are youth of upper secondary school age (about 15 to 17 years old). Not all these kids will be permanently outside school, some will re-join the educational system and, eventually, complete late, while some of them will enter late. The quantity varies per country and region and demands some adjustment in the estimate of Indicator 4.1.1. There is currently a discussion on how to implement these adjustments to reflect all the population. In 2017, the <a href=\"http://uis.unesco.org/en/blog/helping-countries-improve-their-data-out-school-children\"><u>UIS proposed to make adjustments using the out-of-school children (OOSC)</u></a><sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[2]</a></sup></sup> and the completion rates. </p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">2</sup><p> UIS (2017a).
