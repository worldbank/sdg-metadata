{"status":"success","message":"The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 2-1-1, translated into en","data":"<h2>Sources of discrepancies: </h2>\n<p>Many countries have produced and reported on estimates of the Prevalence of Undernourishment, including in their national MDG Reports, but almost invariably using a different methodology than the one developed by FAO, which makes national figures not comparable to those reported by FAO for global monitoring. </p>\n<p>The most common approach used in preparing national reports has been to calculate the percentage of households for which the average per capita daily dietary energy consumption is found to be below thresholds based on daily Recommended Dietary Intake, usually set at 2,100.00 kcal, based on household survey data. In some cases, also lower thresholds of around 1,400.00 kcal have been used, probably as a reaction to the fact that percentages of households reporting average daily consumption of less than 2,100.00 kcal per capita were implausibly high estimates of the prevalence of undernourishment. </p>\n<p>Almost without exception, no consideration related to the presence of excess variability in the dietary energy consumption data is made, and the reports reveal limited or no progress in the reduction of PoU over time. </p>\n<p>As discussed in the section on the method of computation, the results obtained through these alternative methods are highly unreliable and almost certainly biased toward overestimation. It is therefore advisable that a concerted effort is made to advocate for use of the FAO methods also in preparation of national reports. FAO stands ready to provide all necessary technical support. </p>"}
