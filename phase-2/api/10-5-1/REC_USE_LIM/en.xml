	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 10-5-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Comments and limitations:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data for most countries are reported on a monthly or quarterly basis; a few countries report data on a semi-annual basis and with a lag of more than a quarter. As of end-December 2018, there were 138 FSI reporters. Some countries&amp;#x2019; compilation practices deviate from the FSI Guide methodology in certain areas and are documented in the FSI metadata also posted on the IMF&amp;#x2019;s FSI website. Reporting countries provide all or most core FSIs and some encouraged FSIs that can be used to support the interpretation of these seven SDG indicators. FSI data and metadata reported by countries are available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.imf.org/FSI.&quot;&gt;http://data.imf.org/FSI.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</data>
