{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 3-9-2, translated into en","data":"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n<p>Data rely on (a) statistics on WASH services (6.1, 6.2 and 6.3), which are well assessed in almost all countries, and (b) data on deaths. Data on deaths are also widely available from countries from death registration data or sample registration systems, which are certainly feasible systems. Such data are crucial for improving health and reducing preventable deaths in countries. The main limitation is that not all countries do have such registration systems to date, and data need to be completed with other type of information.</p>"}
