	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 17-8-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the indicator is available for 100 countries at least from one survey in the years 2011-2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ITU makes the indicator available for each year for 200 economies by using survey data and estimates for almost all countries of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For countries that collect this data on the proportion of individuals using the Internet through an official survey, and if data allow breakdown and disaggregation, the indicator can be broken down by region (geographic and/or urban/rural), by sex, by age group, by educational level, by labour force status, and by occupation. ITU collects data for all of these breakdowns from countries.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
