	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 5-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Comments and limitations:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator&amp;apos;s main limitation is that it does not reflect differences in the levels of responsibility of women in these high- and middle-level positions or the characteristics of the enterprises and organizations in which they are employed. Its quality is also heavily dependent on the reliability of the employment statistics by occupation at the ISCO two-digit level.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
