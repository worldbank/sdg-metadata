	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 4-1-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary completion rate is currently available for 122 countries, representing 51% of all countries worldwide. The lower secondary completion rate is available for 155 countries, representing 64% of all countries. Coverage for the upper secondary completion rate is similar, with data for 155 countries, representing 64% of all countries. The countries with completion rates are home to more than 90% of the global population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time series:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The completion rate is available for the years since 2000. National time series are incomplete due to the infrequent implementation of household surveys and censuses but could, potentially, be reconstructed using the aforementioned model-based to estimate the completion rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is disaggregated by sex, location, wealth and other dimensions specified in global indicator 4.5.1 (parity index). &lt;/p&gt;</data>
