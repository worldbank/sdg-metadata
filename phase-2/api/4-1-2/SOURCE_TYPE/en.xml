&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data can be obtained from population censuses and household surveys that collect information on the highest level of education completed by children and young people in a household. Typical questions in a survey to collect data on educational attainment are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the highest level of education [name of household member] has attended?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the highest grade of education [name of household member] has completed at that level?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources include publicly available data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), European Union Statistics on Income and Living Condition (EU-SILC), the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS), and national household surveys and censuses.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
