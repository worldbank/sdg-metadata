	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Collection process:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from all publicly available household surveys and censuses with the required information are compiled and used to calculate the completion rate. For international comparability, national data are mapped to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) before indicator calculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicator values intended for dissemination and addition to the global SDG Indicators Database are submitted by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics to National Statistical Offices, Ministries of Education or other relevant agencies in individual countries for their review and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
