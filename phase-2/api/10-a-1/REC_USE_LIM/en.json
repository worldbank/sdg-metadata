{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 10-a-1, translated into en","data":"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n<p>The following caveats should be taken in consideration while reviewing this indicator:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Accurate estimates on special and differential treatment for developing countries do not exist, thus the calculations are limited to tariffs only. These are only part of the trade limitation factors, especially when looking at exports of developing or least developed countries under non-reciprocal preferential treatment that set criteria for eligibility.</li>\n  <li>A full coverage of preferential schemes of developed countries are used for the computation, but preferential treatment may not be fully used by developing countries&apos; exporters for different reasons such as the inability of certain exporters to meet eligibility criteria (i.e., complying with rules of origin). As there is no accurate statistical information on the extent of the actual utilisation of each of these preferences, it is assumed that they are fully utilised.</li>\n  <li>Duty free treatment is an indicator of market access, but is not always synonymous with preferential treatment for beneficiary countries, because a number of MFN tariffs are already at, or close to, zero, especially for fuels and minerals. International agreements on IT products also offer duty-free treatment for components and equipment used for production purpose.</li>\n</ul>"}
