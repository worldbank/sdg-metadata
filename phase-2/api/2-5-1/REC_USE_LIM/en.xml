	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 2-5-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Comments and limitations:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plant genetic resources&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadly, two issues are of concern in using the &amp;#x201C;number of accessions&amp;#x201D; as an indicator of diversity in &lt;em&gt;ex situ&lt;/em&gt; collections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undetected duplicates of accessions may contribute to an increase of the indicator, as each accession is a managed unit, kept and recorded as distinct. The detection of such duplicates will therefore result in a reduction in the number of accession previously reported. This can occur at different levels, for example within genebank collections and also at international level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A loss of viability of the material(s) conserved that is not promptly detected may similarly not be reflected in the number of accessions, contributing to an overestimate of the actual number of accessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information could be provided by other indicators measuring &lt;em&gt;ex situ&lt;/em&gt; conservation, which are part of the monitoring of the implementation of the Global Plan of Action for PGRFA under the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal genetic resources&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information on cryoconserved material in the Domestic Animal Diversity Information System DAD-IS needs to be updated on a regular base.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
