&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sub-indicators 1 to 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAO has been monitoring the world&amp;apos;s forests at 5 to 10 year intervals since 1946. The Global Forest Resources Assessments (FRA) are now produced every five year. The latest of these assessments, FRA 2020, contains information for 236 countries and territories on about 60 variables related to the extent of forests, their conditions, uses and values for several points in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sub-indicator 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on forest certification is submitted annually to FAO by the head offices of the respective forest certification scheme. Data include the area certified by each scheme, as well as areas that are double-certified by the two main schemes. That allows for estimating the total certified forest area, adjusted for double certified area. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
