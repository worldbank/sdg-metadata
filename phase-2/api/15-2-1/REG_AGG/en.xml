	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Regional aggregates: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See Annex 2 &amp;#x2013; Methodology. It should be noted that for those sub-indicators where there are gaps in the data set, only the countries with complete data for the relevant years (either provided by the countries or estimated by FAO) are included in the regional and global aggregates. Annex 2 also shows how the dashboard traffic lights are applied at global and regional level. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
