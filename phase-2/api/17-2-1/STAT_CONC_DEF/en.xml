	<message>The STAT_CONC_DEF field for indicator 17-2-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Concepts and definitions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definition:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator Net official development assistance, total and to least developed countries, as a proportion of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee donors&amp;apos; gross national income (GNI) is defined as Net ODA disbursements as a per cent of GNI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ODA:&lt;/strong&gt; The DAC defines ODA as &amp;#x201C;those flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are i) provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent). (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GNI&lt;/strong&gt; is obtained by DAC reporters from their national statistical offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Since 2018, the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD measures the headline ODA data as of 2018 on a grant equivalent basis. See references for more details.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
