	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Regional aggregates:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because surveys are not conducted every year in most countries, poverty estimates have to be derived for line-up years by interpolation or extrapolation using national accounts data. These estimates for line-up years are then aggregated to regional and global numbers. Regional and global aggregates are population-weighted averages.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
