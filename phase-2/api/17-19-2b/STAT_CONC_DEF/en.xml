	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Concepts and definitions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definition:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This information only refers to 17.19.2 (b): Proportion of countries that have achieved 100 per cent birth registration and 80 per cent death registration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Principles and Recommendations for a Vital Statistics System, Revision 3 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/standmeth/principles/M19Rev3en.pdf&quot;&gt;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/standmeth/principles/M19Rev3en.pdf&lt;/a&gt;), a complete civil registration is defined as: &amp;#x201C;The registration in the civil registration system of every vital event that has occurred to the members of the population of a particular country (or area), within a specified period as a result of which every such event has a vital registration record and the system has attained 100 per cent coverage.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a given country or area, the level of completeness of birth registration can be different from the level of completeness of death registration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There exist several methods for the evaluation of completeness of birth or death registration systems. An elaboration of these methods is available at Principles and Recommendations for a Vital Statistics System, Revision 3. The evaluation and monitoring of quality and completeness of birth and death registration systems are addressed in Part three, sub-Chapters: D. Quality assessment methods; E. Direct versus indirect assessment, and F. Choosing appropriate methods for assessing completeness and qualitative accuracy of registration and register-based vital statistics (para 579 to 622).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicator 17.19.2(b) has two parts; the first concerning the birth registration and the second concerning the death registration of each individual country or area. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
