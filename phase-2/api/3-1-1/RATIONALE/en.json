{"status":"success","message":"The RATIONALE field for indicator 3-1-1, translated into en","data":"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n<p>All maternal mortality indicators derived from the 2019 estimation round include a point-estimate and an 80% uncertainty interval (UI). Data are available and can be downloaded from the webpage &#x201C;maternal mortality &#x2013; levels and trends 2000-2017: <a href=\"http://mmr2017.srhr.org\">http://mmr2017.srhr.org</a>. Both point-estimates and 80% UIs should be taken into account when assessing estimates.</p>\n<p>For example: </p>\n<p>The estimated 2017 global MMR is 211 (UI 199 to 243)</p>\n<p>This means:</p>\n<p>&#x2022; The point-estimate is 211 and the 80% uncertainty interval ranges 199 to 243.</p>\n<p>&#x2022; There is a 50% chance that the true 2017 global MMR lies above 211, and a 50% chance that the true value lies below 211.</p>\n<p>&#x2022; There is an 80% chance that the true 2017 global MMR lies between 199 and 243.</p>\n<p>&#x2022; There is still a 10% chance that the true 2017 global MMR lies above 243, and a 10% chance that the true value lies below 199.</p>\n<p>Other accurate interpretations include:</p>\n<p>&#x2022; We are 90% certain that the true 2017 global MMR is at least 199.</p>\n<p>&#x2022; We are 90% certain that the true 2017 global MMR is 243 or less.</p>\n<p>The amount of data available for estimating an indicator and the quality of that data determine the width of an indicator&#x2019;s UI. As data availability and quality improve, the certainty increases that an indicator&#x2019;s true value lies close to the point-estimate.</p>"}
