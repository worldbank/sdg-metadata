	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Collection process:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MMEIG maintains an input database consisting of maternal mortality data from civil registration, population-based surveys, surveillance systems, censuses, and other specialized studies/surveys. This database is used to determine the number of maternal deaths and where possible the number of deaths among all women of reproductive age (WRA) to calculate the &amp;quot;PM&amp;quot; proportion of maternal deaths among WRA. The MMR is then calculated as MMR = PM(D/B); where &amp;quot;D&amp;quot; is the number of deaths in women aged 15-49 (WRA) and &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; is the number of live births. The number of live births is based upon the World Population Prospects 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistical modelling is undertaken to generate comparable country, regional, and global level estimates. The model&amp;apos;s fit is assessed by cross-validation. Estimates are then reviewed with Member States through a WHO country consultation process and SDG focal points. In 2001, the WHO Executive Board endorsed a resolution (EB. 107.R8) seeking to &amp;#x201C;establish a technical consultation process bringing together personnel and perspectives from Member States in different WHO regions&amp;#x201D;. A key objective of this consultation process is &amp;#x201C;to ensure that each Member State is consulted on the best data to be used&amp;#x201D;. Since the process is an integral step in the overall estimation strategy, it is described here in brief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country consultation process entails an exchange between WHO and technical focal person(s) in each country. It is carried out prior to the publication of estimates. During the consultation period, WHO invites focal person(s) to review input data sources, methods for estimation and the preliminary estimates. Focal person(s) are encouraged to submit additional data that may not have been taken into account in the preliminary estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjustments are made according to the data source type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) CRVS, for incompleteness and misclassification of maternal deaths&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) reports providing &amp;quot;pregnancy-related&amp;quot; mortality, for underreporting of these deaths, as well as over-reporting of maternal deaths due to inclusion of deaths which are accidental or incidental to pregnancy (thus outside of the definition of maternal mortality). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis also accounts for stochastic errors due to the general rarity of maternal deaths, sampling error in the data source, errors during data collection and processing, and other random error.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
