{"status":"success","message":"The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 8-2-1, translated into en","data":"<h1>Data sources</h1>\n<h2>Description:</h2>\n<p>Output measures used in the numerator of this indicator (Gross Domestic Product) are best obtained from the production side of national accounts and represent, as much as possible, GDP at market prices for the aggregate economy (adjusted for inflation, in constant prices).</p>\n<p>Employment data used in the denominator are preferably derived from labour force or other household surveys with an employment module. In the absence of a household survey, establishment surveys, administrative records or official estimates based on reliable sources can be used as well as population censuses. It is however important to note that employment data from establishment surveys will capture the number of jobs and not the number of persons employed as preferred for the denominator. Also, establishment surveys cover, in many cases, the formal sector and employers and employees only, not accounting for the whole economy.</p>\n<p>When calculating this indicator, it is important to ensure that the coverage of the employment data is consistent with that of the national accounts.</p>"}
