&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preferred data source is a household survey with variables that can reliably identify both the poverty status of households and the economic activity of the household&amp;#x2019;s members. Examples include household income and expenditure surveys (HIES), living standards measurement surveys (LSMS) with employment modules, or labour force surveys (LFS) that collect information on household income. Such surveys offer the benefit of allowing the employment status and income (or consumption expenditure) variables to be derived from the same sampled households ideally for the same observation period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employment estimates derived from a household survey other than a labour force survey may, however, not be the most robust due to questionnaire design. Similarly, a labour force survey may not be the best instrument for collecting household income or consumption expenditure data, although an attached income module can be designed to achieve statistically reliable results, including ensuring an overlap in the observation period between household income (or consumption expenditure) and employment status. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is to combine data from a household income and expenditure survey and from a separate labour force survey when the respondent households can be matched and consistency in the long observation period between the surveys can be obtained.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
