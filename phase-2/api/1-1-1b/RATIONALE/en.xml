&lt;p&gt;In order to eradicate poverty, we must understand the root causes of poverty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The working poverty rate reveals the proportion of the employed population living in poverty despite being employed, implying that their employment-related incomes are not sufficient to lift them and their families out of poverty and ensure decent living conditions. The adequacy of earnings is a fundamental aspect of job quality, and these deficits in job quality could be keeping workers and their families in poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proportion of working poor in total employment (that is, the working poverty rate) combines data on household income or consumption with labour force framework variables measured at the individual level and sheds light on the relationship between employment and household poverty.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
