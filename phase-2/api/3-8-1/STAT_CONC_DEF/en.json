The 14 indicators are listed below and detailed metadata for each of the components are given online (<a href=\"http://www.who.int/healthinfo/universal_health_coverage/UHC_Tracer_Indicators_Metadata.pdf\">http://www.who.int/healthinfo/universal_health_coverage/UHC_Tracer_Indicators_Metadata.pdf</a>) and Annex 1. The tracer indicators are as follows, organized by four broad categories of service coverage:</p>\n<p><strong><em>I. Reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health</em></strong></p>\n<p>1. <strong>Family planning</strong>: Percentage of women of reproductive age (15&#x2212;49 years) who are married or in-union who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods </p>\n<p>2. <strong>Pregnancy and delivery care</strong>: Percentage of women aged 15-49 years with a live birth in a given time period who received antenatal care four or more times</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Child immunization</strong>: Percentage of infants receiving three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis containing vaccine</p>\n<p>4. <strong>Child treatment</strong>: Percentage of children under 5 years of age with suspected pneumonia (cough and difficult breathing NOT due to a problem in the chest and a blocked nose) in the two weeks preceding the survey taken to an appropriate health facility or provider</p>\n<p><strong><em>II. Infectious diseases</em></strong></p>\n<p>5. <strong>Tuberculosis</strong>: Percentage of incident TB cases that are detected and successfully treated</p>\n<p>6. <strong>HIV/AIDS</strong>: Percentage of people living with HIV currently receiving antiretroviral therapy</p>\n<p>7. <strong>Malaria</strong>: Percentage of population in malaria-endemic areas who slept under an insecticide-treated net the previous night [only for countries with high malaria burden]</p>\n<p>8. <strong>Water and sanitation</strong>: Percentage of households using at least basic sanitation facilities</p>\n<p><strong><em>III. Noncommunicable diseases</em></strong></p>\n<p>9. <strong>Hypertension</strong>: Age-standardized prevalence of non-raised blood pressure (systolic blood pressure &lt;140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm Hg) among adults aged 18 years and older</p>\n<p>10. <strong>Diabetes</strong>: Age-standardized mean fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) for adults aged 18 years and older</p>\n<p>11. <strong>Tobacco</strong>: Age-standardized prevalence of adults &gt;=15 years not smoking tobacco in last 30 days (SDG indicator 3.a.1, metadata available <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-03-0a-01.pdf\">here</a>)</p>\n<p><strong><em>IV. Service capacity and access</em></strong></p>\n<p>12. <strong>Hospital access</strong>: Hospital beds per capita, relative to a maximum threshold of 18 per 10,000 population</p>\n<p>13. <strong>Health workforce</strong>: Health professionals (physicians, psychiatrists, and surgeons) per capita, relative to maximum thresholds for each cadre (partial overlap with SDG indicator 3.c.1, see metadata <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-03-0C-01.pdf\">here</a>)</p>\n<p>14. <strong>Health security</strong>: International Health Regulations (IHR) core capacity index, which is the average percentage of attributes of 13 core capacities that have been attained (SDG indicator 3.d.1, see metadata <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-03-0D-01.pdf\">here</a>)</p>"}
