&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the tracer indicators of health service coverage are measured by household surveys. However, administrative data, facility data, facility surveys, and sentinel surveillance systems are utilized for certain indicators. Underlying data sources for each of the 14 tracer indicators are explained in more detail in Annex 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of values used to compute the index, values are taken from existing published sources. This includes assembled data sets and estimates from various UN agencies. This is summarized in the above link.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
