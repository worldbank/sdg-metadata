	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 17-1-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Rationale and interpretation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiscal policy is the use of the level and composition of the general government and public sectors&amp;#x2019; spending and revenue&amp;#x2014;and the related accumulation of government assets and liabilities&amp;#x2014;to achieve such goals as the stabilization of the economy, the reallocation of resources, and the redistribution of income. In addition to revenue mobilization, government units may also finance a portion of their activities in a specific period by borrowing or by acquiring funds from sources other than compulsory transfers&amp;#x2014;for example, interest revenue, incidental sales of goods and services, or the rent of subsoil assets. Indicator 17.1.1 Total government revenue as a proportion of GDP, by source supports understanding countries&amp;#x2019; domestic revenue mobilization in the form of tax and nontax sources. The indicator will provide analysts with a cross-country comparable dataset that highlights the relationship between the four main types of revenue as well as the relative &amp;quot;tax burden&amp;quot; (revenue in the form of taxes) and &amp;#x201C;fiscal burden&amp;#x201D; (revenue in the form of taxes plus social contributions).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
