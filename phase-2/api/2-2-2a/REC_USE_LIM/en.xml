	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Comments and limitations:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Survey estimates come with levels of uncertainty due to both sampling error and non-sampling error (e.g. mesasurement technical error, recording error etc.,). None of the two sources of errros have been fully taken into account for deriving estimates neither at country nor at regional and global levels. Of particular concern for overweight is the fact that data for high income countries are scarce yet the rates are generally higher among the high income countries with data and so the lack of representation from high income countries may affect the global and even regional rates.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
