Each agency uses their existing mechanisms for obtaining data.</p>\n<p>For WHO, see published database methodology (de Onis et al. 2004). For UNICEF, the cadre of dedicated data and monitoring specialists working at national, regional and international levels in 190 countries routinely provide technical support for the collection and analysis of data. For the past 20 years UNICEF has undertaken an annual process to update its global databases, called Country Reporting on Indicators for Goals (CRING). This exercise is done in close collaboration with UNICEF country offices with the purpose of ensuring that UNICEF global databases contain updated and internationally comparable data. UNICEF country offices are invited to submit, through an online system, nationally representative data for over 100 key indicators on the well-being of women and children, including stunting. The country office staff work with local counterparts to ensure the most relevant data are shared. Updates sent by the country offices are then reviewed by sector specialists at UNICEF headquarters to check for consistency and overall data quality of the submitted estimates and re-analysis where possible. This review is based on a set of objective criteria to ensure that only the most reliable information is included in the databases. Once reviewed, feedback is made available on whether or not specific data points are accepted, and if not, the reasons why. UNICEF uses these data obtained through CRING to feed into the joint dataset. The World Bank Group provides estimates availabe through the Living Standard Measurement Surveys (LSMS) which ussually requires re-analysis of datasets given theat the LSMS reports often do not tabulate the stunting data. </p>"}
