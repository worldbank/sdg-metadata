&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monitoring progress on meeting SDG 6.5 is owned by and is the responsibility of the national government. The government will assign a ministry with the primary responsibility for overseeing this survey, which will be asked to take on the responsibility of coordinating the national IWRM monitoring and reporting process. As water management issues cut across a wide number of sectors, often overseen by different ministries and other administrative bodies at national or other levels, the process should be inclusive. Major stakeholders should be involved in order to contribute to well informed and objective answers to the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministry is invited to nominate a national &amp;#x201C;IWRM focal point&amp;#x201D;, who may or may not be a government official. The UN will provide support where needed and possible. The following steps are suggested as guidance only, as it is up to countries to decide which process or processes would best serve their needs. It should also be noted that the following steps represent a &amp;#x2018;ladder&amp;#x2019; approach, in that completing all the steps will generally lead to a more robust indicator. However, it may not be possible or necessary for all countries to complete all steps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The responsible ministry or IWRM focal point contacts other relevant ministries/agencies to compile responses to the questionnaire. Each possible response option has a score which will be used to calculate the overall indicator score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The completed draft survey is reviewed by government stakeholders. These stakeholders could include those involved in water-relevant sectors, such as agriculture, energy, water supply and environment, as well as water management at different administrative levels. This process may be electronic (e.g. via email) and/or through workshops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The revised draft survey is validated at a multi-stakeholder workshop. Apart from government representatives these stakeholders could include water user associations, private sector, interest groups concerned with e.g. environment, agriculture, poverty, and academia. The suggested process is through a workshop but alternative means of consultation e.g. email or online call for public submissions could be considered. Note that steps 2 and 3 could be combined if desired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. The responsible ministry or IWRM focal point discusses with relevant officials and consolidates the input into a final version. This version is the basis for calculating the degree of IWRM implementation (0-100) for global reporting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. The responsible ministry submits the final indicator score to the national statistics office responsible for compiling all national SDG target data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the national survey, UN-Water will periodically prepare synthesis reports for regional and global levels to provide overall progress on meeting SDG target 6.5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temporal Coverage: A reporting cycle of three years is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
