	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 6-5-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Comments and limitations:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge of subjectivity in responses associated with this type of survey is being addressed in a number of ways: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Draft responses are reviewed by a number of governmental and non-governmental stakeholders in an open, inclusive and transparent process. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Countries are encouraged to provide further information to qualify their responses and/or set them in the national context. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Guidelines are provided for each of the four main sections, each question, and each of the six thresholds for every single question, to ensure responses are as objective as possible, and are comparable both between countries, and between reporting periods. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve robust indicator results requires a country process involving a wide range of stakeholders which will require a certain amount of time and resources. The advantage of this is that it puts in place a process that addresses the integrated and indivisible nature of the SDG targets, as well as stressing the importance of &amp;#x201C;leaving no on behind&amp;#x201D;.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
