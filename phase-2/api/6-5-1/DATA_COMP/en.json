The survey contains 33 questions divided into the four main sections described above. </p>\n<p>2. Each question is given a score between 0 and 100, in increments of 10, guided by threshold descriptions for the following 6 categories:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Very low (0)</li>\n  <li>Low (20)</li>\n  <li>Medium-low (40)</li>\n  <li>Medium-high (60)</li>\n  <li>High (80)</li>\n  <li>Very high (100)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that guidance is provided for each threshold for each question, to ensure objective and comparable results. </p>\n<p>3. The un-weighted average of the question scores within each of the four sections is calculated to give a score of 0 &#x2013; 100 for each section, rounded to the nearest whole number. </p>\n<p>4. The section scores (rounded to the nearest whole number), are averaged (un-weighted), and rounded to the nearest whole number, to give the indicator score, expressed as a number between 0 and 100.</p>"}
