	<message>The DATA_SOURCE field for indicator 6-5-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data providers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information required to complete the survey is expected to be held by government officials responsible for water resources management in the country, supported by official documentation. E.g. Ministry of Water in coordination with Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Lands and Agriculture, Ministry of Industry and Mining etc. See also &amp;#x2018;data sources&amp;#x2019; section above. As a minimum, a small group of officials may be able to complete the survey. However, these government officials may belong to various government authorities, and coordination will be required to determine and validate the responses to each question. Increased government and non-government stakeholder participation in validating the question scores will lead to a more robust indicator score and facilitate tracking progress over time.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
