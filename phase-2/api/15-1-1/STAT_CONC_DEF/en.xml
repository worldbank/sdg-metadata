&lt;h2&gt;Definition:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forest area as a proportion of total land area&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to provide a precise definition of the indicator, it is crucial to provide a definition of &amp;#x201C;Forest&amp;#x201D; and &amp;#x201C;Total Land Area&amp;#x201D;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the FAO definitions, Forest is defined as: &amp;#x201C;land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use&amp;#x201D;. More specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of other predominant land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 meters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It includes areas with young trees that have not yet reached but which are expected to reach a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of 5 meters or more. It also includes areas that are temporarily unstocked due to clear-cutting as part of a forest management practice or natural disasters, and which are expected to be regenerated within 5 years. Local conditions may, in exceptional cases, justify that a longer time frame is used.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those of specific environmental, scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It includes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectares and width of more than 20 meters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It includes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of trees that have, or are expected to reach, a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of at least 5 meters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It includes areas with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless whether this area is classified as land area or not.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It includes rubberwood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height and canopy cover criteria are met.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive orchards and agroforestry systems when crops are grown under tree cover. Note: Some agroforestry systems such as the &amp;#x201C;Taungya&amp;#x201D; system where crops are grown only during the first years of the forest rotation should be classified as forest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total land area is the total surface area of a country less the area covered by inland waters, like major rivers and lakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is expressed as percent.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
