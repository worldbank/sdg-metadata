This reporter is usually located in the national aid agency, Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Finance etc.</p>\n<p>B) Information for the PINE database is collected via a network of 200 country experts, including in government agencies (Ministries of Finance and Environment, statistical institutes) as well as research institutes and international organisations. Data is collected systematically for 37 OECD members as well as the active accession countries. A growing number of non-member countries also provide information. Registered experts are asked to update data at least once a year, typically in January or February, through a password-protected interface. The data collection method may result in some reporting bias, as OECD members and active accession countries are likely to report more data on a regular basis, and all figures should be interpreted in this context. </p>\n<p>The OECD Secretariat, in consultation with countries, validates the data before they are published online. The management of PINE is overseen by OECD Committees and Working Parties.</p>"}
