&lt;p&gt;Data on health workers tend to be more complete for the public health sector and may underestimate the active workforce in the private, military, nongovernmental organization and faith-based health sectors. In many cases, information maintained at the national regulatory bodies and professional councils are not updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As data is not always published annually for each country, the latest available data has been used. Due to the differences in data sources, considerable variability remains across countries in the coverage, periodicity, quality and completeness of the original data. Densities are calculated using national population estimates from the United Nations Population Division&amp;apos;s World Population Prospects database and may vary from densities produced by the country.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
