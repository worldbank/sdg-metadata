In addition to the reporting, the platform also serves as an analytical tool at the national/regional and global levels. Since Its launch in November 2017, Member States are called to use the NHWA data platform to report health workforce data. Complementing the national reporting through the NHWA data platform, additional sources such as the National Census, Labour Force Surveys and key administrative national and regional sources are also employed. Most of the data from administrative sources are derived from published national health sector reviews and/or official country reports to WHO offices. Countries with missing data for the year 2016 (baseline value for reporting of the WHO 13th Global Programme of Work) were estimated from a linear model of density time trend based on at least five data points including one reported density in the period 2011-2013.</p><h1>Calendar</h1>\n<h2><strong>Data collection:</strong></h2>\n<p>Ongoing process</p><h2><strong>Data release:</strong> </h2>\n<p>First quarter of 2020</p><h1>Data providers</h1>\n<p> NHWA focal point at national level</p><h1>Data compilers</h1>\n<p>WHO</p><h2><strong>Comments and limitations:</strong></h2>\n<p>Data on health workers tend to be more complete for the public health sector and may underestimate the active workforce in the private, military, nongovernmental organization and faith-based health sectors. In many cases, information maintained at the national regulatory bodies and professional councils are not updated.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As data is not always published annually for each country, the latest available data has been used. Due to the differences in data sources, considerable variability remains across countries in the coverage, periodicity, quality and completeness of the original data. Densities are calculated using national population estimates from the United Nations Population Division&apos;s World Population Prospects database and may vary from densities produced by the country.</p><h1>Methodology</h1>\n<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n<p><strong>Health worker densities by occupation:</strong></p>\n<p>The figures for number of medical doctors (including generalist and specialist medical practitioners) depending on the nature of the original data source may include practising medical doctors only or all registered medical doctors.</p>\n<p>The figures for number of nursing and midwifery include nursing personnel and midwifery personnel, whenever available. In many countries, nurses trained with midwifery skills are counted and reported as nurses. This makes the distinction between nursing personnel and midwifery personnel difficult to draw.</p>\n<p>The figures for number of dentists include dentists in the given national and/or subnational area. Depending on the nature of the original data source may include practising (active) only or all registered in the health occupation.

In cases where the official health workforce report provides density indicators instead of counts, estimates of the stock were then calculated using the population estimated from the United Nations Population Division&apos;s World population prospects database (2017). </p>\n<p><strong>Health worker distribution by sex:</strong></p>\n<p>The number of male medical doctors as reported by the country is expressed as a percentage of total male and female medical doctors reported by the country</p>\n<p>The number of female medical doctors as reported by the country is expressed as a percentage of total male and female medical doctors reported by the country</p>\n<p>The number of male nursing personnel as reported by the country is expressed as a percentage of total male and female nursing personnel reported by the country</p>\n<p>The number of female nursing personnel as reported by the country is expressed as a percentage of total male and female nursing personnel reported by the country.</p><h2>Regional and global aggregates:</h2>\n<p>The global average density was estimated as the population weighted average of the national densities.</p>\n<p>For the regional average density, data for the countries with missing values in the period 2013-2018 were first estimated with neighbouring comparable countries.
