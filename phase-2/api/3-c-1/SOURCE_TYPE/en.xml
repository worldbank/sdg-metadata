&lt;p&gt;In response to WHA69.19, an online National Health Workforce Accounts (NHWA) data platform was developed to facilitate national reporting. In addition to the reporting, the platform also serves as an analytical tool at the national/regional and global levels. Since Its launch in November 2017, Member States are called to use the NHWA data platform to report health workforce data. Complementing the national reporting through the NHWA data platform, additional sources such as the National Census, Labour Force Surveys and key administrative national and regional sources are also employed. Most of the data from administrative sources are derived from published national health sector reviews and/or official country reports to WHO offices. Countries with missing data for the year 2016 (baseline value for reporting of the WHO 13th Global Programme of Work) were estimated from a linear model of density time trend based on at least five data points including one reported density in the period 2011-2013.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
