	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A) The Rio biodiversity marker was introduced in 2002 and data are available since then for most DAC members, with improvements in reporting over time. Not all other providers report their data at an activity level though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provisional data classification: Tier I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B) Currently more than 110 countries are contributing data to the PINE database. As of March 2020, the database contained more than 3 500 policy instruments for the environment, of which 3 100 were in force. The environmental domains covered by the database include biodiversity, climate, air pollution, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time series:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A) The data are available since 1996 on an annual basis, with time series since 1950.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B) The data series is annual and data is available from before 1980. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PINE database exists since 1996, with the added feature of tagging biodiversity-relevant instruments introduced in 2017. The biodiversity-relevant information in the PINE database is being used to monitor progress towards Aichi Target 3 on positive incentives, under the Convention on Biological Diversity. For more information on this, see Aichi Target 3 under the website of the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership (BIP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A) This indicator can be disaggregated by donor, by recipient country (or region), by type of finance, by type of aid, by sub-sector, by policy marker (e.g. gender), etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B) Information is available by country at the individual policy instrument level.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
