&lt;p&gt;Data will be verified by UNWTO and any issues will be resolved through written communication with countries. In the case of the availability of TSA tables, it would also be possible to cross-validate with the information reported to UNWTO on SDG indicator 8.9.1 (Tourism Direct GDP) and the indicators collected via UNWTO&amp;#xB4;s annual data collection. The availability reported on SEEA tables can also be cross-checked with information available to UNSD.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
