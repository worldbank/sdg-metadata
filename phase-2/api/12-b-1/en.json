It adopts the basic system of concepts, classifications, definitions, tables and aggregates of the System of National Accounts 2008 (SNA 2008). The UN Statistical Commission took note of the TSA: RMF 2008 document at its 39th session (26-29 February 2008). It updates and replaces the previous TSA:RMF 2000 which was approved by the United Nations Statistical Commission at its 31st session (29 February-3 March 2000).</p>\n<p>The concepts and template presentation tables related to water, energy, GHG emission and solid waste can be found in <a href=\"https://seea.un.org/content/methodology\"><em>System of Environmental-Economic Accounting - Central Framework</em></a> is an international statistical standard for measuring the environment and its relationship with the economy. It contains an internationally agreed set of standard concepts, definitions, classifications, accounting rules and tables to produce internationally comparable statistics. The UN Statistical Commission adopted the SEEA Central Framework at its 43<sup>rd</sup> session (28 February &#x2013; 2 March 2012). </p><h1>Data sources</h1>\n<h2>Description:</h2>\n<p>The indicator is sourced from countries&#x2019; Tourism Satellite Account and Environmental-Economic Accounts.</p><h2>Collection process:</h2>\n<p>UNWTO sends a short questionnaire to countries to obtain information on the number of relevant TSA and SEEA tables produced by countries.</p><h1>Calendar</h1>\n<p><strong>Data collection:</strong></p>\n<p>The exercise to collect data on TSA and SEEA tables implementation directly from countries through a UNWTO questionnaire was launched in August 2019 for the data available up to the end of the previous year.</p><h2>Data release:</h2>\n<p>First release will be in February 2020.</p><h1>Data providers</h1>\n<p>For the TSA: National Statistics Offices and/or National Tourism Administrations.</p>\n<p>For the SEEA: National Statistics Offices and/or environment ministries.</p><h1>Data compilers</h1>\n<p>World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) with input and in coordination with the UN Statistics Division especially with respect to the SEEA data.</p><h2>Rationale:</h2>\n<p>The UNWTO Committee on Statistics<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-ref-1\">[1]</a></sup></sup>, the leading international group in tourism statistics composed of experts from countries and international organizations, has since 2016 identified important difficulties with the original indicator: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The indicator does not track the target well.</li>\n  <li>The indicator is not statistically based. There is no internationally agreed statistical framework or concepts/definitions that can be applied to &#x201C;sustainable tourism strategies or policies and implemented action plans&#x201D;. </li>\n  <li>It is not clear what the relationship/boundary is between the three different instruments mentioned: &#x201C;strategies&#x201D;, &#x201C;policies&#x201D;, and &#x201C;implemented action plans&#x201D;. For example, a tourism master plan may contain elements of all three - would this count as 1 or 3? </li>\n  <li>There is no statistical infrastructure in place in countries for collecting this information, and it would seem difficult to develop it due to the above mentioned issues;</li>\n  <li>The absence of internationally agreed definitions on these concepts and of related statistical processes would mean that data collection, should it take place, would be affected by each country respondent&#x2019;s interpretation of the terms &#x201C;strategies&#x201D;, &#x201C;policies&#x201D;, and &#x201C;implemented action plans&#x201D;. This would be accentuated by the fact that country officials would need to be asked to self-assess their countries&#x2019; situation, leading to a significant respondent bias. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is thus proposed to focus on the target (&quot;develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable [tourism])&#x201D; and monitor the stage of implementation in countries of the main accounting tools <em>to date</em> for the international monitoring of key sustainability aspects of tourism which are:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>countries&#x2019; Tourism Satellite Account based on the <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/tradeserv/tourism/manual.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tourism Satellite Account: Recommended Methodological Framework 2008</em></a> (TSA: RMF 2008) and </li>\n  <li>countries&#x2019; water, energy, GHG emissions and waste accounts based the <a href=\"https://seea.un.org/content/seea-central-framework\"><em>System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA)</em></a>. </li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This yields a statistically-based indicator for monitoring target 12.b. by tracking the degree of implementation in countries of the TSA and SEEA tables that are most relevant and feasible for monitoring sustainability in tourism.</p>\n<p>This is in line with the <a href=\"http://statistics.unwto.org/mst\"><em>Measuring the Sustainability of Tourism (MST)</em></a> programme of work launched by UNWTO with the support of UNSD which includes the <a href=\"http://statistics.unwto.org/sf_mst\"><em>Statistical Framework for Measuring the Sustainability of Tourism (SF-MST)</em></a> currently under development as requested by the UN Statistical Commission in its 48<sup>th</sup> Session (7-10 March 2017)<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[2]</a></sup>. The SF-MST integrates tourism statistics with other economic, social and environmental information and provides a coherent base for deriving indicators that are relevant for monitoring and analysing the sustainability of tourism.
