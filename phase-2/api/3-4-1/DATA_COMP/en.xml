	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Methodology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Computation method:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 4 steps involved in the calculation of this indicator:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Estimation of WHO life tables, based on the UN World Population Prospects 2012 revision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Estimation of cause-of-death distributions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Calculation of age-specific mortality rates from the four main NCDs for each five-year age range between 30 and 70. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Calculation of the probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 years from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The methods used for the analysis of causes of death depend on the type of data available from countries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For countries with a high-quality vital registration system including information on cause of death, the vital registration that member states submit to the WHO Mortality Database were used, with adjustments where necessary, e.g. for under-reporting of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For countries without high-quality death registration data, cause of death estimates are calculated using other data, including household surveys with verbal autopsy, sample or sentinel registration systems, special studies and surveillance systems. In most cases, these data sources are combined in a modelling framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probability of dying between ages 30 and 70 years from the four main NCDs was estimated using age-specific death rates of the combined four main NCD categories. Using the life table method, the risk of death between the exact ages of 30 and 70, from any of the four causes and in the absence of other causes of death, was calculated using the equation below. The ICD codes used are: Cardiovascular disease: I00-I99, Cancer: C00-C97, Diabetes: E10-E14, and Chronic respiratory disease: J30-J98 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formulas to (1) calculate age-specific mortality rate for each five-year age group between 30 and 70, (2) translate the 5-year death rate into the probability of death in each 5-year age range, and (3) calculate the probability of death from age 30 to age 70, independent of other causes of death, can be found on page 6 of this document:&lt;/p&gt;
