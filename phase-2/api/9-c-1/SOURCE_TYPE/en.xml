&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator is based on an internationally agreed definition and methodology, which have been developed under the coordination of ITU, through its Expert Groups and following an extensive consultation process with countries. It is also a core indicator of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development&amp;apos;s Core List of Indicators, which has been endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission (last time in 2014).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ITU collects data for this indicator through an annual questionnaire from national regulatory authorities or Information and Communication Technology Ministries, who collect the data from Internet service providers.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
