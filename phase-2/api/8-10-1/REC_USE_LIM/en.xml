&lt;p&gt;Since 2009, the Financial Access Survey (FAS) collects information from administrative sources on an annual basis. The Central Bank or the main financial regulator reports yearly information including the two indicators that are part of the SDGs. Since its launch, 189 economies have contributed to the FAS, which now contains more than 100 series on financial inclusion covering the period 2004-2018.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
