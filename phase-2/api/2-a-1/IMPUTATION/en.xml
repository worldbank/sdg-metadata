	<message>The IMPUTATION field for indicator 2-a-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment of missing values:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;At country level:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The missing values of 2018 government expenditure in agriculture were imputed from the ones of 2017 data submitted from countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;At regional and global levels:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional and global aggregates of 2018 are based on mixed data of normal data from countries for which data are available and imputed data for countries for which data are not available. For the other period from 2001 to 2017, the regional and global aggregates are based on those of countries for which data are available. This may result in users interpreting these aggregates as pertaining to all countries in the region, which is the equivalent of treating countries with missing data as if they were the same as those for which data are available.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
