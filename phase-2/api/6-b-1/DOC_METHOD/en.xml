	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National governments participating in GLAAS fill out the country survey, preferably supported by a multi-stakeholder review. Although one ministry leads the process, it is often the case that many different ministries and departments must be involved in the process in order to obtain the data required to complete the questionnaire. A GLAAS national focal person supports the lead ministry to coordinate data collection, to compile the national response to the questionnaire, and to lead on the process of data validation. GLAAS survey documents for the current cycle can be found at the following link: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/monitoring/investments/glaas-2017-survey/en/&quot;&gt;http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/monitoring/investments/glaas-2017-survey/en/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) provides information on governance, monitoring, human resources, and financing in the water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sector. The UN-Water GLAAS survey is currently conducted on a biennial basis, led by WHO and has completed three full cycles (2009/2010, 2011/2012, and 2013/2014), as well as a pilot conducted in 2008. GLAAS survey documents for the current cycle of data collection (2016/2017) can be found at the following link: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/monitoring/investments/glaas-2017-survey/en/&quot;&gt;http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/monitoring/investments/glaas-2017-survey/en/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</data>
