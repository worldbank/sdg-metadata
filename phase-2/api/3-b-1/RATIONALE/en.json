{"status":"success","message":"The RATIONALE field for indicator 3-b-1, translated into en","data":"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n<p>This indicator aims to measure access to vaccines, including the newly available or underutilized vaccines, at the national level. In the past decades all countries added numerous new and underutilised vaccines in their national immunization schedule and there are several vaccines under final stage of development to be introduced by 2030. For monitoring diseases control and impact of vaccines it is important to measure coverage from each vaccine in national immunization schedule and the system is already in place for all national programmes, however direct measurement for proportion of population covered with all vaccines in the programme is only feasible if the country has a well-functioning national nominal immunization registry, usually an electronic one that will allow this coverage to be easily estimated. While countries will develop and strengthen immunization registries it is a need for an alternative measurement. </p>"}
