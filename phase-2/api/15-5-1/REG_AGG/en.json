{"status":"success","message":"The REG_AGG field for indicator 15-5-1, translated into en","data":"<h2>Regional aggregates:</h2>\n<p>The Red List Categories and Criteria are applied for each species on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and are determined globally and provided principally by the Specialist Groups and stand-alone Red List Authorities of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, IUCN Secretariat-led initiatives, the BirdLife International partnership, and the other IUCN Red List partner organizations. The staff of the IUCN Global Species Programme compile, validate, and curate these data, and are responsible for publishing and communicating the results. Each individual species assessment is supported by the application of metadata and documentation standards (IUCN 2013), including classifications of, for example, threats and conservation actions (Salafsky et al. 2008). </p>\n<p>Red List assessments are undertaken through either open workshops or through open-access web-based discussion fora. Assessments are reviewed by the appropriate Red List Authority (an individual or organization appointed by the IUCN Species Survival Commission to review assessments for specific species or groups of species) to ensure standardisation and consistency in the interpretation of information and application of the criteria. A Red List Technical Working Group and the IUCN Red List Unit work to ensure consistent categorization between species, groups and assessments. Finally, a Standards and Petitions Sub-committee monitors the process and resolves challenges and disputes over Red List assessments.</p>\n<p>In addition, IUCN publishes guidelines on applying the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria at regional or national scales (IUCN 2012b). Based on these, many countries have initiated programmes to assess the extinction risk of species occurring within their borders. These countries will be able to implement the Red List Index based on national extinction risk, once they have carried out at least two national Red Lists using the IUCN system in a consistent way (Bubb et al. 2009). An increasing number of countries have now completed national Red List Indices for a range of taxa (e.g., G&#xE4;rdenfors 2010, Pihl &amp; Flensted 2011).</p>\n<p>While global Red List Indices can be disaggregated to show trends for species at smaller spatial scales, the reverse is not true. National or regional Red List Indices cannot be aggregated to produce Red List Indices showing global trends. This is because a taxon&#x2019;s global extinction risk has to be evaluated at the global scale and cannot be directly determined from multiple national scale assessments across its range (although the data from such assessments can be aggregated for inclusion in the global assessment).</p>"}
