{"status":"success","message":"The DATA_COMP field for indicator 6-4-2, translated into en","data":"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n<p>Method of computation: The indicator is computed as the total freshwater withdrawn (TFWW) divided by the difference between the total renewable freshwater resources (TRWR) and the environmental flow requirements (EFR), multiplied by 100. All variables are expressed in km<sup>3</sup>/year (10<sup>9</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/year).</p>\n<p>Stress (%) = TFWW / (TRWR - EFR) * 100</p>\n<p>Following the experience of the initial five years of application of the indicator, and consistent with the approach taken during the MDG program, the threshold of 25% has been identified as the upper limit for a full and unconditional safety of water stress as assessed by the indicator 6.4.2.</p>\n<p>That means on one hand, that values below 25% can be considered safe in any instance (no stress); on the other, that values above 25% should be regarded as potentially and increasingly problematic, and should be qualified and/or reduced.</p>\n<p>Above 25% of water stress, four classes have been identified to signal different levels of stress severity:</p>\n<p>NO STRESS&#xA0;&lt;25%&#xA0;</p>\n<p>LOW 25% - 50%&#xA0;</p>\n<p>MEDIUM 50% - 75%&#xA0;</p>\n<p>HIGH 75-100%</p>\n<p>CRITICAL &gt;100%&#xA0;</p>"}
