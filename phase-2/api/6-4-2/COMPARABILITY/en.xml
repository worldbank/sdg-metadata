	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differences might occur due to the following, amongst others: For national estimates incoming freshwater is counted as being part of the country&amp;#x2019;s available freshwater resources, while global estimates can only be done by adding up the internal renewable water resources (water generated within the country) of all countries in order to avoid double counting. Moreover, external freshwater resources are computed according to treaties, if present, which may lead to different values with respect to the actual freshwater resources assessed through hydrology.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
