	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 8-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is widely available based on real observations provided by countries and derived from national labour force surveys, other types of household surveys or population census.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the disaggregation by disability is not widely available. It is increasingly reported but coverage is still very low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time series:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data for this indicator is available as of 2000 in the SDG Indicators Global Database, but time series going back further are available in ILOSTAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator should, ideally, be disaggregated by sex, age group and disability status.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
