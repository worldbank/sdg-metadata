{"status":"success","message":"The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 8-5-2, translated into en","data":"<h1>Data sources</h1>\n<h2>Description:</h2>\n<p>The preferred official national data source for this indicator is a household-based labour force survey. In the absence of a labour force survey, a population census and/or other type of household surveys with an appropriate employment module may also be used to obtain the required data. </p>\n<p>It is important to note that unemployment data derived from employment office records or unemployment registers would not refer to unemployment (as defined for the purposes of this indicator, using the three-criteria of being without a job, seeking employment and available for employment) but to registered unemployment, and thus, it would not be comparable with indicator 8.5.2.</p>"}
