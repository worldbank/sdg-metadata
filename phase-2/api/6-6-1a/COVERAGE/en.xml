	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 6-6-1a, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data for Sub-Indicators 1 and 2 is available annually. For Sub-Indicators 3, 4, and 5, data is already available from some countries and national authorities should strengthen their monitoring and report efforts to expand data availability for these three sub-indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data collection for all Sub-Indicators was included in a 2017 data drive to countries; however, the data is still being validated. In addition, national spatial extent data for 188 countries has been collected from 2001-2015 to support Sub-Indicator 1. Data for all 5 Sub-Indicators is reported to UNSD every 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time series:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reporting on this indicator will follow an annual cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicator 6.6.1 can be disaggregated by each Sub-Indicator. All Sub-Indicators can also be disaggregated at different spatial scales i.e.. National, basin, and ecosystem type.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
