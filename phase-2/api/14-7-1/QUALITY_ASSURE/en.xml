	<message>The QUALITY_ASSURE field for indicator 14-7-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Quality assurance:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to provide continuity of collection of data for value added for fisheries and aquaculture, and GDP across different versions of the Systems of National Accounts (SNA) and ISIC revisions, FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Department ensures its consistency by the use of backwards and forwards linkages when collecting and validating the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While SDG indicator 14.7.1 is completely constructed on data already provided by countries to FAO, to the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) and to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), countries are invited to collaborate with FAO to increase the precision of their results, by providing otherwise unavailable inputs for the calculation of the indicator.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
