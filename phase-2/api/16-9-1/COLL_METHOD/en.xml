	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Collection process:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNICEF undertakes a wide consultative process of compiling and assessing data from national sources for the purposes of updating its global databases on the situation of children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until 2017, the mechanism UNICEF used to collaborate with national authorities on ensuring data quality and international comparability on key indicators of relevance to children was known as Country Data Reporting on the Indicators for the Goals (CRING).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 2018, UNICEF undertakes an annual consultation with government authorities on 10 of the child-related SDG indicators in its role of sole or joint custodian, and in line with its global monitoring mandate and normative commitments to advancing the 2030 Agenda for children. This includes indicator 16.9.1. More details on the process for the country consultation are outlined below. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
