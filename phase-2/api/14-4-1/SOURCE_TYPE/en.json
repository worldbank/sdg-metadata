{"status":"success","message":"The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 14-4-1, translated into en","data":"<h1>Data sources</h1>\n<h2>Description:</h2>\n<p>The MSY-based reference point is often established through a formal stock assessment process. The data to inform stock assessments can come from many different sources, including fishery-dependent and fishery-independent sources. Fishery-dependent data are collected from the fishery itself, using both commercial and recreational sources through reporting or sample-based surveys at sea, at landing sites, or within fishing communities. Data from these sources are generally compiled into fisheries statistics. They can include information on removals of fish from the sea, which can include landings and discards, and information on the fleet such as number of boats, number of tows, time spent on the sea.</p>\n<p>Fisheries-independent are obtained in ways not related to any fishing activity and are typically collected by scientists via surveys (often scientific cruises) designed to sample species abundance and biomass over long time series, and over consistent seasons and geographic areas. Typically, fisheries-independent data collect biological information on the species (age, length, weight, maturity, etc.), and habitat and environmental information (temperature, salinity, depth, etc.).</p>\n<p>Three primary categories of data inputs are required for stock assessment, including data on life history traits, and time series of catch and fishing effort. <strong><em>Stock abundance</em></strong> is often not known and relative abundance or indices are often used to reflect historical changes in population size. These data can be sourced from fishery-independent surveys, e.g. acoustic or trawl-based sampling, or from fishery-dependent estimates using catch and effort data. Life history parameters provides information on individual growth and stock productivity e.g. fish size, age, reproductive rates, and natural mortality. <strong><em>Catch</em></strong> is the amount of fish removed from a stock by all types of fishing.</p>\n<p><strong>Global/Regional:</strong></p>\n<p>Because of the high data demands of classical stock assessment methods, only a limited number of fish stocks have been assessed. These species account for 17&#x2013;25 percent of the global catch (Branch et al., 2011), and most are caught by fisheries in developed countries. To balance the global representativeness of the assessment results and the goal of using the best available information, the FAO uses a wide spectrum of data and methods to extend its assessment to the fish stocks that account for the majority (70-80 percent) of the global catch (FAO, 2005).</p>\n<p><strong>National:</strong></p>\n<p>For country reporting, a questionnaire was sent out to all FAO member States with marine boundaries in 2019, and will be resent in 2020, 2021, and then on a two-year basis. For the complete list of questions used to inform this indicator, please refer to Appendix 2.</p>\n<h2>Collection process:</h2>\n<p><strong>Global/regional: </strong></p>\n<p>The fish stocks that FAO has monitored since 1974 represent a wide spectrum of data availability, ranging from data-rich and formally assessed stocks to those that have very little information apart from catch statistics by FAO major fishing area and those with no stock assessment at all. For the purposes of using the best available data and information and maintaining consistency among stocks and assessors, a procedure has been defined to identify stock status information (FAO 2011). </p>\n<p><strong>National: </strong></p>\n<p>FAO collects national data through a questionnaire sent to the Principal Focal Point (PFP) of each country. The PFP organises an institutional set-up which identifies the competent authorities to develop a reference list of stocks and completes the questionnaire. The information or data collected through the questionnaire from a country will initially only inform individual country progress. Depending on the evolution and further standardization of country reporting over the next 3-5 years, national data may be used to inform global/regional estimates.</p>"}
