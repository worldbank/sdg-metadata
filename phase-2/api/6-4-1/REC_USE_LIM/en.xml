	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 6-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Comments and limitations:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corrective coefficient Cr for the agricultural sector is needed in order to focus the indicator on the irrigated production. This is done for two main reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To ensure that only runoff water and groundwater (so-called blue water) are considered in computing the indicator;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To eliminate a potential bias of the indicators, which otherwise would tend to decrease if rainfed cropland is converted to irrigated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</data>
