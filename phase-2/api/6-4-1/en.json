Technical and economic institutions provide their relevant data, sometimes through the National Statistical Office (NSO), particularly for the economic data.</p>\n<p>Although data collection and its modality remains ultimately a responsibility of each country, FAO is working to promote a more regular involvement of NSOs, in order to ensure strongest consistency and robustness of the data provided.</p>\n<p>The list of National Focal Points for those countries involved through the GEMI project is in annex. </p><h1>Data compilers</h1>\n<p>FAO (through AQUASTAT), on behalf of UN-Water. The monitoring of this indicator will be integrated into the GEMI initiative, which together with JMP and GLAAS, under the UN-Water umbrella, will provide a coherent framework for global monitoring of SDG 6.</p><h2>Rationale:</h2>\n<p>The rationale behind this indicator consists in providing information on the efficiency of the economic and social usage of water resources, i.e. value added generated by the use of water in the main sectors of the economy, and distribution network losses.</p>\n<p>The distribution efficiency of water systems is implicit within the calculations and could be made explicit if needed and where data are available.</p>\n<p>This indicator addresses specifically the target component &#x201C;substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors&#x201D;, by measuring the output per unit of water from productive uses of water as well as losses in municipal water use. It does not aim at giving an exhaustive picture of the water utilization in a country. Other indicators, specifically those for Targets 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 5.4, 5.a, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5 will complement the information provided by this indicator. In particular, the indicator needs to be combined with the water stress indicator 6.4.2 to provide adequate follow-up of the target 6.4.</p>\n<p>Together, the three sectoral efficiencies provide a measure of overall water efficiency in a country. The indicator provides incentives to improve water use efficiency through all sectors, highlighting those sectors where water use efficiency is lagging behind.</p>\n<p>The interpretation of the indicator would be enhanced by the utilization of supplementary indicators to be used at country level. Particularly important in this sense would be the indicator on efficiency of water for energy and the indicator on the efficiency of the municipality distribution networks.</p><h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n<p>The corrective coefficient Cr for the agricultural sector is needed in order to focus the indicator on the irrigated production. This is done for two main reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>To ensure that only runoff water and groundwater (so-called blue water) are considered in computing the indicator;</li>\n  <li>To eliminate a potential bias of the indicators, which otherwise would tend to decrease if rainfed cropland is converted to irrigated.</li>\n</ul><h1>Methodology</h1>\n<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n<p>Water use efficiency is computed as the sum of the three sectors listed above, weighted according to the proportion of water used by each sector over the total use.

That is due to the fact that, for the agricultural sector, only the value produced under irrigation has to be counted in calculating the indicator. Hence, the sum of the value added of the various sectors used in these formulas is not equivalent to the total GDP of the country.</p><h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If scattered data (over time) are available, a methodology will be developed with regards to inter- and extrapolation.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>At regional and global levels:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If country data are missing, the value of the indicator will be considered in the average of the others in the same region.</p><h2>Regional aggregates:</h2>\n<p>The aggregation for global and regional estimations is done by summing up the values of the various parameters constituting the elements of the formula, i.e. value added by sector and water use by sector.

Also for this reason, coupling this indicator with water stress (6.4.2) is important for the interpretation of the data.</p>\n<h2>Obtaining internationally comparable data for global monitoring:</h2>\n<p>Data for this indicator are collected through a questionnaire/calculation sheet that allows countries to identify the needed parameters, and provide some preliminary control checks.</p>\n<p>The data so collected are then reviewed by FAO experts, also through the GEMI team if needed. The finding of the review is then shared with the country, in order to ensure consistency and harmonization of methods, definitions and results.</p>\n<p>FAO has prepared a Step-by-step methodological paper, in order to provide a technical guide for the country teams. Moreover, an e-learning tool, in the form of a course on-line, is being prepared and will be ready early in 2018. Finally, an overall manual is being drafted.</p><h1>References</h1>\n<ul>\n  <li>AQUASTAT main page: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/main/index.stm\">http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/main/index.stm</a></li>\n  <li>AQUASTAT glossary: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/glossary/search.html\">http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/glossary/search.html</a></li>\n  <li>AQUASTAT Main country database: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/query/index.html?lang=en\">http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/query/index.html?lang=en</a> </li>\n  <li>AQUASTAT Water use: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/water_use/index.stm\">http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/water_use/index.stm</a></li>\n  <li>AQUASTAT Water resources: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/water_res/index.stm\">http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/water_res/index.stm</a></li>\n  <li>AQUASTAT publications dealing with concepts, methodologies, definitions, terminologies, metadata, etc.: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/catalogues/index.stm\">http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/catalogues/index.stm</a></li>\n  <li>AQUASTAT Quality Control: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/index.stm#main\">http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/index.stm#main</a></li>\n  <li>AQUASTAT Guidelines: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/aq-5yr-guide_eng.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/aq-5yr-guide_eng.pdf</a></li>\n  <li>FAOSTAT production database: <a href=\"http://faostat3.fao.org/download/Q/*/E\">http://faostat3.fao.org/download/Q/*/E</a></li>\n  <li>UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics &#x2013; Water Section: <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/questionnaire.htm\">http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/questionnaire.htm</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/qindicators.htm\">http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/qindicators.htm</a><u> </u></li>\n  <li>Framework for the Development of Environment Statistics (FDES 2013) (Chapter 3): <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/FDES/FDES-2015-supporting-tools/FDES.pdf\">http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/FDES/FDES-2015-supporting-tools/FDES.pdf</a></li>\n  <li>International Recommendations for Water Statistics (IRWS) (2012): <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/irws/\">http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/irws/</a></li>\n  <li>OECD/Eurostat Questionnaire on Environment Statistics &#x2013; Water Section: <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/environment/water\">http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/environment/water</a></li>\n  <li>OECD National Accounts data files: <a href=\"http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/data/oecd-national-accounts-statistics_na-data-en\">http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/data/oecd-national-accounts-statistics_na-data-en</a></li>\n  <li>SEEA-Water: <a href=\"https://seea.un.org/sites/seea.un.org/files/seeawaterwebversion_final_en.pdf\">https://seea.un.org/sites/seea.un.org/files/seeawaterwebversion_final_en.pdf</a></li>\n  <li>SEEA Central Framework: <a href=\"https://seea.un.org/sites/seea.un.org/files/seea_cf_final_en.pdf\">https://seea.un.org/sites/seea.un.org/files/seea_cf_final_en.pdf</a> </li>\n  <li>UNSD National Accounts Main Aggregates Database: <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/selbasicFast.asp\">http://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/selbasicFast.asp</a></li>\n  <li>World Bank Databank (World Economic Indicators) <a href=\"http://databank.worldbank.org/data/home.aspx\">http://databank.worldbank.org/data/home.aspx</a></li>\n  <li>ISIC rev. 4: <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl=27\">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl=27</a></li>\n</ul>"}
