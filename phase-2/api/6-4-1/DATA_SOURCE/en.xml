	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data providers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data collection is done with different modalities in different countries. Technical and economic institutions provide their relevant data, sometimes through the National Statistical Office (NSO), particularly for the economic data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although data collection and its modality remains ultimately a responsibility of each country, FAO is working to promote a more regular involvement of NSOs, in order to ensure strongest consistency and robustness of the data provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of National Focal Points for those countries involved through the GEMI project is in annex. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
