	<message>The REG_AGG field for indicator 6-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Regional aggregates:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aggregation for global and regional estimations is done by summing up the values of the various parameters constituting the elements of the formula, i.e. value added by sector and water use by sector. The aggregated indicator is then calculated by applying the formula with those aggregated data, as if it were a single country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Excel sheet with the calculations is being prepared, and will be shared with the IAEG if required.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
