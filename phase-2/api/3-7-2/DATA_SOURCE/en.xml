&lt;p&gt;For civil registration data, data on births or the adolescent birth rate are obtained from country-reported data from the United Nations Statistics Division or regional Statistics Divisions or statistical units (ESCWA, ESCAP, CARICOM, SPC). The population figures are obtained from the last revision of the United Nations Population Division World Population Prospects and only exceptionally from other sources. Survey data are obtained from national household surveys that are internationally coordinated&amp;#x2014;such as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), the Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS), and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS)&amp;#x2014;and other nationally-sponsored surveys. Data from censuses are obtained from country-reported data from the United Nations Statistics Division or regional Statistics Divisions or statistical units (Eurostat, ESCWA, ESCAP, CARICOM, SPC) or directly from census reports.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
