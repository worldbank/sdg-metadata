{"status":"success","message":"The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 3-7-2, translated into en","data":"<h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>\n<p>Estimates based on civil registration are only provided when the country reports at least 90 per cent coverage and when there is reasonable agreement between civil registration estimates and survey estimates. Small discrepancies might arise due to different denominators or the inclusion of births to women under 15 years of age. Survey estimates are only provided when there is no reliable civil registration. There might be discrepancies on the dating and the actual figure if a different reference period is being used. In particular, many surveys report rates both for a three-year and a five-year reference period. For countries where data are scarce, reference periods of more than five years before the survey might be used.</p>"}
