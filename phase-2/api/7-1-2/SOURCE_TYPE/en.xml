&lt;p&gt;Primary household fuels and technologies, particularly for cooking, is routinely collected at the national levels in most countries using censuses and surveys. Household surveys used include: United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-supported Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS); United Nations Children&amp;#x2019;s Fund (UNICEF)-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS); WHO-supported World Health Surveys (WHS); and other reliable and nationally representative country surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization is the agency that has taken responsibility for compiling a database of statistics on access to clean and polluting fuels and technologies harvested from the full global body of household surveys for cooking, heating and lighting. Currently, the WHO Database covers cooking energy for 170 countries and one territory for the period 1960-2018 and is updated regularly and publicly available. For lighting, the WHO database includes data for 77 countries for the period 1963=-2018. For heating, the WHO database includes data for 55 countries for the period 1977 &amp;#x2013; 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently WHO is working with national surveying agencies, country statistical offices and other stakeholders (e.g. researchers) to enhance multipurpose household survey instruments to gather data on the fuels and technologies used for heating and lighting.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
