&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Solar energy consumption includes solar PV and solar thermal. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Liquid biofuel energy consumption includes biogasoline, biodiesels and other liquid biofuels. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Solid biofuel consumption includes fuelwood, animal waste, vegetable waste, black liquor, bagasse and charcoal. &lt;/li&gt;
