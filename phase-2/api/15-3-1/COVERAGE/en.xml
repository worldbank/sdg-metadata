&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many countries, national data for one or more of the sub-indicators are available. Regional and global data are available for all three sub-indicators and can be disaggregated at the national level for interpretation and validation by national authorities. Communication and coordination with national statistical systems, NSO representatives and UNCCD national focal points in a transparent manner will include an assessment of data needs and capacity building for monitoring and reporting on the indicator when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time series:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual since the year 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator can be disaggregated by land cover class or other spatially explicit land unit.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
