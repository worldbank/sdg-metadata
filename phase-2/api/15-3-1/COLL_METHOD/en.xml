	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 15-3-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Collection process:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on the indicator and sub-indicators will be provided by national authorities (&amp;#x201C;main reporting entity&amp;#x201D;) to the UNCCD in their national reports following a standard format every four years beginning in 2018 or through other national data platforms and mechanisms endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission. This will include the original data and reference sources, and descriptions of how these have been used to derive the indicator and sub-indicators. Eligible (i.e. developing) countries will receive financial and technical assistance in preparing their national reports from the UNCCD and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once received, national reports will undergo a review process by the UNCCD and its partners to ensure the correct use of definitions and methodology as well as internal consistency. A comparison can be made with past assessments and other existing data sources. Regular contacts between the main reporting entity and UNCCD secretariat via a help desk system, and through regional, sub-regional, and national workshops, will form part of this review process, enable data adjustments when needed, and contribute to building national capacities. The data will then be aggregated at sub-regional, regional and global levels by the UNCCD and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
