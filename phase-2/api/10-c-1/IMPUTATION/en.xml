	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Treatment of missing values:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At country level:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sample of corridors is collected for each sending and receiving country. It is assumed that the cost of other corridors from/to each country fall in similar cost range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At regional and global levels:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional aggregates are computed by calculating simple averages of individual services remitting to the recipient countries in the region for which there is data. Countries with no data are not included, however, as a representative sample is built, it is assumed that missing data fall in the same cost range as collected data. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
