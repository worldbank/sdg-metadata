The beneficiary students and trainees are nationals of developing countries. Financial aid awards include bilateral grants to students registered for systematic instruction in private or public institutions of higher education to follow full-time studies or training courses in the donor country. Estimated tuition costs of students attending schools financed by the donor but not receiving individual grants are not included here, but under item imputed student costs (CRS sector code 1520). Training costs relate to contributions for trainees from developing countries receiving mainly non-academic, practical or vocational training in the donor country.</p><h1>Data sources</h1>\n<h2>Description:</h2>\n<p>The OECD/DAC has been collecting data on official and private resource flows from 1960 at an aggregate level and 1973 at an activity level through the Creditor Reporting System (CRS data are considered complete from 1995 for commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements). </p>\n<p>Data for scholarships are only available since 2010 when the new typology of aid was introduced in DAC statistics.</p>\n<p>The data are reported by donors according to the same standards and methodologies (see here: <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm\">http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm</a>). </p>\n<p>Data are reported on an annual calendar year basis by statistical reporters in national administrations (aid agencies, Ministries of Foreign Affairs or Finance, etc.</p><h2>Collection process:</h2>\n<p>A statistical reporter is responsible for the collection of DAC statistics in each providing country/agency.
