	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 6-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Collection process:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data are not so far included in the National Statistical Systems but the information needed to calculate the indicator is simple, does not require advanced monitoring capacities and is normally available to all countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spatial information (&amp;#x201C;transboundary basin area&amp;#x201D;) is normally available in ministries in charge of water resources. Regarding operationality of arrangement the data needed for calculating the indicator can be directly obtained from information from administrative records (Member States have records of cooperation arrangements). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limitations in terms of comparability of the results between countries are the same as the ones described in Section 12. However, a clear definition and consideration of the criteria as developed in the detailed methodology currently tested under the UN-Water GEMI initiative and that will be available to countries ensure a common reference for the countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the elements of the indicator are based on the main principles of customary international water law, also contained in the two UN conventions - Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses (New York, 1997) and the UNECE Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Helsinki, 1992) &amp;#x2013; as well as the draft Articles on The Law of Transboundary Aquifers (2008; UN General Assembly resolutions 63/124 and 66/104).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed mechanism of reporting under the water Convention will allow also having sub-components of the indicator reported by countries, which will ensure both more confidence on the final indicator value (validation) and increased comparability.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
