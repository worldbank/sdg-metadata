	<message>The REG_AGG field for indicator 6-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Regional aggregates:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional and global estimates will be obtained by summing up the total transboundary basin areas with arrangement and dividing the result by the total transboundary basin area of the countries. It means that the total transboundary basin area need to be reported at national level, in addition to the indicator value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information collected with the reporting under the Water Convention can support disaggregation at basin level and distinguishing aquifers and river basins, and support aggregation at the global or regional level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baseline assessment from global database can be performed at any desired geographical scale: sub-national, national, regional, basin scale, global, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
