	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Rationale:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial development generally entails a structural transition from resource-based and low technology activities to MHT activities. A modern, highly complex production structure offers better opportunities for skills development and technological innovation. MHT activities are also the high value addition industries of manufacturing with higher technological intensity and labour productivity. Increasing the share of MHT sectors also reflects the impact of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
