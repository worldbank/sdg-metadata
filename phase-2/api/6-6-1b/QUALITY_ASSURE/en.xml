	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Quality assurance:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once received, the country reports undergo a rigorous review process to ensure correct use of definitions and methodology as well as internal consistency. A comparison is made with past information and other existing data sources. Regular contacts between national correspondents and Ramsar Staff by e-mail and webinars/regional/sub-regional review workshops form part of this review process in order to support country capacities in particular for monitoring purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missing reports prepared by the Ramsar Secretariat for Indictor 6.6.1 are sent to the respective Ramsar Administrative Authority for validation before finalization and publishing of data. The data are then aggregated at sub-regional, regional and global levels by the Ramsar Secretariat team. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
