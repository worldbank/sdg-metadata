	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data are available for all countries (143) that submitted National Reports for COP13 as well as for previous COPs as indicated below. The data collected include information on wetland inventories and extent. For the missing country data (16%) as indicated in the &amp;#x201C;Quality assurance section&amp;#x201D; the Secretariat will prepare in 2018 reports with the available source of information for Indictor 6.6.1 that will be sent to the respective Ramsar Administrative Authorities for validation. The gaps of information will be addressed during 2018 and 2019 to fully report in late 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time series:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secretariat holds National Report information from COP8 (2002), COP9 (2005), COP10 (2008), COP11 (2012), COP12 (2015) and COP13 (2018) National Reports, in databases which permit an analysis of trends in implementation over time, from the 2002-2005 triennium to 2012-2015 that includes specific indicators such as wetland inventories. However, for wetland extent the data collection has started in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/h2&gt;
