&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands Secretariat has been collecting and analysing data on country implementation since 2000 including information about wetland inventories. This is done at intervals of 3 years that is the cycle of Country reporting under the Convention &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1999 review of the state of wetland inventory worldwide (&lt;em&gt;Global review of wetland resources and priorities for wetland inventory &lt;/em&gt;- GRoWI), which was undertaken for the Ramsar Convention, identified not only the major gaps in the extent to which wetland inventory had been undertaken, but also found that for the inventories which had been made it was frequently very hard to trace their existence, to identify their purpose, scope and coverage, and/or to access the information contained in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another source of information is the update of the Wetland Extent Trends (WET) Index that was commissioned by the Ramsar Convention Secretariat to WCMC. The Wet Index is an updatable indicator of wetland area trends where there are still gaps of information. However, is not applicable at national level and has been used, as data are not available at national level. This will be fixed with national reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the format for National Report for COP13 the Contracting Parties agreed the inclusion of an indicator on the extent of wetlands and change in the extent (indicator 6.6.1). For COP13, 44% of Contracting Parties have completed national wetlands inventories and 16% of Parties reported that their wetland inventories are in progress. Therefore, all data are provided to the Ramsar Secretariat by countries in the form of a country report following a standard format, which includes the original data and reference sources and descriptions of how these have been used to estimate the extent of wetlands. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
