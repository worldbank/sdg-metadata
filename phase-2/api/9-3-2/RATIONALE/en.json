{"status":"success","message":"The RATIONALE field for indicator 9-3-2, translated into en","data":"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n<p>Industrial enterprises are classified to small compared to large or medium for their distinct nature of economic organization, production capability, scale of investment and other economic characteristics. &#x201C;Small-scale industries&#x201D; can be run with a small amount of capital, relatively unskilled labor and using local materials. Despite their small contribution to total industrial output, their role in job creation, especially in developing countries is recognized to be significant where the scope of absorbing surplus labor force from traditional sectors such as agriculture or fishery is very high. &#x201C;Small-scale industries&#x201D; are capable of meeting domestic demand of basic consumer goods such as food, clothes, furniture, etc. </p>\n<p>Thus &#x201C;small-scale industries&#x201D; play an important role in the economy. However, it has quite limited access to financial services, especially in developing countries. In order to improve the skill of workers and technology for production, small-scale industrial enterprises require financial support in the form of preferential loan, credit etc. This indicator shows how widely financial institutions are serving the &#x201C;small-scale industries&#x201D;. Together with the indicator SDG 9.3.1, this indicator reflects the main message of the target 9.3 which promotes to increase the access of &#x201C;small-scale industries&#x201D; to financial services.</p>"}
