	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Collection process:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If data sources have any information on electricity access, it is collected and analysed in line with the previous trends and future projections of each country. Data validation is conducted by checking that the figures are reflective of the ground level scenario as well as are in line with country populations, income levels and electrification programs. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
