	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is currently collected for 140 countries from 1990 to 2018, excluding &amp;#x201C;High Income&amp;#x201D; or &amp;#x201C;Developed&amp;#x201D; countries as classified by the United Nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time series:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data for countries have been compiled for the 1990-2018 period, though there are gaps in accurate data availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electricity access rates are disaggregated by geographic location into total, urban and rural rates. Countries that are classified as &amp;#x201C;Developed&amp;#x201D; or &amp;#x201C;High Income&amp;#x201D; are assumed to have 100 percent from the first year it was added to the category. Disaggregation of access to electricity by rural or urban place of residence is possible for all countries.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
