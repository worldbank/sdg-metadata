The country teams are comprised of primarily epidemiologists, demographers, monitoring and evaluation specialists and technical partners.</p>\n<p>The software used to produce the estimates is Spectrum&#x2014;developed by Avenir Health (www.avenirhealth.org)&#x2014;and the Estimates and Projections Package, which is developed by the East-West Center (<a href=\"www.eastwestcenter.org\">www.eastwestcenter.org</a>). The UNAIDS Reference Group on Estimates, Modelling and Projections provides technical guidance on the development of the HIV component of the software (<a href=\"www.epidem.org\">www.epidem.org</a>).</p><h1>Calendar</h1>\n<h2>Data collection:</h2>\n<p>Data sources are compiled all year long. The spectrum models are created in the first three months of every year and finalized by June. The next report will be in July 2020. </p><h2>Data release:</h2>\n<p>June 2018, June 2019, etc. </p><h1>Data providers</h1>\n<p>The estimates are produced by a team consisting of ministry of health, national AIDS advisory groups and development partners. The results are signed off on by senior managers at the ministries of health.</p><h1>Data compilers</h1>\n<p>UNAIDS</p><h2>Rationale:</h2>\n<p>The incidence rate provides a measure of progress toward preventing onward transmission of HIV.</p><h1>Methodology</h1>\n<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n<p>Longitudinal data on individuals are the best source of data but are rarely available for large populations. Special diagnostic tests in surveys or from health facilities can be used to obtain data on HIV incidence. HIV incidence is thus modelled using the Spectrum software.</p><h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Estimates are not collected from countries with populations &lt; 250,000. In addition no estimates are available for 10 countries with very small HIV epidemics who do not produce estimates. For some countries the estimates were not finalized at the time of publication. The country specific values are not presented for these countries.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>At regional and global levels:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The countries with populations &lt; 250,000 and the 10 countries that do not produce estimates are not included in regional or global level estimates. For countries in which the estimates were not finalized at the time of publication, the unofficial best estimates are included in the regional and global values.</p><h2>Regional aggregates:</h2>\n<p>Available for the World, the SDG regional groupings, LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS.</p><h2>Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level:</h2>\n<p>A description of the methodology is available at: </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/Estimates_methods_2018.pdf\">http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/Estimates_methods_2018.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Countries are providing with capacity building workshops every two years on the methods. In addition, they are supported by in country specialists in roughly 45 countries. Where no in country specialists are available remote assistance is provided.
