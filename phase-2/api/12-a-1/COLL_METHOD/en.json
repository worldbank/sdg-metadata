{"status":"success","message":"The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 12-a-1, translated into en","data":"<h2>Collection process:</h2>\n<p>The capacity data is collected as part of IRENA&#x2019;s annual questionnaire cycle. Questionnaires are sent to countries at the start of a year asking for renewable energy data for two years previously (i.e. at the start of 2019, questionnaires ask for data for the year 2017). The data is then validated and checked with countries and published in the IRENA Renewable Energy Statistics Yearbook at the end of June. To minimise reporting burden, the questionnaires for some countries are pre-filled with data collected by other agencies (e.g. Eurostat) and are sent to countries for them to complete any additional details requested by IRENA.</p>\n<p>At the same time as this, preliminary estimates of capacity for the previous year are also collected from official sources where available (e.g. national statistics, data from electricity grid operators) and from other unofficial sources (mostly industry associations for the different renewable energy sectors). These are published at the end of March. </p>\n<h2>Population data:</h2>\n<p>For the population part of this indicator, IRENA population data from the United Nations World Population Prospects. The population data reflects the residents in a country or area regardless of legal status or citizenship. The values are midyear estimates.</p>\n<p>The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs published information about their methodology on the link below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://population.un.org/wpp/Methodology/\">https://population.un.org/wpp/Methodology/</a></p>"}
