&lt;p&gt;The ITF and UNECE conduct annual checks of their jointly collected data, comparing the data for internal consistency, against previous years, and on a per capita basis across countries, to determine if the data appear reasonable. Significant correspondence is undertaken with the countries over potential errors, and common issues and challenges are discussed at both the ITF annual statistics meeting and the UNECE&amp;#x2019;s annual Working Party on Transport Statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common problem for many countries is that passenger-km are only collected for public transport. Given that private passenger cars form the majority of passenger trips in most countries, this would clearly significantly underestimate road passenger-km, which is why the breakdown where available between passenger cars, buses and motorcycles is given. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
