	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Regional and global estimates for global monitoring:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional and global estimates will be derived from national figures with an appropriate disaggregation level. Specialized tools will be developed and agreed upon with local and international stakeholders. Systems of quality assurance on the use of the tools, analysis and reporting will be deployed regionally, and global to ensure that standards are uniform and that definitions are universally applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect that investments in improved data collection and monitoring at country level will produce incentives for governments to improve reporting and performance and also greater readiness to engage with multiple stakeholders in data collection and analysis and in achieving better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of existing slum definitions and their applications. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
