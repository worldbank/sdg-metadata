&lt;p&gt;Total resource flows for development, by recipient and donor countries and type of flow comprises of Official Development Assistance (ODA), other official flows (OOF) and private flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official and private flows, both concessional and non-concessional to developing countries. For official flows the major distinction is between official development assistance (ODA) and other official flows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OOF, while private flows are broken down into flows at market terms and charitable grants. Flows include contributions to multilateral development agencies, which are themselves official bodies.
