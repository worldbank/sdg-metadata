The CCI product consists of a series of annual Land Cover maps at 300 m resolution spanning the period 1992 to 2018. The period from 1992-2015 is available in raster format, whereas the 2016-2018 is available in netCDF format and a transformation to GTIFF is required to make these datasets available for processing in a GIS environment. The land cover data is updated every year by the European Space Agency. </p>\n<p>The ESA CCI adheres to the Cover Classification System of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UN FAO) (Santoro, et al., 2015). </p>\n<p><strong>2) Kapos mountain class layer:</strong></p>\n<p>The Kapos dataset is a global mountain descriptor raster file. The file provides a classification of mountain ranges in accordance with the definitions proposed by Kapos et al 2000 :</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Class 1: elevation &gt; 4500 meters </li>\n  <li>Class 2: elevation 3500 - 4500 meters</li>\n  <li>Class 3: elevation 2500 &#x2013; 3500 meters </li>\n  <li>Class 4: elevation 1500 &#x2013; 2500 meters and slope &#x2265; 2</li>\n  <li>Class 5: elevation 1,000&#x2013;1,500 meters and slope &#x2265; 5 or local elevation range (7 kilometers radius) &#x2265; 300 meters</li>\n  <li>Class 6: elevation 300&#x2013;1,000 meters and local elevation range (7 kilometres radius) &#x2265; 300 meters outside 23&#xB0;N&#x2014;19&#xB0;S </li>\n  <li>Class 0: Defined to represent the non-mountainous areas. </li>\n</ul>"}
