	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data are available for over 170 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lag between the reference year and actual production of data series depends on the availability of the household survey for each country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time series:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1990-2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this indicator, when data are reported from household surveys, disaggregation is available for various socio-economic characteristics including residence (urban/rural), household wealth (quintiles), education level of the mother, maternal age, geographic regions. When data are reported from administrative sources, disaggregation is more limited and tend to include only residence. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
