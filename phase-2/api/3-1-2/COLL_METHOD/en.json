{"status":"success","message":"The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 3-1-2, translated into en","data":"<h2>Collection process:</h2>\n<p>UNICEF and WHO maintain joint databases on skilled attendance at delivery (e.g. doctor, nurse or midwife or any additional qualified category) and both collaborate to ensure the consistency of data sources. These surveys include Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS) and national surveys based on similar methodologies. The surveys are undertaken every 3 to 5 years. For mainly industrialized countries (where the coverage is high), data sources include routine service statistics.</p>\n<p>Before acceptance into the joint global databases, UNICEF and WHO undergo a country consultation that consists of an updating and verification process that includes correspondence with field offices to clarify any questions regarding estimates. During this process, the national categories of skilled health personnel are verified, and so the estimates for some countries may include additional categories of trained personnel beyond doctors, nurses, and midwives.</p>"}
