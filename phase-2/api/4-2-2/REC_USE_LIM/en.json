{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 4-2-2, translated into en","data":"<h2><strong><strong>Comments and limitations:</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>Participation in learning programmes in the early years is not full time for many children, meaning that exposure to learning environments outside of the home will vary in intensity. The indicator measures the percentage of children who are exposed to organized learning but not the intensity of the programme, which limits the ability to draw conclusions on the extent to which this target is being achieved. More work is needed to ensure that the definition of learning programmes is consistent across various surveys and defined in a manner that is easily understood by survey respondents, ideally with complementary information collected on the amount of time children spend in learning programmes.</p>"}
