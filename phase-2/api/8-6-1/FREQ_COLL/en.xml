&lt;h2&gt;Data collection:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ILO sends out its annual ILOSTAT questionnaire on labour statistics, usually in the 2nd quarter, with a view to receiving the requested statistics by the 3rd quarter or the end of the year at the latest. Data received in batch from regional and national statistical offices and data obtained through the processing of microdata sets of national household surveys by the ILO Department of Statistics are continuously updated in ILOSTAT (as they become available to the ILO Department of Statistics).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
