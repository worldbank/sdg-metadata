&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 150 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time series:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At country level, data are provided for the years where surveys are included in the joint dataset. Survey years range from 1983 to 2016. For the global and regional levels, estimates are provided only for the latest available estimate upon release each year (i.e. in Sept 2016 edition of the Joint Malnutrition Estimates the only estimate available for was for 2015 and no time series were provided). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/h2&gt;

Disaggregated country data are available in a majority of household surveys and UNICEF-WHO-The World Bank Group are expanding the joint data set to include sub national and stratified estimates (e.g. sex, age groups, wealth, mothers&amp;apos; education, residence) in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
