This draws on definitions available for many other SDG indicators. For example, elements of basic services are measured under indicators 3.7.1 (health), 4.1.1 (education), 6.1.1 (water), 6.2.1 (sanitation), 7.1.1 (energy), 11.2.1 (public transport), etc. </p>\n<p>Finally, many countries still have limited capacities for data management, data collection and monitoring, and continue to struggle with limited data on large or densely populated geographical areas. This means that complementarity in data reporting in a few exceptions is needed to ensure that both national and global figures achieve consistencies in the final reported data for access to basic services.</p>"}
