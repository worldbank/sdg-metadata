	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Regional aggregates:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weighted averages are the preferred method for calculating regional and global average rates. For this purpose, regional averages of the proportion of unsentenced detainees are obtained by adding up the number of unsentenced persons held in the region and dividing the total by the sum of the total number of persons held in detention in the region. Similarly, global averages of the proportion of unsentenced detainees are obtained by adding up the number of unsentenced persons held globally and dividing the total by the sum of the total number of persons held in detention globally.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
