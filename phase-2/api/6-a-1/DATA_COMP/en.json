{"status":"success","message":"The DATA_COMP field for indicator 6-a-1, translated into en","data":"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n<p>The indicator is computed as the proportion of total water and sanitation-related ODA that is included in the government budget, i.e. the amount of water and sanitation-related ODA in the government budget divided by the total amount of water and sanitation-related ODA.</p>\n<p>The numerator on water and sanitation-related ODA in the government budget will be obtained from the UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) survey for the 2016-2017 cycle. The question on external funding collects data on the amount of donor funds that were included in government budget. Data for 2015 ODA disbursements through GLAAS will be available by end-2016. The scope of the question on external funding has been expanded beyond WASH for the 2016-17 cycle to address all targets under SDG 6, including wastewater and water quality, water efficiency, water resource management, and water-related ecosystems.</p>\n<p>The denominator on total water and sanitation-related ODA disbursements will be obtained through OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS) (purpose codes 14000-series for the water sector and purpose code 31140 for agricultural water resources). Data on ODA disbursements for 2015 will be made available through CRS in December 2016.</p>"}
