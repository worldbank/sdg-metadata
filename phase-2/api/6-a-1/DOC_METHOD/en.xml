	<message>The DOC_METHOD field for indicator 6-a-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questionnaires for providers of development cooperation are available at the following link: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/&quot;&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/&lt;/a&gt; The data included in the indicator are ODA flows from all donors to developing countries eligible for ODA for the water sector (water and sanitation (purpose codes 14000- series), agricultural water resources (purpose code 31140), flood prevention/control (purpose code 41050), and hydroelectric power plants (purpose code 23220)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) has been collecting data on aid flows since 1973 through the OECD Creditor Reporting System based on a standard methodology and agreed definitions from member countries and other aid providers. The data are generally obtained on an activity level, and include numerous parameters to allow disaggregation by provider and recipient country, by type of finance, and by type of resources provided. Data are available for essentially all high-income countries as bilateral donors, and for an increasing number of middle-income aid providers, as well as multi-lateral lending institutions. Methodology on ODA data collection by OECD can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
