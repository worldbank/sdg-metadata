{"status":"success","message":"The RATIONALE field for indicator 6-a-1, translated into en","data":"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n<p>The amount of water and sanitation-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) is a quantifiable measurement as a proxy for &#x201C;international cooperation and capacity development support&#x201D; in financial terms. It is essential to be able to assess ODA in proportion with how much of it is included in the government budget to gain a better understanding of whether donors are aligned with national governments while highlighting total water and sanitation ODA disbursements to developing countries over time. </p>\n<p>A low value of this indicator (near 0%) would suggest that international donors are investing in water and sanitation related activities and programmes in the country outside the purview of the national government. A high value (near 100%) would indicate that donors are aligned with national government and national policies and plans for water and sanitation.</p>"}
