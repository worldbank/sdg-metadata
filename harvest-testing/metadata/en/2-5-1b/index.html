Definition and concepts</p><p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
<p>The conservation of plant and animal genetic resources for food and agriculture (GRFA) in medium or long term conservation facilities (<em>ex situ</em>, in genebanks) represents the most trusted means of conserving genetic resources worldwide. Plant and animal GRFA conserved in these facilities can be easily used in breeding programmes as well, even directly on-farm.</p>
<p>The measure of trends in <em>ex situ</em> conserved materials provides an overall assessment of the extent to which we are managing to maintain and/or increase the total genetic diversity available for future use and thus protected from any permanent loss of genetic diversity which may occur in the natural habitat, i.e. <em>in situ</em>, or on-farm.</p>
<p>The two components of the indicator, plant and animal GRFA, are separately counted.</p>
<p><em>Plant genetic resources</em> </p>
<p>The plant component is calculated as the number of accessions of plant genetic resources secured in conservation facilities under medium or long term conditions, where an &#x2018;accession&#x2019; is defined as a distinct sample of seeds, planting materials or plants which is maintained in a genebank. Genebank Standards for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (accessible at <a href="http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/7b79ee93-0f3c-5f58-9adc-5d4ef063f9c7/">http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/7b79ee93-0f3c-5f58-9adc-5d4ef063f9c7/</a>), set the benchmark for current scientific and technical best practices for conserving plant genetic resources, and support key international policy instruments for the conservation and use of plant genetic resources. These voluntary standards have been endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at its Fourteenth Regular Session (<a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/028/mg538e.pdf">http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/028/mg538e.pdf</a>). </p>
<p><em>Animal genetic resources</em> </p>
<p>The animal component is calculated as the number of local breeds (i.e. being reported to exist only in one country) stored within a genebank collection with an amount of genetic material stored which is required to reconstitute the breed in case of extinction (further information on &#x201C;sufficient material stored to reconstitute a breed&#x201D; can be found in the Guidelines on Cryconservation of Animal Genetic Resources, FAO, 2012, accessible at http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm). The guidelines have been endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at its Thirteenth Regular Session (http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/024/mc192e.pdf).</p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p><em>Plant genetic resources</em></p>
<p>Plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (PGRFA): Any genetic material of plant origin of actual or potential value for food and agriculture.</p>
<p>Accession: An accession is defined as a sample of seeds, planting materials or plants representing either a wild population, a landrace, a breeding line or an improved cultivar, which is conserved in a genebank. Each accession should be distinct and, in terms of genetic integrity, as close as possible to the sample provided originally.</p>
<p>Base collection: A base collection is defined as a set of unique accessions to be preserved for a medium to long-term period.</p>
<p>Active collection: An active collection is defined as a set of distinct accessions that is used for regeneration, multiplication, distribution, characterization and evaluation. Active collections are maintained in short to medium-term storage and usually duplicated in a base collection. </p>
<p>Medium or long term conservation facilities: Biological diversity is often conserved <em>ex situ</em>, outside its natural habitat, in facilities called genebanks. In the case of plant genetic resources, genebanks conserve base collections under medium or long term storage conditions, in the form of seeds in cold rooms, plants in the field and tissues <em>in vitro</em> and/or cryoconserved. </p>
<p><em>Animal genetic resources</em></p>
<p>Breed: A breed is either a sub-specific group of domestic livestock with definable and identifiable external characteristics that enable it to be separated by visual appraisal from other similarly defined groups within the same species, or a group for which geographical and/or cultural separation from phenotypically similar groups has led to acceptance of its separate identity. </p>
<p>Medium or long term conservation facilities: Biological diversity is often conserved <em>ex situ</em>, outside its natural habitat, in facilities called genebanks. In the case of domestic animal diversity, <em>ex situ</em> conservation includes both the maintenance of live animals (<em>in vivo</em>) and cryoconservation. </p>
<p>Cryoconservation is the collection and deep-freezing of semen, ova, embryos or tissues for potential future use in breeding or regenerating animals.</p></div><a name="SOURCE_TYPE"></a><div id="SOURCE_TYPE"><p class="concept-name">3.a. Data sources</p><p><em>Plant genetic resources</em></p>
<p>Data are sourced from officially appointed National Focal Points (NFP) (see <a href="http://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/thematic-sitemap/theme/seeds-pgr/gpa/national-focal-points/en/">http://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/thematic-sitemap/theme/seeds-pgr/gpa/national-focal-points/en/</a>) and regional and international agricultural research centres holding PGRFA <em>ex situ</em> collections. Data providers report either (i) directly to FAO by using the spreadsheet contained in document List of descriptors for reporting on the Plant Component of SDG indicator 2.5.1 (see References) accessible from the WIEWS home page (<a href="http://www.fao.org/wiews">http://www.fao.org/wiews</a>) or (ii) through published information systems which comply with the standard of the FAO/Bioversity Multi-crop Passport Descriptor List (MCPD) v. 2 (see References), e.g. EURISCO (<a href="http://eurisco.ipk-gatersleben.de/">http://eurisco.ipk-gatersleben.de/</a>) and Genesys (<a href="https://www.genesys-pgr.org">https://www.genesys-pgr.org</a>). </p>
<p>Data are stored in the World Information and Early Warning System for plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (WIEWS - <a href="http://www.fao.org/wiews">http://www.fao.org/wiews</a>), the FAO platform established to facilitate information exchange as well as periodic assessments of the state of the world&#x2019;s plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. </p>
<p><em>Animal genetic resources</em></p>
<p>National Coordinators for Management of Animal Genetic Resources, nominated by their respective government, provide data to the Domestic Animal Diversity Information System (DAD-IS) (http://dad.fao.org/). DAD-IS allows countries the storage of data on animal genetic resources being secured in either medium or long term conservation facilities as needed for the indicator.</p></div><a name="COLL_METHOD"></a><div id="COLL_METHOD"><p class="concept-name">3.b.

Data compilers</p><p>Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (UN FAO)</p></div><a name="RATIONALE"></a><div id="RATIONALE"><p class="concept-name">4.a. Rationale</p><p>Genetic resources for food and agriculture provide the building blocks of food security and, directly or indirectly, support the livelihoods of every person on earth. As the conservation and accessibility to these resources are of vital importance, medium- or long- term conservation facilities (genebanks) to preserve and make these resources and their associated information accessible for breeding and research have been established at country, regional and global levels. Inventories of genebank holdings provide a dynamic measure of the existing plant and animal diversity and its level of preservation. Data relevant to this indicator facilitate the monitoring of diversity secured and accessible through genebanks and support the development and updating of strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources.</p>
<p>The indicator is related to a monitoring framework endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture in which the status and trends of plant and animal genetic resources are described through globally agreed indicators and regular country-driven assessments. </p>
<p>The number of materials conserved under medium- or long-term storage conditions provides an indirect measurement of the total genetic diversity, which are managed to secure for future use. Overall, positive variations are therefore approximated to an increase in the agro-biodiversity secured, while negative variations to a loss of it. </p>
<p>Caution needs to be paid in the reporting and interpretation of the indicator. In the case of plant genetic resources, an uncontrolled addition of accessions that are in fact duplicates of samples already conserved and accounted for, or, <em>vice versa</em>, the deletion from the reported collections of redundant duplicates may lead to wrong interpretations. In order to avoid duplicate counting at the national level, primarily base collections should be reported. An active collection could be reported, only when, in the absence of a base collection, it also serves the function of the base collection.Another example that needs to be monitored both while reporting and interpreting the results include the grouping or splitting of accessions, as in both cases the variation in the accounted number does not reflect a variation in the genetic diversity conserved and secured. Therefore, it is crucial that reporting countries and regional/international centres together with the accession level information requested explain also the reason for the decrease or increase in the number of accessions, in particular when this does not reflect a real loss or gain in the genetic diversity conserved and secured.</p></div><a name="REC_USE_LIM"></a><div id="REC_USE_LIM"><p class="concept-name">4.b. Comment and limitations</p><p><em>Plant genetic resources</em></p>
<p>Broadly, two issues are of concern in using the &#x201C;number of accessions&#x201D; as an indicator of diversity in <em>ex situ</em> collections:</p>
<p>Undetected duplicates of accessions may contribute to an increase of the indicator, as each accession is a managed unit, kept and recorded as distinct. The detection of such duplicates will therefore result in a reduction in the number of accession previously reported. This can occur at different levels, for example within genebank collections and also at international level.</p>
<p>A loss of viability of the material(s) conserved that is not promptly detected may similarly not be reflected in the number of accessions, contributing to an overestimate of the actual number of accessions.</p>
<p>Additional information could be provided by other indicators measuring <em>ex situ</em> conservation, which are part of the monitoring of the implementation of the Global Plan of Action for PGRFA under the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. </p>
<p><em>Animal genetic resources</em></p>
<p>Information on cryoconserved material in the Domestic Animal Diversity Information System DAD-IS needs to be updated on a regular base.</p></div><a name="DATA_COMP"></a><div id="DATA_COMP"><p class="concept-name">4.c. Method of computation</p><p><em>Plant genetic resources</em></p>
<p>The plant component of the indicator is calculated as the total number of unique accessions of plant genetic resources secured in medium to long term conservation facilities. This should include all the accessions in base collections, and unique accessions stored in medium term conservation facilities, as active collections, only when these accessions are considered to become part of the national base collections. Base collections may include both seed, field, cryo-preserved or <em>in vitro</em> collections depending on the species conserved and the available facilities in the country.</p>
<p><em>Animal genetic resources</em></p>
<p>For the animal component the indicator is calculated as the number of local breeds with enough genetic material stored within genebank collections allowing to reconstitute the breed in case of extinction (based on the Guidelines on Cryconservation of animal genetic resources, FAO, 2012, <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm">http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm</a>).</p></div><a name="IMPUTATION"></a><div id="IMPUTATION"><p class="concept-name">4.f.

<p>For plants missing values are treated as such and not replaced by estimates. For animals, for a given breed, if no data are provided for a respective year, it is assumed that the storage status remains the same as for the last year for which data have been reported. In this case the nature of data is considered to be estimated. However, if the most recent reporting refers to a year more than 10- years before, the storage status is considered &#x201C;unknown&#x201D;. </p>

Out of the 12 passport descriptors which can be used to characterize each accession, four are mandatory: (i) the name of the genebank (or <em>holding institute code</em>); (ii) the <em>accession number</em><sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[1]</a></sup>; (iii) the scientific name of the accession (<em>name of taxon</em>, including genus, species and lower taxonomic ranking); and (iv) the type of storage. Reporting on the remaining descriptors is highly recommended, as it allows the analysis of changes in different types of diversity concerned, including changes in the type and origin of the material secured (e.g. <em>biological status</em>; <em>country of origin</em>; <em>locations of safety duplications</em>; etc.) and better describes the composition of the secured materials. The descriptors have been agreed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (see question 6.2 in the &#x201C;Reporting format for monitoring the implementation of the Second global Plan of Action for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture&#x201D; <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-mm294e.pdf">http://www.fao.org/3/a-mm294e.pdf</a>).

<p>For the animal component the National Coordinators for the Management of Animal Genetic Resources provide the type of material (e.g. semen samples, embryos, somatic cells) cryo-conserved within the framework of a cryconservation programme, as well as the number of the respective male and female donors to the Domestic Animal Diversity Information System DAD-IS.</p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup class="footnote-number" id="footnote-2">1</sup><p> <a href="#footnote-ref-2">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div></div><a name="QUALITY_ASSURE"></a><div id="QUALITY_ASSURE"><p class="concept-name">4.j.

<p><em>Plant genetic resources</em></p>
<p>The data collected as part of the first monitoring cycle of the implementation of the Second Global Plan of Action for PGRFA serve as baseline (number of accessions as of June 2014). </p>
<p>As of February 2019, data on over 5 million accessions from 98 countries and 17 international/regional centres are being published. The data collection is carried out annually in January. Continued efforts are made to improve the coverage of countries and international/regional centres, as well as the quality of the information.</p>
<p><em>Animal genetic resources</em></p>
<p>The analysis of country reports to FAO provided by 128 countries in 2014 for the preparation of &#x2018;The Second Report on the State of the World&#x2019;s Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture&#x2019; provided a first baseline with regard to the number of national breed populations where sufficient material is stored. As of March 2018 the information reported in DAD-IS was still scarce. According to DAD-IS, genetic material is cryoconserved for only a very low proportion (3 percent) of local breeds and for only around 1 percent of breeds is the quantity of stored material estimated to be sufficient for population reconstitution. The data from the Country Reports are not directly comparable with the data in DAD-IS, because the Country Reports refer also to transboundary breeds. However, the results based on DAD-IS data underline the urgent need for countries to report information relating to cryconserved material in DAD-IS.</p>
