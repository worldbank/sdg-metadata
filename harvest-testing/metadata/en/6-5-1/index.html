Related indicators</p><p>As it measures the degree of implementation of an enabling environment for better water resources management, it directly supports the other outcome targets under SDG 6 (6.1 &#x2013; 6.6). It does this by providing further information to countries on the context and possible explanation for the progress on other targets, and points to barriers and enablers to obtaining the other targets. It also directly supports the means of implementation targets 6.a and 6.b, as disaggregation is possible to provide data on financing (6.a) and stakeholder participation (6.b). Beyond SDG 6, indicator 6.5.1 has linkages with a number of other targets across the SDGs, as integrated water resources management is concerned with integrating the demands and impacts on water resources and water-related ecosystems from a number of different SDGs and their targets, including: poverty (1.4); agriculture (2.3); education (4.7); gender (5.5); energy (7.1); work (8.5); equality (10.2); urban areas (11.3); climate change (13.2); ecosystems (15.9); governance (16.3, 16.5 &#x2013; 16.7) (UN-Water 2016).</p></div><a name="SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES"></a><div id="SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES"><p class="concept-name">0.g.

Definition and concepts</p><p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
<p>Indicator 6.5.1 is &#x2018;degree of integrated water resources management implementation&#x2019;. It measures the stages of development and implementation of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), on a scale of 0 to 100, in six categories (see Rationale section). The indicator score is calculated from a country survey with 33 questions, with each question scored on the same scale of 0-100. </p>
<p>The definition of IWRM is based on an internationally agreed definition, and is universally applicable. IWRM was officially established in 1992 and is defined as &#x201C;a process which promotes the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources in order to maximise economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems.&#x201D; (GWP 2010). </p>
<p>The method builds on official UN IWRM status reporting, from 2008 and 2012, of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation from the UN World Summit for Sustainable Development (1992).</p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p>The concept of IWRM is measured in 4 main sections, each representing key dimension of IWRM: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Enabling environment: this includes the policies, laws, plans and strategies which create the &#x2018;enabling environment&#x2019; for IWRM. </li>
  <li>Institutions and participation: includes the range and roles of political, social, economic and administrative institutions that help to support the implementation of IWRM. </li>
  <li>Management Instruments: The tools and activities that enable decision-makers and users to make rational and informed choices between alternative actions. </li>
  <li>Financing: Budgeting and financing made available and used for water resources development and management from various sources.</li>
</ol>
<p>The indicator is based on a national survey structured around these four main sections. Each section is split into two parts: questions concerning the &#x2018;National level&#x2019; and &#x2018;Other levels&#x2019; respectively. &#x2018;Other levels&#x2019; includes sub-national (including provinces/states for federated countries), basin level, and the transboundary level as appropriate. These two parts address the wording of Target 6.5 &#x2018;implement [IWRM] at all levels &#x2026;&#x2019;.</p></div><a name="UNIT_MEASURE"></a><div id="UNIT_MEASURE"><p class="concept-name">2.b. Unit of measure</p><p>The indicator is measured as a percentage (0-100).</p></div><a name="CLASS_SYSTEM"></a><div id="CLASS_SYSTEM"><p class="concept-name">2.c. Classifications</p><p>The concepts and methodology are broadly accepted by the international community, having been developed over at least five decades. However, there are no international standards per se. </p></div><a name="SOURCE_TYPE"></a><div id="SOURCE_TYPE"><p class="concept-name">3.a. Data sources</p><p>Monitoring progress on meeting SDG 6.5 is owned by and is the responsibility of the national government. The government assigns a ministry with the primary responsibility for overseeing this survey, which then takes on the responsibility of coordinating the national IWRM monitoring and reporting process. As water management issues cut across a wide number of sectors, often overseen by different ministries and other administrative bodies at national or other levels, the process should be inclusive. Major stakeholders should be involved in order to contribute to well informed and objective answers to the survey. </p>
<p>The ministry is invited to nominate a national &#x201C;IWRM focal point&#x201D;, who may or may not be a government official. The UN provides support where needed and possible. The following steps are suggested as guidance only, as it is up to countries to decide which process or processes would best serve their needs. It should also be noted that the following steps represent a &#x2018;ladder&#x2019; approach, in that completing all the steps will generally lead to a more robust indicator. However, it may not be possible or necessary for all countries to complete all steps. </p>
<ol>
  <li>The responsible ministry or IWRM focal point contacts other relevant ministries/agencies to compile responses to the questionnaire. Each possible response option has a score which is used to calculate the overall indicator score.</li>
  <li>The completed draft survey is reviewed by government stakeholders. These stakeholders could include those involved in water-relevant sectors, such as agriculture, energy, water supply and environment, as well as water management at different administrative levels. This process may be electronic (e.g. via email) and/or through workshops. </li>
  <li>The revised draft survey is validated at a multi-stakeholder workshop. Apart from government representatives these stakeholders could include water user associations, private sector, interest groups concerned with e.g. environment, agriculture, poverty, and academia. The suggested process is through a workshop but alternative means of consultation e.g. email or online call for public submissions could be considered. Note that steps 2 and 3 could be combined if desired. </li>
  <li>The responsible ministry or IWRM focal point discusses with relevant officials and consolidates the input into a final version. This version is the basis for calculating the degree of IWRM implementation (0-100) for global reporting. </li>
  <li>The responsible ministry submits the final indicator score to the national statistics office responsible for compiling all national SDG target data. </li>
</ol>
<p>Based on the national survey, UN-Water periodically prepares synthesis reports for regional and global levels to provide overall progress on meeting SDG target 6.5. </p>
<p>Temporal Coverage: A reporting cycle of three years is recommended.</p></div><a name="COLL_METHOD"></a><div id="COLL_METHOD"><p class="concept-name">3.b. Data collection method</p><p>Official counterparts at the country level oversee the validation and consultation process. </p>
<p>The survey has been designed so that the indicator is comparable between countries and time periods. No adjustments are foreseen. </p></div><a name="FREQ_COLL"></a><div id="FREQ_COLL"><p class="concept-name">3.c. Data collection calendar</p><p>Data is collected approximately every 3-4 years. The baseline dataset was collected in 2017, with the second data collection round in 2020. Subsequent data collection rounds are expected in 2023-24, 2026-27, and 2030. Each data collection round spans approximately 9-12 months. </p></div><a name="REL_CAL_POLICY"></a><div id="REL_CAL_POLICY"><p class="concept-name">3.d. Data release calendar</p><p>Data is released approximately 3 months after the close of each data collection round. </p></div><a name="DATA_SOURCE"></a><div id="DATA_SOURCE"><p class="concept-name">3.e. Data providers</p><p>The information required to complete the survey is expected to be held by government officials responsible for water resources management in the country, supported by official documentation. E.g. Ministry of Water in coordination with Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Lands and Agriculture, Ministry of Industry and Mining etc. See also &#x2018;data sources&#x2019; section above. As a minimum, a small group of officials may be able to complete the survey. However, these government officials may belong to various government authorities, and coordination is required to determine and validate the responses to each question. Increased government and non-government stakeholder participation in validating the question scores will lead to a more robust indicator score and facilitate tracking progress over time.</p></div><a name="COMPILING_ORG"></a><div id="COMPILING_ORG"><p class="concept-name">3.f.

Rationale</p><p>The indicator provides a direct progress measurement of the first part of Target 6.5 &#x201C;&#x2026;implement integrated water resources management at all levels &#x2026;&#x201D;. The indicator score provides an easy and understandable way of measuring progress towards the target, with &#x2018;0&#x2019; interpreted as no implementation of IWRM, and &#x2018;100&#x2019; interpreted as IWRM being fully implemented.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To further aid interpretation and comparison, the indicator results can be categorized as follows: </p>

<p>The concept of the survey is that it provides sufficient information to be of real value to the countries in determining their progress towards the target, and through this, various aspects of IWRM. A balance has been sought between providing sufficient information to cover the core principles of IWRM, and thus providing a robust indicator value, and not overburdening countries with unnecessary reporting requirements. </p>
<p>Countries are encouraged to provide additional information on each question, which may help to qualify their choice of score, and/or put that score into their national context. </p>
<p>Indicator 6.5.1 is supported by indicator 6.5.2 &#x201C;Proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation&#x201D;, which directly addresses the portion of Target 6.5 &#x201C;&#x2026;, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate.&#x201D;.</p></div><a name="REC_USE_LIM"></a><div id="REC_USE_LIM"><p class="concept-name">4.b. Comment and limitations</p><p>The challenge of subjectivity in responses associated with this type of survey is being addressed in a number of ways: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Draft responses are reviewed by a number of governmental and non-governmental stakeholders in an open, inclusive and transparent process. </li>
  <li>Countries are encouraged to provide further information to qualify their responses and/or set them in the national context. </li>
  <li>Guidelines are provided for each of the four main sections, each question, and each of the six thresholds for every single question, to ensure responses are as objective as possible, and are comparable both between countries, and between reporting periods. </li>
</ol>
<p>To achieve robust indicator results requires a country process involving a wide range of stakeholders which requires a certain amount of time and resources. The advantage of this is that it puts in place a process that addresses the integrated and indivisible nature of the SDG targets, as well as stressing the importance of &#x201C;leaving no on behind&#x201D;.</p></div><a name="DATA_COMP"></a><div id="DATA_COMP"><p class="concept-name">4.c. Method of computation</p><ol>
  <li>The survey contains 33 questions divided into the four main sections described above. </li>
  <li>Each question is given a score between 0 and 100, in increments of 10, guided by threshold descriptions for the following 6 categories:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>Very low (0)</li>
  <li>Low (20)</li>
  <li>Medium-low (40)</li>
  <li>Medium-high (60)</li>
  <li>High (80)</li>
  <li>Very high (100)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that guidance is provided for each threshold for each question, to ensure objective and comparable results. </p>
<ol>
  <li>The un-weighted average of the question scores within each of the four sections is calculated to give a score of 0 &#x2013; 100 for each section, rounded to the nearest whole number. </li>
  <li>The section scores (rounded to the nearest whole number), are averaged (un-weighted), and rounded to the nearest whole number, to give the indicator score, expressed as a number between 0 and 100.</li>
</ol></div><a name="DATA_VALIDATION"></a><div id="DATA_VALIDATION"><p class="concept-name">4.d. Validation</p><p>There is a dedicated SDG 6.5.1 Help Desk for ensuring the quality of the statistical results. Firstly, the data goes through any national quality assurance and approval processes, before being submitted to the Help Desk. The Help Desk then undertakes the Quality Assurance procedure described in section 4.j. All issues are discussed between the Help Desk and the Focal Point(s). Only when all issues are resolved, are the data finalised and entered into the Help Desk Database. The data is then submitted to the UNEP SDG focal point, who collates all indicator data for which UNEP is the Custodian Agency, where a further quality check is undertaken, prior to submission to the SDGs Indicator Database. </p></div><a name="ADJUSTMENT"></a><div id="ADJUSTMENT"><p class="concept-name">4.e.

  <li>National focal points selected by each country. </li>
  <li>National focal points are responsible for coordinating a national process to engage governmental and non-governmental stakeholders, as appropriate in the context of each country, to develop draft responses and finalise responses. This may be via email, workshops, and online notices. </li>
  <li>The following materials are available for national focal points in 7 languages (English, Spanish, French, Arabic, Russian, Chinese, Portuguese), at <a href="http://iwrmdataportal.unepdhi.org">http://iwrmdataportal.unepdhi.org</a>: the survey (MS Word); a detailed monitoring guide; and a PowerPoint presentation and video recording. In addition, focal points may access the following materials: the 2017 baseline surveys and 2-page results summaries (for 172 countries); and 2017 workshop reports (for 36 countries). </li>
  <li>In addition, an &#x201C;SDG 6.5.1 Facilitator&#x2019;s Training Course&#x201D; is available online via <a href="http://www.gwp.org/en/sdg6support/consultations/stage-1-activities/training-of-facilitators/">www.gwp.org/en/sdg6support/consultations/stage-1-activities/training-of-facilitators/</a> , through the SDG 6 IWRM Support Programme. </li>
  <li>A more comprehensive &#x201C;IWRM Stage 1 Support Package&#x201D; is available for a limited number of countries (approximately 60 countries in 2020). The Support Package includes seed funding to engage a Facilitator to support the stakeholder consultation process. </li>
</ol>
<p>Extensive explanations are provided in the monitoring guide and in the survey itself. The survey contains: an overall introduction and explanation; a glossary; an introduction and glossary in each of the four sections; threshold descriptions for six thresholds for each question; and a number of footnotes to explain aspects of questions or threshold descriptions. All materials can be downloaded from <a href="http://iwrmdataportal.unepdhi.org">http://iwrmdataportal.unepdhi.org</a>. In addition, a dedicated Help Desk is available to provide assistance at all times. The Help Desk is accessible via email <a href="mailto:iwrmsdg651@un.org">iwrmsdg651@un.org</a>.</p></div><a name="QUALITY_MGMNT"></a><div id="QUALITY_MGMNT"><p class="concept-name">4.i. Quality management</p><p>UNEP-DHI Centre, which manages the statistical reporting processes for UNEP on indicator 6.5.1, operates through a Business Management System that fulfils the requirements of ISO 9001 (quality management), which covers relevant areas such as consulting and capacity development and training courses. </p></div><a name="QUALITY_ASSURE"></a><div id="QUALITY_ASSURE"><p class="concept-name">4.j. Quality assurance</p><p>The following quality assurance guidelines are available to all individuals involved in quality assurance for 6.5.1. </p>
<p>Process: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Nominate person responsible for QA for a country response once it is submitted for the first time. </li>
  <li>Acknowledge receipt and inform the country of QA process. </li>
  <li>Update QA spreadsheet, indicating date of receipt and who submitted. </li>
  <li>Upload draft survey (MS Word) to the Dropbox folder. </li>
  <li>Undertake ALL checks described below. </li>
  <li>If there are any discrepancies, revert to UNEP-DHI colleagues. </li>
  <li>Once action is agreed, respond to the countries. </li>
  <li>Complete all checks on each subsequent version of the questionnaire until all quality issues are resolved and questionnaire is marked &#x2018;final&#x2019;. </li>
</ol>
<p>Checks: </p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Focal point:</strong> Confirm the person submitting is the formal national focal point. If not, any reply should also add the national focal point in CC. </li>
  <li><strong>Cover sheet:</strong> check if cover sheet is correctly filled out. Cross-check if the person submitting is the formal national focal point. If not, any reply should include the national focal point in CC.</li>
  <li><strong>Question scores and calculations:</strong> In the spreadsheet &#x2018;Quality_Assurance_651_2020.xlsx&#x2019; on Dropbox, fill in the given responses in sheet &#x201C;QA 2020 scores-status&#x201D;. Make following checks to scores:<ol>
      <li>All questions answered. The official guidance is that all questions should be answered (either with a score or n/a). </li>
      <li>If there is confusion about whether to score or use &#x2018;n/a&#x2019; for sub-national level questions, this list of administrative divisions by country may help in our understanding of the sub-national level(s) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_administrative_divisions_by_country%20">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_administrative_divisions_by_country </a> </li>
      <li>Scores are in range from 0-100, in increments of 10. If they only give &#x2018;even&#x2019; scores (e.g. 0, 20, 40 etc), then they may not have understood that they can also give &#x2018;odd&#x2019; scores (10, 30, 50 etc), if they feel their situation lies between two threshold descriptions.</li>
      <li>Any differences between &#x2018;given&#x2019; and &#x2018;calculated&#x2019; section scores and overall score are given in columns C &#x2013; G. If the difference is greater than +/- 0.5, the cells are automatically highlighted in red using conditional formatting. One also has to fill in the date of last submission in column B, otherwise the differences will not be calculated. </li>
      <li>Compare with baseline (2017). The QA &#x2018;2017 Comparison&#x2019; spreadsheet automatically calculates differences. Note any negative changes (orange), or increases of more than 20 (yellow). If there are any significant/unexpected differences, the country should have given some explanation in the free text fields. </li>
      <li>In the &#x2018;given&#x2019; calculations (section 5 of the survey instrument), check that section averages and overall score are rounded to the nearest whole number. Rounding mistakes might occur.</li>
      <li>Note: in the calculations, 0 scores are included, and N/A scores should be omitted. N/A scores should always have explanation (unless obvious &#x2013; e.g. transboundary questions for island states).</li>
      <li>Check if the final score is calculated as average of rounded section averages.</li>
      <li>In the free text responses in columns (BE-BF) in the main &#x201C;QA 2020-score status&#x201D; tab, for assigning Low/ Medium/ High categories the following criteria should be followed: <u>Low:</u> Less than three quarters of questions have responses and/or responses are poor quality. <u>Medium:</u> At least three quarters of the questions have responses, and/or responses are varying quality. Each question and the points make sense and are useful. <u>High:</u> All questions have responses and most responses are high quality. NB: Quality responses mean ones that are useful/ informative/ detailed and can contribute to stakeholder understanding/ discussions and plannings.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Free text fields: </strong>Using the &#x2018;text&#x2019; tabs: <ol>
      <li>Check that the free text make sense in the context of the score (and vice versa) (particularly in the case of (n/a or 100 responses).</li>
      <li>Check that n/a (not applicable) is used appropriately. i.e. only if the question is not applicable to the country. In some cases, a score of zero should be given, and in others, perhaps they need more help to figure out how to answer the question. </li>
      <li>Guidance for assigning Low/ Medium/ High categories: Low: Blank or not useful. Medium: Some text and details. High: Useful amount of text and detail than can contribute to stakeholder understanding/consensus and planning.</li>

<p><strong>ANNEXES</strong>. </p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Annex B: Transboundary level:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Check the &#x2018;transboundary basins&#x2019; table. A full list of transboundary basins can be found here: <a href="http://twap-rivers.org/indicators/Report.ashx?type=IndicatorResultsSummary">http://twap-rivers.org/indicators/Report.ashx?type=IndicatorResultsSummary</a>. Go to the final worksheet/tab to see the countries in each basin. You can also check the maps here: <a href="http://twap-rivers.org/indicators/%20">http://twap-rivers.org/indicators/ </a>to see if the basin is likely to be important for that country, or if there is only a small portion of the basin in their country (in which case they may not list it).</li>
      <li>For transboundary aquifers, check: <a href="https://apps.geodan.nl/igrac/ggis-viewer/viewer/twap/public/default">https://apps.geodan.nl/igrac/ggis-viewer/viewer/twap/public/default</a> </li>
      <li>In case any sub-basins are listed, check that the main basin name is included in brackets. </li>
      <li>Check the transboundary questions: 1.2c; 2.2e; 3.2d; and 4.2c, and see if these make sense in the context of the country. </li>
      <li>Island countries should give &#x2018;n/a&#x2019; for all of these questions that relate to transboundary waters. </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Annex C: Barriers / enablers:</strong> is this filled out? Low, moderate, or high level of information? <ol>
      <li> Guidance for assigning Low/ Medium/ High categories: <u>Low:</u> Less than 1 point for each question. <u>Medium:</u> At least one point for each question and the points make sense and are useful. <u>High:</u> Useful analysis that would contribute to future planning.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Annex D:</strong> Priorities: completed (Yes/No/Partially)? Any info in the &#x2018;comments&#x2019; field (low, moderate, high level of info there?)<ol>
      <li>Guidance for assigning Low/ Medium/ High categories: Low: Blank to few words. Medium: A few useful points. High: A longer analysis/ commentary.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Annex E: Country process:</strong> level of info in the free text field, the table, and in the &#x2018;additional info&#x2019; field completed. <ol>
      <li>Guidance for assigning Low/ Medium/ High categories: <u>Low</u>: Blank to few words. <u>Medium</u>: Minimum info to be useful to understand transparency. <u>High</u>: More detailed description that gives good idea of robustness and transparency of the process. </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

Data availability and disaggregation</p><p>Data availability:</p>
<p>Total number of countries: 185 (96% of UN Member States) (UNEP 2020) </p>
<p>The following covers the region (UNSD regional groupings): followed by the number of countries with data / total countries in region (as of 2020); followed by the percentage of countries with data.</p>

<p>Disaggregation:</p>
<p>The strength of the indicator lies in the potential for disaggregating the country score into the four main dimensions of IWRM, and further to the questions in the survey. This provides countries with a quick assessment of which aspects of IWRM are progressing well, and which aspects require increased efforts to reach the target. </p>
<p>The nature of the target, indicator and survey does not lend itself to disaggregation by sex, age group, income etc. However, social equality is an integral part of IWRM, and there are questions which directly address issues such as gender, vulnerable groups, geographic coverage and broad stakeholder participation in water resources development and management. These questions provide an indication of the national and sub-national situation regarding social equality.</p></div><a name="COMPARABILITY"></a><div id="COMPARABILITY"><p class="concept-name">6.
