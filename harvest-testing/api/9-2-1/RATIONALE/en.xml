&lt;p&gt;MVA is a well-recognized and widely used indicator by researchers and policy makers to assess the level of industrialization of a country. The share of MVA in GDP reflects the role of manufacturing in the economy and a country&amp;#x2019;s national development in general. MVA per capita is the basic indicator of a country&amp;#x2019;s level of industrialization adjusted for the size of the economy. One of the statistical uses of MVA per capita is classifying country groups according to the stage of industrial development.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
