The gross value added generated by any unit engaged in production activity can be calculated as the residual of the units&#x2019; total output less intermediate consumption, goods and services used up in the process of producing the output, or as the sum of the factor incomes generated by the production process (System of National Accounts 2008). Manufacturing refers to industries belonging to the sector C defined by International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 4, or D defined by ISIC Revision 3.</p>\n<p>GDP represents the sum of gross value added from all institutional units resident in the economy. For the purpose on comparability over time and across countries MVA and GDP are estimated in terms of constant prices in USD. The current series are given at constant prices of 2015.</p><p>MVA as a proportion of GDP is measure in percentages, MVA per capita in constant 2015 USD.</p><p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/docs/SNA2008.pdf\">System of National Accounts 2008</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/seriesm/seriesm_4rev4e.pdf\">International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 4</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/seriesm/seriesm_4rev3_1e.pdf\">International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 3</a></p><p>UNIDO maintains the MVA database.

UNIDO&#x2019;s mandate covers (i) the maintenance and updating of international industrial statistics databases; (ii) methodological and analytical products based on statistical research and experience of maintaining internationally comparable statistics; (iii) contributions to the development and implementation of international statistical standards and methodology; and (iv) technical cooperation services to countries in the field of industrial statistics. With the repositioning of UNIDO as the focal agency for inclusive and sustainable industrial development (ISID), its statistical mandate was expanded to cover all dimensions of industrial development, including its inclusiveness and environmental sustainability.</p><p>MVA is a well-recognized and widely used indicator by researchers and policy makers to assess the level of industrialization of a country. The share of MVA in GDP reflects the role of manufacturing in the economy and a country&#x2019;s national development in general. MVA per capita is the basic indicator of a country&#x2019;s level of industrialization adjusted for the size of the economy. One of the statistical uses of MVA per capita is classifying country groups according to the stage of industrial development.</p><p>Differences may appear due to different versions of System of National Accounts (SNA) or ISIC revisions used by countries.</p><p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi>M</mi>\n    <mi>V</mi>\n    <mi>A</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>a</mi>\n    <mi>s</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>a</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>p</mi>\n    <mi>r</mi>\n    <mi>o</mi>\n    <mi>p</mi>\n    <mi>o</mi>\n    <mi>r</mi>\n    <mi>t</mi>\n    <mi>i</mi>\n    <mi>o</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>i</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>G</mi>\n    <mi>D</mi>\n    <mi>P</mi>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>M</mi>\n        <mi>V</mi>\n        <mi>A</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>G</mi>\n        <mi>D</mi>\n        <mi>P</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n    <mi>*</mi>\n    <mn>100</mn>\n  </math></p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi>M</mi>\n    <mi>V</mi>\n    <mi>A</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>p</mi>\n    <mi>e</mi>\n    <mi>r</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>c</mi>\n    <mi>a</mi>\n    <mi>p</mi>\n    <mi>i</mi>\n    <mi>t</mi>\n    <mi>a</mi>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>M</mi>\n        <mi>V</mi>\n        <mi>A</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>p</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>p</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n  </math></p><p>UNIDO engages with countries in regular consultations during the data collection process to ensure the data quality and international comparability.</p><p>UNSD collects national accounts data through a regular consultation with countries and areas by sending the UN NAQ to obtain important information about differences in concept, scope, coverage and classification used.
