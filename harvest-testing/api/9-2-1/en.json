The gross value added generated by any unit engaged in production activity can be calculated as the residual of the units&#x2019; total output less intermediate consumption, goods and services used up in the process of producing the output, or as the sum of the factor incomes generated by the production process (System of National Accounts 2008). Manufacturing refers to industries belonging to the sector C defined by International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 4, or D defined by ISIC Revision 3.</p>\n<p>GDP represents the sum of gross value added from all institutional units resident in the economy. For the purpose on comparability over time and across countries MVA and GDP are estimated in terms of constant prices in USD. The current series are given at constant prices of 2015.</p><h1>Data sources</h1>\n<h2>Description:</h2>\n<p>UNIDO maintains MVA database. Figures for updates are obtained from national account estimates produced by UN Statistics Division (UNSD) and from official publications.</p><h2>Collection process:</h2>\n<p>The MVA and GDP country data are collected through a national accounts questionnaire (NAQ) sent by UNSD.

The share of MVA in GDP reflects the role of manufacturing in the economy and a country&#x2019;s national development in general. MVA per capita is the basic indicator of a country&#x2019;s level of industrialization adjusted for the size of the economy. One of the statistical uses of MVA per capita is classifying country groups according to the stage of industrial development.</p><h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n<p>Differences may appear due to different versions of System of National Accounts (SNA) or ISIC revisions used by countries.</p><h1>Methodology</h1>\n<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n<p>MVA proportion to GDP = MVA/GDP*100.</p>\n<p>MVA per capita = MVA/population</p><h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Boudt, Todorov, Upadhyaya (2009): Nowcasting manufacturing value added for cross-country comparison; Statistical Journal of IAOS</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>At regional and global levels:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>No imputation used.</p><h2>Regional aggregates:</h2>\n<p>Regional, global aggregation of direct summation of country values within the country groups.</p><h2>Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level:</h2>\n<p>International Recommendations for Industrial Statistics (IRIS) 2008 <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/seriesM/seriesm_90e.pdf\">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/seriesM/seriesm_90e.pdf</a></p>\n<p>System of National Accounts (SNA) 2008 <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/seriesf/SeriesF_2Rev5e.pdf\">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/seriesf/SeriesF_2Rev5e.pdf</a></p>\n<p>International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl=27\">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl=27</a></p><h2>Quality assurance:</h2>\n<p>UNIDO (2009), UNIDO Data Quality: A quality assurance framework for UNIDO statistical activities <a href=\"https://open.unido.org/api/documents/4814740/download/UNIDO-Publication-2009-4814740\">https://open.unido.org/api/documents/4814740/download/UNIDO-Publication-2009-4814740</a> </p><h1>Data availability</h1>\n<h2>Description:</h2>\n<p>For more than 200 economies</p>\n<h2>Time series:</h2>\n<p>Data for this indicator are available as of 2000 in the UN Global SDG Database, but longer time series are available in the UNIDO MVA database.</p>\n<h2>Disaggregation:</h2>\n<p>No disaggregation available.</p><h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>\n<p>Minor differences may arise due to 1) exchange rates for conversion to USD 2) different base years used for constant price data 3) methods for recent period estimation and 4) different versions of SNA and ISIC revisions used by countries.</p><h1>References</h1>\n<h2>URL:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.unido.org/statistics\">www.unido.org/statistics</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/methodology.pdf\">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/methodology.pdf</a><br><a href=\"https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2015_Methodology.pdf\">https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2015_Methodology.pdf</a></p>\n<h2>References:</h2>\n<p>International Yearbook of Industrial Statistics; UNIDO</p>\n<p>International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities 2008</p>\n<p>System of National Accounts 2008</p>"}
