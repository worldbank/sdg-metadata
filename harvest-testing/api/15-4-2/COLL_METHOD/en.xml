	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Collection process:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is generated for all countries and regions having mountain areas by FAO using the geospatial data layers described in this document. FAO shares country figures with NSO SDG focal points for their validation before publication, in accordance to the IAEG-SDG guidelines of Global Data Flows and Reporting. On the same occasion, FAO requests countries to provide their own estimates for the indicator in case these are available. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
