	<message>The REG_AGG field for indicator 15-4-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Regional aggregates:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using spatially explicit data allows straightforward calculation of the indicator value for any delineated area. However, giving the spatial resolution of 300 meters of the CCI layer, calculation of the indicator values for smallest regions consisting of only few pixels may results in abrupt changes in the indicator values due to the relatively higher impact of classification errors. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
