This methodology adheres to the UNEP- WCMC mountain definition, relying in turn on the mountain description proposed by (Kapos, Rhind, Edwards, Prince, &amp; Ravillous, 2000).</p>\n<p>This description classifies mountains according altitude, slope and elevation range into 6 categories.</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Mountain Class</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Description </p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>1</p>\n      </td>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p>Elevation &gt; 4.500 meters</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>2</p>\n      </td>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p>Elevation 3.500&#x2013;4.500 meters</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>3</p>\n      </td>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p>Elevation 2.500&#x2013;3.500 meters</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>4</p>\n      </td>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p>Elevation 1.500&#x2013;2.500 meters and slope &gt; 2</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>5</p>\n      </td>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p>Elevation 1.000&#x2013;1.500 meters and slope &gt; 5 or local elevation range (LER 7 kilometer radius) &gt; 300 meters</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>6</p>\n      </td>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p>Elevation 300&#x2013;1.000 meters and local elevation range (7 kilometer radius) &gt; 300 meters</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p><u>2. A vegetation descriptor layer</u>: The vegetation descriptor layer categorizes land cover into green and non-green areas. Green vegetation includes both natural vegetation and vegetation resulting from anthropic activity (e.g. crops, afforestation, etc.). Non-green areas include very&#xA0;sparsely&#xA0;vegetated&#xA0;areas, bare land, water, permanent ice/snow and urban areas. The vegetation description layer can be derived in different ways, but remote sensing based land cover maps are the most convenient data source for this purpose, as they provide the required information on green and non-green areas in a spatially explicit manner and allow for comparison over time through land cover change analysis. </p>\n<p>Currently, FAO uses land cover time series produced by the European Space Agency (ESA) under the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) as a general solution. The original CCI classes are re-classified into six IPCC classes and further into binary green/non-green cover classes as follows:</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>ESA CCI class</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>IPCC class</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Green / Non green</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>50, 60, 61, 62, 70, 71, 72, 80, 81, 82, 90, 100</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Forest<sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-ref-1\">[1]</a></sup></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Green</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>110, 120, 121, 122, 130, 140, </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Grassland</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Green</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>10,11, 12, 20, 30, 40</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Cropland</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Green</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>160, 170, 180</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Wetland</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Green</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>190</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Settlement</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Non Green</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>150, 151, 152, 153, 200, 201, 202, 210, 220</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Other land</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Non Green</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-1\">1</sup><p> Please note, that here the term &#x201C;Forest&#x201D; refers to land cover, not necessarily land use <a href=\"#footnote-ref-1\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div><h1>Data sources</h1>\n<h2>Description:</h2>\n<p><strong>1) ESA CCI Land Cover data: </strong></p>\n<p>The European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) is a programme aiming at exploiting the full potential of the earth observation data collected by ESA to contribute to the Essential Climate Variables databases required by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). </p>\n<p>The CCI Land Cover products have been produced using a combination of remote sensing data such as the 300 m MERIS, 1km SPOT &#x2013;VEGETATION, 1km PROBA &#x2013;V and 1km AVHRR. The CCI product consists of a series of annual Land Cover maps at 300 m resolution spanning the period 1992 to 2018. The period from 1992-2015 is available in raster format, whereas the 2016-2018 is available in netCDF format and a transformation to GTIFF is required to make these datasets available for processing in a GIS environment. The land cover data is updated every year by the European Space Agency. </p>\n<p>The ESA CCI adheres to the Cover Classification System of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UN FAO) (Santoro, et al., 2015). </p>\n<p><strong>2) Kapos mountain class layer:</strong></p>\n<p>The Kapos dataset is a global mountain descriptor raster file. The file provides a classification of mountain ranges in accordance with the definitions proposed by Kapos et al 2000 :</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Class 1: elevation &gt; 4500 meters </li>\n  <li>Class 2: elevation 3500 - 4500 meters</li>\n  <li>Class 3: elevation 2500 &#x2013; 3500 meters </li>\n  <li>Class 4: elevation 1500 &#x2013; 2500 meters and slope &#x2265; 2</li>\n  <li>Class 5: elevation 1,000&#x2013;1,500 meters and slope &#x2265; 5 or local elevation range (7 kilometers radius) &#x2265; 300 meters</li>\n  <li>Class 6: elevation 300&#x2013;1,000 meters and local elevation range (7 kilometres radius) &#x2265; 300 meters outside 23&#xB0;N&#x2014;19&#xB0;S </li>\n  <li>Class 0: Defined to represent the non-mountainous areas. </li>\n</ul><h2>Collection process:</h2>\n<p>The indicator is generated for all countries and regions having mountain areas by FAO using the geospatial data layers described in this document. FAO shares country figures with NSO SDG focal points for their validation before publication, in accordance to the IAEG-SDG guidelines of Global Data Flows and Reporting. On the same occasion, FAO requests countries to provide their own estimates for the indicator in case these are available. </p><h1>Calendar</h1>\n<h2>Data collection:</h2>\n<p>ESA CCI Land Cover is available from 1992 to 2018. A new global land cover map is delivered every year.</p><h2>Data release:</h2>\n<p>All data is already available</p><h1>Data providers</h1>\n<p>European Space Agency </p>\n<p>Mountain Partnership, FAO</p>\n<p>USGS </p><h1>Data compilers</h1>\n<p>FAO</p><h2>Rationale:</h2>\n<p>Mountain ecosystems are important biodiversity centres that provide valuable ecosystem services to upstream and downstream areas. Yet, mountains are very fragile and impacted easily by both natural and anthropogenic factors. These can include climate change, natural hazards such as landslides and flooding, unplanned agricultural expansion, unplanned urbanization, timber extraction and recreational activities. The degradation of mountain ecosystems such as loss of the glacial cover, mountain biodiversity and green cover will affect the ability of the ecosystem to supply water downstream. The loss of forest and vegetative cover will reduce the ability of the ecosystem to retain soil and prevent landslides and flooding downstream. </p>\n<p>Therefore, monitoring mountain vegetation changes provides information on the status of mountain ecosystems. Monitoring the MGCI over time can provide information on the extent of vegetational change and of the general health of the mountain ecosystem. Assessing the change of green cover differentiated by elevation is important in understanding the changes that are occurring in the mountain regions due to the influence of slope, aspect and altitude of the mountain terrain to the ecosystem. </p>\n<p>However, the MGCI values should be interpreted with care. It does not provide the details on species change, change in the tree line or rain shadow areas. Understanding the variation in the species composition and the tree line will be important in identifying the long-term impacts of climate change in mountain regions. Analysing the vegetative variations in each of the elevation zones over time will assist in determining the appropriate management and adaption measures. </p>\n<p>In some cases, an increase in the indicator value in high elevation classes may also signify the encroachment of vegetation on areas previously covered by glaciers or other permanent or semi-permanent ice or snow layers, as a result of global warming due to climate change. Such a change can be tracked with the current methodology and flagged accordingly at the level of disaggregated data by land cover type and elevation class, to distinguish this case from the general desired trend of increasing mountain green cover.</p><h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n<p>The indicator can be calculated using freely available Earth Observation data and simple GIS operations that can be processed in free and open source software (FOSS) GIS. </p>\n<p>Potential limitations of the above describe methodology are related mainly to the quality of the land cover data. The ESA CCI land cover maps are currently available at 300 meter resolution which limits their applicability in the monitoring of small and highly heterogeneous landscapes. Therefore, if countries have national land cover maps of higher spatial resolution and comparable or better quality, FAO advises using them, following the same methodology presented here, for the generation of MGCI values. </p>\n<p>Regarding the interpretation of the indicator, although in the great majority of cases the desired direction is an increase in green mountain cover which reflects restriction of damage to natural ecosystems and possibly even the expansion of forest, shrubland and grasslands through conservation efforts, in more limited cases, an increase in the indicator value in high elevation classes may also signify the encroachment of vegetation on areas previously covered by glaciers or other permanent or semi-permanent ice or snow layers, as a result of global warming due to climate change. Such a change can be tracked with the current methodology and flagged accordingly at the level of disaggregated data by land cover type and elevation class, to distinguish this case from the general desired trend of increasing mountain green cover.</p><h1>Methodology</h1>\n<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n<p>The Mountain Green Cover Index is defined as </p>\n<p><em>MGCI = (Mountain Green Cover Area/Total Mountain Area) X 100</em></p>\n<p>Where Mountain Green Cover area = Sum of areas covered by Cropland, Grassland, Forest and Wetland land cover classes.</p>\n<p>The vegetation descriptor is calculated from a land cover map using basic GIS functions. </p>\n<p>If the country/region has no mountain area, it will be assigned value N/A.</p><h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not applicable, as the indicator has a universal coverage</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>At regional and global levels:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not applicable, as the indicator has a universal coverage</p><h2>Regional aggregates:</h2>\n<p>Using spatially explicit data allows straightforward calculation of the indicator value for any delineated area. However, giving the spatial resolution of 300 meters of the CCI layer, calculation of the indicator values for smallest regions consisting of only few pixels may results in abrupt changes in the indicator values due to the relatively higher impact of classification errors. </p><h2>Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level:</h2>\n<p>The indicator value&#xA0;can be calculated as follows:&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>The ESA&#xA0;CCI&#xA0;land cover classes&#xA0;are&#xA0;reclassified into six IPCC classes&#xA0;and Green/Non-Green&#xA0;cover&#xA0;map.&#xA0;</li>\n  <li>The Kapos Elevation Ranges map&#xA0;is&#xA0;overlaid on top of the&#xA0;map resulting from step 1.&#xA0;</li>\n  <li>Zonal histogram&#xA0;is&#xA0;calculated for each country&#xA0;and&#xA0;regional&#xA0;grouping in such a way that the number of pixels belonging to green and&#xA0;non-green&#xA0;classes&#xA0;are&#xA0;counted within each elevation&#xA0;range.&#xA0;</li>\n  <li>The ratio (%) between the sum of the green pixels and the total number of pixels (green plus non green) falling within each&#xA0;Kapos&#xA0;is&#xA0;calculated to obtain MGCI&#xA0;values per each&#xA0;Kapos&#xA0;class.&#xA0;</li>\n  <li>The same procedure&#xA0;is&#xA0;used to calculate the distribution of the land cover&#xA0;classes as defined by IPCC within each elevation range.&#xA0;</li>\n</ol><h2>Quality assurance:</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Country figures generated by FAO are sent to official NSO SDG focal points for validation before publication.</li>\n</ul><h1>Data availability</h1>\n<p>The indicator is generated by geospatial data and therefore has universal coverage.
