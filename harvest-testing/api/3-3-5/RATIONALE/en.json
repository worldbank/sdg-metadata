{"status":"success","message":"The RATIONALE field for indicator 3-3-5, translated into en","data":"<p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>\n<p>The average annual number of people requiring treatment and care for NTDs is the number that is expected to decrease toward &#x201C;the end of NTDs&#x201D; by 2030 (target 3.3), as NTDs are eradicated, eliminated or controlled. The number of people requiring other interventions against NTDs (e.g. vector management, veterinary public health, water, sanitation and hygiene) are expected to need to be maintained beyond 2030 and are therefore to be addressed in the context of other targets and indicators, namely Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and universal access to water and sanitation.</p>\n<p>This number should not be interpreted as the number of people at risk for NTDs. It is in fact a subset of the larger number of people at risk. Mass treatment is limited to those living in districts above a threshold level of prevalence; it does not include all people living in districts with any risk of infection. Individual treatment and care is for those who are or have already been infected; it does not include all contacts and others at risk of infection. This number can better be interpreted as the number of people at a level of risk requiring medical intervention &#x2013; that is, treatment and care for NTDs.</p>"}
