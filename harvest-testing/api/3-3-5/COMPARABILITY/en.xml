	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries do not typically aggregate their data across NTDs, but if they applied the aggregation method as described above, they would obtain the same number. The only exceptions would be countries with one or more missing values for individual NTDs. In these exceptional cases, internationally estimated aggregates will be higher than country produced aggregates that assume missing values are nil. We present best estimates with uncertainty intervals to highlight those missing values that have a significant impact on country aggregates, until such time that missing values are reported.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
