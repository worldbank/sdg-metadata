Successful interventions against NTDs contribute to meeting other SDGs, such as alleviating poverty (Goal 1) and hunger (Goal 2), enabling people to pursue an education (Goal 4) and lead productive working lives (Goal 8) and promoting equality, for example with regard to gender (Goals 5 and 10). Progress towards other Goals can accelerate the achievement of NTD goals. For example, wider provision of clean water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) (Goal 6) is believed to help to eliminate or control NTDs; the availability of resilient infrastructure (Goal 9) should facilitate delivery of medicines and outreach to remote communities; the goals of sustainable cities (Goal 11) and climate action (Goal 13) can support the environmental management necessary for control of disease vectors. Attaining all SDGs and NTD goals is founded on strong global partnerships (Goal 17).</p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
