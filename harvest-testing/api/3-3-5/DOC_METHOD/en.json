{"status":"success","message":"The DOC_METHOD field for indicator 3-3-5, translated into en","data":"<h2>Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level:</h2>\n<p>This indicator is based on national-level data reported to WHO by its Member States and disseminated via the WHO Global Health Observatory (<a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/neglected_diseases/en/\">http://www.who.int/gho/neglected_diseases/en/</a>) and <a href=\"https://unitednations-my.sharepoint.com/personal/shibata_un_org/Documents/New%20Zin/wordH/updated/PC\"><u>PC</u></a> Data Portal (<a href=\"http://apps.who.int/gho/cabinet/pc.jsp\">http://apps.who.int/gho/cabinet/pc.jsp</a>). Some adjustment is required to aggregate country-reported data on individual neglected tropical diseases across all NTDs included in this indicator. There is an established methodology to standardize this aggregation: <a href=\"http://www.who.int/wer/2012/wer8702.pdf%20\">http://www.who.int/wer/2012/wer8702.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Following a recommendation by the Working Group on Monitoring and Evaluation of the Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for NTDs, WHO has led the development of an integrated NTD database to improve evidence-based planning and management of NTD programmes at the national and sub-national levels. The Integrated NTD database is available here: <a href=\"http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/data/ntddatabase/en/\">http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/data/ntddatabase/en/</a>. </p>\n<p>For NTDs requiring preventive chemotherapy, a joint reporting mechanism and set of reporting forms have been developed to facilitate the process of requesting donated medicines and reporting progress as well as to improve coordination and integration among programmes, more information is available here, <a href=\"http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/preventive_chemotherapy/reporting/en/\">http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/preventive_chemotherapy/reporting/en/</a></p>\n<p>For the other NTDs, the number of new cases should be reported by the health facilities to the national level in order to compile them. If active case search activities are organized (e.g. for integrated skin NTDs, human African trypanosomiasis, etc.), the country must ensure that the number of new cases detected through these activities are also reported, either through the health facilities or directly to the national level. A strong health information system is essential for countries to be able to collect, compile and analyse good quality information on these NTDs.</p>"}
