WHO also collaborates to supply ivermectin for onchocerciasis (ONCHO) and lymphatic filariasis elimination programmes. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A joint mechanism and a set of forms have been developed to facilitate the process of application, review and reporting as well as to improve coordination and integration among different programmes. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Joint Request for Selected PC Medicines (JRSM) &#x2013; designed to assist countries in quantifying the number of tablets of the relevant medicines required to reach the planned target population and districts in a coordinated and integrated manner against multiple diseases during the year for which medicines are requested. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Joint Reporting Form (JRF) &#x2013; designed to assist countries in reporting annual progress on integrated and coordinated distribution of medicines across PC-NTDs in the reporting year in a standardized format. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PC Epidemiological Data Reporting Form (EPIRF) &#x2013; designed to standardize national reporting of epidemiological data on lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, soil-transmitted helminthiases and schistosomiasis. National authorities are encouraged to complete this form and submit it to WHO on a yearly basis, together with the JRF. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The reports generated in the JRSM and in the JRF (SUMMARY worksheets) must be printed and signed by the NTD coordinator or a Ministry of Health representative to formally endorse the country&#x2019;s request for these medicines and the reported annual progress of the national programme(s). The date of signature must also be included. Once signatures have been obtained, the scanned copies of the two worksheets, together with the full Excel versions of the JRSM, the JRF and the EPIRF can be jointly submitted to WHO. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The forms are submitted to the WHO Representative of the concerned WHO Country office with electronic copies to <em><u>PC_JointForms@who.int</u></em> and the concerned Regional focal point, no later than 15 August of the year preceding the year for which medicines are intended to be used (e.g. at the latest by 15 August 2015 for implementation of preventive chemotherapy in 2016) but at least 6-8 months before the planned PC intervention(s) to allow time for reviewing and approval of the request, placing order, manufacturing PC medicines and shipment to the country. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><u> https://www.who.int/teams/control-of-neglected-tropical-diseases/preventive-chemotherapy/joint-application-package </u> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>NTDs requiring individual diagnosis and treatment</strong> </p>\n<p>Countries are invited to report on Buruli ulcer, Chagas disease, leprosy, the leishmaniases, mycetoma, rabies and yaws cases using Excel templates or directly into the WHO integrated data platform (<a href=\"https://extranet.who.int/dhis2\" target=\"_blank\"><u>https://extranet.who.int/dhis2</u></a>).
