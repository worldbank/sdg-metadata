	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Concepts and definitions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definition:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value in percentage of weighted average tariffs applied to the imports of goods in HS chapter 01-97.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weighted average: In order to aggregate tariff value for country groups it is recommended to make use of a weighting methodology based on the value of goods imported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tariffs: Tariffs are customs duties on merchandise imports, levied either on an ad valorem basis (percentage of value) or on a specific basis (e.g. $7 per 100 kg). Tariffs can be used to create a price advantage for similar locally-produced goods and for raising government revenues. Trade remedy measures and taxes are not considered to be tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
