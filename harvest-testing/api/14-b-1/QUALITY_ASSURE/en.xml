	<message>The QUALITY_ASSURE field for indicator 14-b-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; Data are checked for their correctness; completeness; consistency along the process of data entry, and/or through a specific statistical analysis as the yearly data set is closed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; The indicator relies on data generated through the CCRF questionnaire which is filled in by countries on a biannual basis. To facilitate reporting of the CCRF-based SDG indicators, a tailor-made data processing tool has been developed within the framework of the existing CCRF questionnaire online platform. Upon submission of the questionnaire by the user, an indicator report will automatically be generated for final validation by the country.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
