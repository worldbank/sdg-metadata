	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data for this indicator exist for about 90 economies (in 2015). However, more countries are expected to provide information on this indicator over the next few years, which will allow ITU to produce regional and global estimates. Data on fixed-broadband subscriptions not broken down by speed are widely available, and regional and global are being produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since data for this indicator are based on administrative data from ISPs, no information on individual subscribers is available and therefore the data cannot be broken down by any individual characteristics. Data could in theory be broken down by geographic location and urban/rural, but ITU does not collect this information.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
