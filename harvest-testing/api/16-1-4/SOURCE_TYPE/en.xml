	<message>The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 16-1-4, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The indicator is based on a single survey question (&amp;#x2018;How safe do you feel walking alone in your area/neighbourhood at night?&amp;#x2019;) to be included in a general population survey. The question can be an add-on survey module to be incorporated into other ongoing general population surveys (such as surveys on corruption, governance, quality of life, public attitudes or surveys on other topics) or be part of dedicated surveys on crime victimisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data should be collected as part of a nationally representative probability sample of adult population residing in the country, irrespective of legal residence status. The sampling frame and sample design should ensure that results can be disaggregated at sub-national level. It is recommended that the sample size is sufficiently large to allow for disaggregation by age, gender, ethnicity, and other relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey documentation should provide the specific wording used to collect data on fear of crime/perceptions of safety, enable the identification of possible discrepancies from standard definitions, and allow an assessment of the overall data quality (e.g. sample size, target population, agency responsible for the data collection, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
