&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have a specific standardize form depending on the status of malaria control, elimination or prevention of reinfection. We perform internal validation for outliers and completeness and rise queries to countries through the regional offices for clarification. When necessary we rely on data quality assessment information from external sources such as partners working in malaria monitor and evaluation. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The World Malaria Report is sent to the countries via regional offices for consultation and approval.&lt;/li&gt;
