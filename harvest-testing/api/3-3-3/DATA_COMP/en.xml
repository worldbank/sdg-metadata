	<data>&lt;p&gt;Malaria incidence (1) is expressed as the number of new cases per 100,000 population per year with the population of a country derived from projections made by the UN Population Division and the total proportion at risk estimated by a country&amp;#x2019;s National Malaria Control Programme. More specifically, the country estimates what is the total proportion of the population at risk of malaria and then, for each year, the total population at risk is estimated as the UN Population for that year, times the proportion of the population at risk at baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total number of new cases, T, is estimated from the number of malaria cases reported by a Ministry of Health which is adjusted to take into account (i) incompleteness in reporting systems (ii) patients seeking treatment in the private sector, self-medicating or not seeking treatment at all, and (iii) potential over-diagnosis through the lack of laboratory confirmation of cases. The procedure, which is described in the &lt;em&gt;World malaria report 2009&lt;/em&gt; (2), combines data reported by NMCPs (reported cases, reporting completeness and likelihood that cases are parasite positive) with data obtained from nationally representative household surveys on health-service use. Briefly, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T=(a+(c &amp;#xD7; e)/d)&amp;#xD7;(1+h/g+((1&amp;#x2212;g&amp;#x2212;h)/2)/g)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where: &lt;br&gt;a is the number of malaria cases confirmed in public sector &lt;br&gt;b is the number of suspected cases tested &lt;br&gt;c is the number of presumed cases (not tested but treated as malaria) &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;d &lt;/em&gt;is the reporting completeness &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;e &lt;/em&gt;is the test positivity rate (malaria positive fraction) = a/b &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;f &lt;/em&gt;is the estimated cases in public sector, calculated by (a + (c x &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;))/&lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;g &lt;/em&gt;is the fraction seeking treatment in public sector &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;h &lt;/em&gt;is the fraction seeking treatment in private sector &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;i &lt;/em&gt;is the fraction not seeking treatment, calculated by (1-&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;-&lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;)/2 &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;j &lt;/em&gt;is the cases in private sector, calculated as &lt;em&gt;f x h/g&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;k &lt;/em&gt;is the cases not in private and not in public, calculated by &lt;em&gt;f &lt;/em&gt;x &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;T &lt;/em&gt;is total cases, calculated by &lt;em&gt;f &lt;/em&gt;+ &lt;em&gt;j &lt;/em&gt;+ &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To estimate the uncertainty around the number of cases, the test positivity rate was assumed to have a normal distribution centred on the &lt;em&gt;Test positivity rate&lt;/em&gt; value and standard deviation defined as &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0.244 &amp;#xD7; Test positivity rate&lt;sup&gt;0.5547&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; and truncated to be in the range 0, 1. Reporting completeness was assumed to have one of three distributions, depending on the range or value reported by the NMCP. If the range was greater than 80% the distribution was assumed to be triangular, with limits of 0.8 and 1 and the peak at 0.8. If the range was greater than 50% then the distribution was assumed to be rectangular, with limits of 0.5 and 0.8. Finally, if the range was lower than 50% the distribution was assumed to be triangular, with limits of 0 and 0.5 and the peak at 0.5 (3) . If the reporting completeness was reported as a value and was greater than 80%, a beta distribution was assumed with a mean value of the reported value (maximum of 95%) and confidence intervals (CIs) of 5% round the mean value. The proportions of children for whom care was sought in the private sector and in the public sector were assumed to have a beta distribution, with the mean value being the estimated value in the survey and the standard deviation calculated from the range of the estimated 95% confidence intervals (CI) divided by 4. The proportion of children for whom care was not sought was assumed to have a rectangular distribution, with the lower limit 0 and upper limit calculated as 1 minus the proportion that sought care in public or private sector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Values for the proportion seeking care were linearly interpolated between the years that have a survey, and were extrapolated for the years before the first or after the last survey. Missing values for the distributions were imputed using a mixture of the distribution of the country, with equal probability for the years where values were present or, if there was no value at all for any year in the country, a mixture of the distribution of the region for that year. The data were analysed using the R statistical software (4). Confidence intervals were obtained from 10000 drawns of the convoluted distributions. (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Botswana, Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Eritrea, Ethiopia, French Guiana, Gambia, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Lao People&amp;#x2019;s Democratic Republic, Madagascar, Mauritania, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Rwanda, Senegal, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Vanuatu, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam, Yemen and Zimbabwe. For India, the values were obtained at subnational level using the same methodology, but adjusting the private sector for an additional factor due to the active case detection, estimated as the ratio of the test positivity rate in the active case detection over the test positivity rate for the passive case detection. This factor was assumed to have a normal distribution, with mean value and standard deviation calculated from the values reported in 2010. Bangladesh, Bolivia (plurinational State of), Botswana, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Myanmar (since 2013), Rwanda, and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) report cases from the private and public sector together; therefore, no adjustment for private sector seeking treatment was made while for Indonesia, 25% of the private was assume to be reported in the public sector since 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some high-transmission African countries the quality of case reporting is considered insufficient for the above formulae to be applied. In such cases estimates of the number of malaria cases are derived from information on parasite prevalence obtained from household surveys. First, data on parasite prevalence from nearly 60 000 survey records were assembled within a spatiotemporal Bayesian geostatistical model, along with environmental and sociodemographic covariates, and data distribution on interventions such as ITNs, antimalarial drugs and IRS. The geospatial model enabled predictions of Plasmodium falciparum prevalence in children aged 2&amp;#x2013;10 years, at a resolution of 5 &amp;#xD7; 5 km2, throughout all malaria endemic African countries for each year from 2000 to 2016 (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.map.ox.ac.uk/making-maps/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;http://www.map.ox.ac.uk/making-maps/&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for methods on the development of maps by the Malaria Atlas Project). Second, an ensemble model was developed to predict malaria incidence as a function of parasite prevalence. The model was then applied to the estimated parasite prevalence in order to obtain estimates of the malaria case incidence at 5 &amp;#xD7; 5 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; resolution for each year from 2000 to 2016. Data for each 5 &amp;#xD7; 5 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area were then aggregated within country and regional boundaries to obtain both national and regional estimates of malaria cases (5). (Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, C&amp;#xF4;te d&amp;apos;Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Togo, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of the elimination or near elimination countries, the number of indigenous cases registered by the NMCPs are reported without further adjustments. (Algeria, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belize, Bhutan, Cabo Verde, China, Comoros, Costa Rica, Democratic People&amp;#x2019;s Republic of Korea, Djibouti, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Eswatini, Georgia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Oman, Paraguay, Republic of Korea, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, Turkey, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan). &lt;/p&gt;</data>
