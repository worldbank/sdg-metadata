	<data>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rationale&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To measure trends in malaria morbidity and to identify locations where the risk of disease is highest. With this information, programmes can respond to unusual trends, such as epidemics, and direct resources to the populations most in need. This data also serves to inform global resource allocation for malaria such as when defining eligibility criteria for Global Fund finance.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
