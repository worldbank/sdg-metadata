&lt;p&gt;Cases reported by the NMCP are obtained from each country surveillance system. This include among others information on the number of suspected cases, number of tested cases, number of positive cases by method of detection and by species as well as number of health facilities that report those cases. This information is summarized in a DHIS2 application developed for this purpose. Data for representative household surveys are publicly available and included National Demographic Household Surveys (DHS) or Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
