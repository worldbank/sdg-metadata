	<message>The REG_AGG field for indicator 15-1-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regional aggregates:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNEP-WCMC is the agency in charge of calculating and reporting global and regional figures for this indicator, working with BirdLife International and IUCN to combine data on protected areas with those for sites of importance for biodiversity. UNEP-WCMC aggregates the global and regional figures on protected areas from the national figures that are calculated from the World Database on Protected Areas and disseminated through Protected Planet. The World Database on Protected Areas and Protected Planet are jointly managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas. The World Database on Protected Areas is held within a Geographic Information System that stores information about protected areas such as their name, size, type, date of establishment, geographic location (point) and/or boundary (polygon). Protected area coverage is calculated using all the protected areas recorded in World Database on Protected Areas whose location and extent is known apart from protected areas without digital boundaries and those sites who have a status of &amp;#x2018;proposed&amp;#x2019; or &amp;#x2018;not reported&amp;#x2019;.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
