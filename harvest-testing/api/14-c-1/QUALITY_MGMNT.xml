			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Data on ratification of and accession to UNCLOS and its two implementing agreements is available, and may be verified. OLA/DOALOS will verify data on ratification of and accession to UNCLOS and its two implementing agreements submitted by countries, in light of information available to Secretary-General as the depositary for those instruments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNCLOS and UNFSA do not provide for a secretariat. OLA/DOALOS performs the role of secretariat for these instruments &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt;. It has received no mandate from the General Assembly to review or assess the status of implementation of these instruments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondent countries will be invited to assess the level of implementation and share relevant information regarding the implementation of UNCLOS and its implementing agreements in their responses to the questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;
