{"status":"success","message":"The QUALITY_ASSURE field for indicator 9-5-2, translated into en","data":"<h2>Quality assurance:</h2>\n<p>The UNESCO Institute of Statistics (UIS) sends out a questionnaire every year to collect R&amp;D data from all countries (around 125 countries), which are not covered by the data collections of the other partner organizations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Eurostat (Statistical Office of the European Union) and the Network on Science and Technology Indicators &#x2013; Ibero-American and Inter-American (RICYT). In agreement with these three organisations, their data (which were collected from their member states/associated member states &#x2013; around 65 countries-) are directly obtained from the respective databases (in the case of the OECD and Eurostat) or received from the partner (in the case of RICYT). There is also collaboration in Africa with the African STI Indicators Initiative (ASTII) of AU/NEPAD. For the data UIS sends a questionnaire to, the quality assurance process is the following: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A questionnaire is sent to focal points in countries, generally within the Ministry of Science and Technology or the national statistical office. </li>\n  <li>UIS processes the questionnaires, communicating with the countries in case of questions, calculates indicators and releases the data and indicators on its website. </li>\n  <li>Countries are requested to complete the questionnaire using the standard international classifications, therefore adjustments are generally not needed. The other agencies have similar procedures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After processing the data, but before submitting the data for inclusion in the SDG database, UIS sends the calculated indicators for target 9.5 to all countries that do not submit their data to Eurostat or the OECD. This provides the countries with the opportunity to review the data and provide any modifications or additions before UIS submits the data to UNSD.</p>"}
