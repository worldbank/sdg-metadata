{"status":"success","message":"The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 15-1-1, translated into en","data":"<h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>\n<p>The national figures in the database are reported by the countries themselves following standardized format, definitions and reporting years, thus eliminating any discrepancies between global and national figures. The reporting template requests that countries provide the full reference for original data sources as well as national definitions and terminology. Separate sections in the template country reports deal with the analysis of data (including any assumptions made and the methods used for estimates and projections to the common reporting years); calibration of data to the official land area as held by FAO; and reclassification of data to the classes used in FAO&#x2019;s Global Forest Resources Assessments.</p>"}
