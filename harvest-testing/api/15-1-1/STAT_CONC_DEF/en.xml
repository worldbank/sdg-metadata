	<message>The STAT_CONC_DEF field for indicator 15-1-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forest area as a proportion of total land area&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concepts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To provide a precise definition of the indicator, it is crucial to provide a definition of its two components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;Forest&amp;#x201D; and &amp;#x201C;Land Area&amp;#x201D;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the FAO, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Forest&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is defined as: &amp;#x201C;land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use&amp;#x201D;. More specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of other predominant land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 meters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It includes areas with young trees that have not yet reached but which are expected to reach a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of 5 meters or more. It also includes areas that are temporarily unstocked due to clear-cutting as part of a forest management practice or natural disasters, and which are expected to be regenerated within 5 years. Local conditions may, in exceptional cases, justify that a longer time frame is used.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those of specific environmental, scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It includes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectares and width of more than 20 meters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It includes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of trees that have, or are expected to reach, a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of at least 5 meters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It includes areas with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless of whether this area is classified as land area or not.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It includes rubberwood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height and canopy cover criteria are met.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive orchards and agroforestry systems when crops are grown under tree cover. Note: Some agroforestry systems such as the &amp;#x201C;Taungya&amp;#x201D; system where crops are grown only during the first years of the forest rotation should be classified as forest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Land area&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is the country area excluding area under inland waters and coastal waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Country area&lt;/strong&gt;: Area under national sovereignty. It is the sum of land area, inland waters and coastal waters. It excludes the exclusive economic zone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inland waters&lt;/strong&gt;: Areas corresponding to natural or artificial water courses, serving to drain natural or artificial bodies of water, including lakes, reservoirs, rivers, brooks, streams, ponds, inland canals, dams, and other land-locked waters. The banks constitute limits whether the water is present or not.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coastal waters&lt;/strong&gt;: Waters located in-between the land territory and the outer limit of the territorial sea. They comprise &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Internal waters&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Territorial sea,&amp;quot; and where applicable, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Archipelagic waters.&amp;quot; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</data>
