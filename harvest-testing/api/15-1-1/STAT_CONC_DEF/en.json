It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use&#x201D;. More specifically:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Forest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of other predominant land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 meters.</li>\n  <li>It includes areas with young trees that have not yet reached but which are expected to reach a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of 5 meters or more. It also includes areas that are temporarily unstocked due to clear-cutting as part of a forest management practice or natural disasters, and which are expected to be regenerated within 5 years. Local conditions may, in exceptional cases, justify that a longer time frame is used.</li>\n  <li>It includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those of specific environmental, scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest.</li>\n  <li>It includes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectares and width of more than 20 meters.</li>\n  <li>It includes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of trees that have, or are expected to reach, a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of at least 5 meters.</li>\n  <li>It includes areas with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless whether this area is classified as land area or not.</li>\n  <li>It includes rubberwood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations.</li>\n  <li>It includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height and canopy cover criteria are met.</li>\n  <li>It excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive orchards and agroforestry systems when crops are grown under tree cover. Note: Some agroforestry systems such as the &#x201C;Taungya&#x201D; system where crops are grown only during the first years of the forest rotation should be classified as forest.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Total land area is the total surface area of a country less the area covered by inland waters, like major rivers and lakes. </p>\n<p>The indicator is expressed as percent.</p>"}
