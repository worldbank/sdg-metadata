&lt;p&gt;Assessment of forest area is carried out at infrequent intervals in many countries. Although the improved access to remote sensing data can help some countries to update their forest area estimates more frequently, estimation of forest area using remote sensing techniques for has certain challenges. In particular they relate to the assessment of land use (remote sensing primarily assesses land cover), and gradual changes, such as forest regrowth, that can require several years to become detectable. In addition, forest area with low canopy cover density (e.g. 10-30%) are still difficult to detect at large scale with affordable remote sensing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
