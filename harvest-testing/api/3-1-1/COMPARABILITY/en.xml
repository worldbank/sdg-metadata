	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maternal mortality ratio is defined as the number of maternal deaths divided by live births. However, to account for potential incompleteness of death recording in various data sources, the MMEIG first computes the fraction of deaths due to maternal causes from original data sources (referred to as the &amp;#x201C;proportion maternal&amp;#x201D;, or PM), and then applies that fraction to WHO estimates of total deaths among women of reproductive age to obtain an estimate of the number of maternal deaths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the following fraction is first computed from country data sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PM= Number of maternal deaths 15-49/All female deaths at ages 15-49 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then the PM is used to compute the MMR as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MMR=PM &amp;#xD7; (All female deaths at ages 15-49/Number of live births)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where the estimate of all deaths at ages 15-49 in the second equation is derived from WHO life tables, and the number of live births is from the World Population Prospects 201.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this as background, a few reasons that MMEIG estimates may differ from national statistics are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Civil registration and vital statistics systems are not always complete (i.e., they do not always capture 100% of all deaths) and completeness may change over time. The MMEIG estimation approach attempts to correct for this by using the above approach, which involves first computing the PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The MMEIG often applies adjustment factors to the PM computed from original data to account for measurement issues (such as how the country defined &amp;#x201C;maternal&amp;#x201D; deaths; misclassification; or incompleteness). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The MMEIG uses the standardized series of live births from the United Nations Population Division, as published in World Population Prospects 2019, in the denominator of the MMR equation. To better inform the WPP, countries should discuss discrepancies directly with the UNPD. The contact address is population@un.org; this email address is monitored regularly, and messages are dispatched to the appropriate analysts for each country or concern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Statistically speaking, maternal deaths are a relatively rare event, which can lead to noisy time trends in data over time. As the goal of the MMEIG estimates is to track long term progress in reducing maternal mortality, the estimation process involves some smoothing to generate a curve that better captures changes in underlying risk.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
