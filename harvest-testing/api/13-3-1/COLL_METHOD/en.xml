	<data>&lt;p&gt;Responses are submitted by national governments, typically by officials in Ministries of Education. Respondents are asked to consult widely across other government ministries, with national human rights institutes, the education sector and civil society organizations in compiling their responses. Respondents are also asked to submit supporting evidence in the form of documents or links (e.g. to education policies or laws, curricula, etc.), which will be made publicly available at the end of the reporting cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
