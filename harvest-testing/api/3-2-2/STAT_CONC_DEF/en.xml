&lt;h2&gt;Definition:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neonatal mortality rate is the probability that a child born in a specific year or period will die during the first 28 completed days of life if subject to age-specific mortality rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live births.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neonatal deaths (deaths among live births during the first 28 completed days of life) may be subdivided into early neonatal deaths, occurring during the first 7 days of life, and late neonatal deaths, occurring after the 7th day but before the 28th completed day of life.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
