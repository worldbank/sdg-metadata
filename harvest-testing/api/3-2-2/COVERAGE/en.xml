	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicator is available for all countries from 1990 (or earlier) to 2018, depending on availability of empirical data for each country before 1990.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common disaggregation for mortality indicators includes disaggregation by sex, age (neonatal, infant, child), wealth quintile, residence, and mother&amp;#x2019;s education. Disaggregated data are not always available. Disaggregation by geographic location is usually at the regional level, or the minimum provincial level for survey or census data. Data from well-functioning vital registration systems can provide further geographical breakdowns.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
