	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Rationale:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortality rates among young children are a key output indicator for child health and well-being, and, more broadly, for social and economic development. It is a closely watched public health indicator because it reflects the access of children and communities to basic health interventions such as vaccination, medical treatment of infectious diseases and adequate nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
