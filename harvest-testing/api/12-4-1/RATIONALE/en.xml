	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 12-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Rationale:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed indicator is process-oriented, focusing on compliance with the obligations that contribute to the overall target of achieving the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#x2019;t measure the quantity of chemicals in media and doesn&amp;#x2019;t quantify adverse impacts on human health and the environment. The MEAs, however, were developed and adopted to address the most urgent challenges for human health and the environment and therefore, through the implementation of MEAs progress will be made to reduce release to air, water and soil and well as presence of hazardous chemicals in products. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
