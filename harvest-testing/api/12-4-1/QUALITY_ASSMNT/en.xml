	<data>&lt;p&gt;For the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions, information transmitted by Parties to the Secretariat is made available to the Conference of the Parties for monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Minamata Convention, the Secretariat can report very high reporting rates: 80% of Parties have submitted complete reports (data is available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mercuryconvention.org/Countries/Parties/Reporting/tabid/8189/language/en-US/Default.aspx&quot;&gt;https://www.mercuryconvention.org/Countries/Parties/Reporting/tabid/8189/language/en-US/Default.aspx&lt;/a&gt;) The Secretariat can also report that 80% of Parties have designated national focal points in a timely and appropriate manner (a list of designations is available at https://www.mercuryconvention.org/Countries/Parties/Notifications/tabid/3826/language/en-US/Default.aspx)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Montreal Protocol, the responsibility for the overall evaluation of fulfilling quality of the submitted data lies with the parties. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
