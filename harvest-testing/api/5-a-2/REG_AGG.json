This may result in users interpreting these aggregates as pertaining to all countries in the region, which is the equivalent of treating countries with missing data as if they were the same as those for which data are available.</p>\n<p>In the first expected reporting period, which is 2020, we will only have one data point per country. In the first reporting period, we can only measure and report the shares of countries in each of the 6 bands as well as the share of countries which have not reported yet. This first reporting period will also serve as the baseline against which future progress will be measured.</p>\n<h2>Obtaining internationally comparable data for global monitoring:</h2>\n<p>As noted above delegated national institutions will be responsible for undertaking the legal assessment at the national level. It is recommended that the results of the final assessment are shared widely and validated by a cross-section of relevant institutions prior to final submission to FAO.</p>\n<p>Both the national legal expert(s) and institutions carrying out the assessment and the FAO Gender and Land Rights team will follow the detailed Guidelines in assessing whether the proxy is present or not present in the legal framework. The detailed Guidelines are a mechanism to ensure the robustness and comparability of the data collected at the national level, and to ensure that like situations are treated like. The initial legal research for developing the methodology and its piloting process in different regions/contexts were invaluable in delineating the threshold of each proxy and ensuring that countries are treated equitably under the methodology in terms of the different ways in which the proxies may appear in national legislation. A good example of this is proxy B, spousal consent for land transactions, under which the Guidelines provide outline which type of legal provisions meet the proxy threshold with specific reference to the three different marital regimes &#x2013; separate, partial community or community property. Similarly, the methodology provides clear guidance on how to treat legal regimes that do not provide for private ownership &#x2013; by providing examples of what type of &#x2018;ownership&#x2019; would equate the equivalent to a freehold estate under systems where all land is owned by the state. </p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
