	<message>The STAT_CONC_DEF field for indicator 5-a-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Definition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicator 5.a.2 looks at the extent to which the legal framework (including customary law) guarantees women&amp;#x2019;s equal rights to land ownership and/or control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator &amp;#x201C;measures&amp;#x201D; the level to which a country&amp;#x2019;s legal framework supports women&amp;#x2019;s land rights, by testing that framework against six proxies drawn from international law and internationally accepted good practices , in particular the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) ratified by 189 countries, and the Voluntary Guidelines for the Responsible Governance of the Tenure of Land Fisheries and Forestry (VGGT) endorsed unanimously by Committee of Food Security (CFS) members in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six proxies through which indicator 5.a.2 is monitored are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proxy A: Joint registration of land compulsory or encouraged through economic incentives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proxy B: Compulsory spousal consent for land transactions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proxy C: Women&amp;#x2019;s and girls&amp;#x2019; equal inheritance rights&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proxy D: Allocation of financial resources to increase women&amp;#x2019;s ownership and control over land&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proxy E: In legal systems that recognise customary land tenure, existence of explicit protection of the land rights of women&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proxy F: Mandatory quotas for women&amp;#x2019;s participation in land management and administration institutions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concepts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator tracks progress on legal reforms that guarantee women&amp;#x2019;s land rights (including customary) in terms of ownership and/or control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator refers to customary law. The inclusion of the customary dimension in the indicator is very important because in many contexts in which these systems prevail, women&amp;#x2019;s land rights tend to be denied or insecure. However, the enormous diversity of customs and social norms that govern customary land among countries and their unwritten nature, create a significant challenge for assessing whether the proxies are present in these systems. To solve this issue, it is proposed that the customary dimension will be considered only when the formal legal framework recognizes customary land tenure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the indicator refers to ownership and/or control of land which are two critical but different dimensions regarding women&amp;#x2019;s land rights. Land ownership refers to the legally recognised right to acquire, to use and to transfer landed property, while the control over land is associated with the ability to make decisions over land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key definitions are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Land: Land is defined as all immovable property &amp;#x2013; for instance the house, the land upon which a house is built and land which is used for other purposes, such as agricultural production. It also encompasses any other structures built on land to meet permanent purposes. Legal frameworks commonly use the terms &amp;#x2018;immovable property&amp;#x2019; or &amp;#x2018;real property&amp;#x2019; when referring to land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Land ownership: Land ownership is a legally recognised right to acquire, to use and to transfer land. In private property systems, this is a right akin to a freehold tenure. In systems where land is owned by the state, the term land ownership refers to possession of the rights most akin to ownership in a private property system &amp;#x2013; for instance, long-term leases, occupancy, tenancy or use rights granted by the state that are transferrable and are granted to users for several decades (for instance 99 years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control over land: Control over land is the ability to make decisions over land. It may include rights to make decisions about how the land should be used, including what crops should be planted, and to benefit financially from the sale of crops, including what crops should be planted, and to benefit financially from the sale of crops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customary land tenure: Customary land tenure is defined as the bodies of rules and institutions governing the way land and natural resources are held, managed, used and transacted within customary legal systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customary legal systems: Customary legal systems are systems that exist at the local or community level, that have not been set up by the state, and that derive their legitimacy from the values and traditions of the indigenous or local group. Customary legal systems may or may not be recognized by national law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal and policy framework: The legal and policy framework encompasses the Constitution, policy, primary legislation and secondary legislation. The legal and policy framework includes customary legal systems where they have been recognised by statutory law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal laws: Personal law is defined as a set of codified rules and norms applying to a group of people sharing a common religious faith with regard to personal matters. These laws usually cover family relations, marriage, and inheritance. The term can be used interchangeably with &amp;#x2018;religious laws&amp;#x2019;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary legislation: Primary legislation refers to (i) acts or statutes that have been formally adopted at national level following the official parliamentary procedure for the passage of laws (in parliamentary systems); (ii) other acts at the national level with the force of law, such as decree-laws and legislative decrees and otherwise (in parliamentary systems); (iii) other legal instruments that have that have been formally endorsed by a law-making body, for instance presidential and royal orders or presidential and royal decrees (in non-parliamentary systems or systems where law-making power lies in an additional institution to the parliament). In all cases, primary legislation must have the force of law, be binding. For the purposes of this assessment primary legislation also includes the Constitution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary legislation: Secondary legislation includes subsidiary, delegated or subordinate legal instruments that have the force of law, are binding and shall not be in contradiction with primary legislation. They are usually passed by the executive, such as national regulations, rules, by-laws, determinations, directions, circulars, orders, and implementing decrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joint registration: Joint registration is where the names of both spouses or both partners in an unmarried couple, are entered into the land registry as the owners or principal users of the land being registered. Joint registration signifies a form of shared tenure over the land &amp;#x2013; usually either a joint tenancy/occupancy or a tenancy in common). In legal systems which include a framework for land titling, joint registration is commonly referred to as joint titling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unmarried couples: Unmarried couples are defined as couples who live together (cohabit) in an intimate relationship, but who are not married in accordance with the marriage law of the country. Often this will refer to couples who were married under custom or religious laws, where such marriages are not recognised or do not comply with the requirements of the formal law. It may also refer to relationships that are recognised by the state but that are not considered a marriage &amp;#x2013; for instance a civil partnership and a de facto relationship that is registered with the state. The term &amp;#x2018;unmarried couples&amp;#x2019; is often used interchangeably with &amp;#x2018;de facto unions&amp;#x2019;, &amp;#x2018;consensual unions&amp;#x2019; or &amp;#x2018;irregular unions&amp;#x2019;. The members of an unmarried couple are referred to as &amp;#x2018;partners&amp;#x2019;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Land transactions: Land transactions for the purpose of the methodology are major land transactions, specifically the sale and encumbrance (mortgage) of land. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inheritance: Inheritance is defined as property passing at the owner&amp;apos;s death to the heir or those entitled to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deceased&amp;#x2019;s estate: The deceased&amp;#x2019;s estate encompasses the legal rights, interests and entitlements, to property of any kind (not only land) which the deceased spouse or partner enjoyed at the time of death, less any liabilities. Depending on the legal system, marital property may be excluded fully from the calculation of deceased&amp;#x2019;s estate, or, the deceased&amp;#x2019;s 50% share in the marital property will be included. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equal inheritance rights for sons and daughters: Equal inheritance rights for sons and daughters refer to the situation when the lines of succession in the legal and policy framework governing inheritance states equality of rank and shares between brothers and sisters or between daughters and sons, or are gender neutral.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
