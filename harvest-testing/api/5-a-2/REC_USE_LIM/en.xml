	<data>&lt;p&gt;Customary law. Indicator 5.a.2 entails an important challenge in terms of the assessment and computation of the results due to the reference to customary law in the title of the indicator. Customary law is not a homogenous system of law. Therefore, unless it is recognised by the general legal system, it will be extremely difficult to monitor whether or not customary law guarantees men and women equal rights to land ownership and(/or) control. In order to guarantee feasibility of the assessment, the choice of the methodology has been to monitor customary law to the extent that it has been recognised in the legal framework of a country. This however is a major limitation for the purposes of the SDGs of &amp;#x201C;leaving no one behind&amp;#x2019; as it excludes from the assessment many legal systems where customary practices which have not been endorsed in statutory law which are one of the major factors of discrimination against women. Further, given that customary law does not exist in all countries, it is not universally applicable and computation of the results represents a major challenge. The methodology has addressed this issue by creating a dual system of computation of the results which allows to assess separately those systems where customary law has been recognized, and those where no recognition of customary law is present. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geographical scope. The data collected for the SDG indicators is collected at the national level to ensure that it is representative of the country situation. This means that the 5.a.2 assessment to determine the existence of the proxies should focus on legal and policy instruments that have nationwide authority. In countries where law-making power for land or gender matters are not within the authority of the national government (or are shared between the national government and a sub-national government level), there may be a number of different state/provincial or county laws and policy that can be analysed. Further there may be inconsistencies between these different sub-national laws in terms of the presence of a proxy and the degree of its integration in the legal and policy framework. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where this is the case, the assessment should be conducted in as many states or counties needed to cover at least 50 percent of the total country&amp;#x2019;s population. Therefore, the proxy should be located in all of the legal and policy frameworks relevant to these locations. If it is not the case, the proxy is not present.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
