&lt;p&gt;Although data availability is ensured and all UN countries are expected to report, this might not be the case. Different countries may report at different times and a non-negligible share of countries may choose not to report on the indicator at all during the reporting period creating missing values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The missing values will be treated in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) For countries, which have reported in only 1 period, FAO does not have information on whether they are making progress on the indicator. However, FAO can take a few steps to alleviate the problem with missing values. First, FAO can assume that there was no progress on the indicator over the reporting periods. This can be easily determined by looking at the submitted questionnaire for identifying the date of adoption of the relevant instruments (laws). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) The only way to include countries that will never report is to cluster them in a category of missing information. This is because no assumption can be done regarding the status of each country&amp;#x2019;s laws. However, it is important to keep track of the countries which do not report rather than limit the analysis to the reporting countries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; At regional and global levels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regional and global aggregates will be based solely on those countries for which data are available, but at no point countries with missing data will be treated as if they were the same as those for which data are available. The global or regional aggregates would be valid for the reporting countries but not necessarily for the region as whole or at the global level as a whole. Missing values for individual countries or areas cannot be imputed or estimated to derive regional or global aggregates of the indicator because no assumption can be done regarding the status of each country&amp;#x2019;s laws&lt;/p&gt;
