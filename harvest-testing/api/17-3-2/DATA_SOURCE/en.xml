	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data providers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The national data provider of personal remittances is the institution in charge of the collection and compilation of the Balance of Payments statistics. This responsibility varies and is country specific (i.e. Central Bank). World Bank staff estimates for personal remittances data are used for gap-filling purposes. Personal remittances data are not reported directly to the World Bank from the national data provider. They are reported to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is the institution in charge of overseeing balance of payment stability as part of its institutional mandate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GDP data are sourced from the World Bank&amp;#x2019;s World Development Indicators (WDI) database and are compiled in accordance to the &lt;em&gt;System of National Accounts, 2008&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;2008 SNA&lt;/em&gt;) methodology. GDP data collection is conducted through the Unified Survey process, the World Bank&amp;#x2019;s principal mechanism for gathering quantitative macroeconomic information on its member countries.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
