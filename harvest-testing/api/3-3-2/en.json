The system includes real-time checks for data consistency. Estimates of TB burden are prepared in July-August and communicated with countries. In selected countries with new survey data, estimates are updated separately during the year. All estimates are communicated in August-September and revisions are done based on feedback. The final set of estimates is reviewed in WHO before publication in October, for compliance with specific international standards and harmonization of breakdowns for age and sex groups.</p><h1>Calendar</h1>\n<h2>Data collection:</h2>\n<p>current: March-June each year</p><h2>Data release:</h2>\n<p>October each year</p><h1>Data providers</h1>\n<p>National TB Programmes, Ministries of Health</p><h1>Data compilers</h1>\n<p>WHO</p><h2>Rationale:</h2>\n<p>Following two years of consultations, a new post-2015 global tuberculosis strategy was endorsed by the World Health Assembly in May 2014. Known as the End TB Strategy, it covers the period 2016-2035. The overall goal is to &#x201C;End the global tuberculosis epidemic&#x201D;, and correspondingly ambitious targets for reductions in tuberculosis deaths and cases are set for 2030 (80% reduction in incidence rate compared with the level of 2015) and 2035 (90% reduction in incidence rate), in the context of the SDGs. </p>\n<p>The tuberculosis incidence rate was selected as an indicator for measuring reductions in the number of cases of disease burden. Although this indicator was estimated with considerable uncertainty in most countries in 2014, notifications of cases to national authorities provide a good proxy if there is limited under-reporting of detected cases and limited under or over-diagnosis of cases.</p><h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n<p>TB incidence has been used for over a century as a main indicator of TB burden, along with TB mortality. The indicator allows comparisons over time and between countries. Improvement in the quality of TB surveillance data result in reduced uncertainty about indicator values.</p><h1>Methodology</h1>\n<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n<p>Estimates of TB incidence are produced through a consultative and analytical process led by WHO and are published annually. These estimates are based on annual case notifications, assessments of the quality and coverage of TB notification data, national surveys of the prevalence of TB disease and information from death (vital) registration systems.</p>\n<p>Estimates of incidence for each country are derived, using one or more of the following approaches depending on available data: (i) incidence = case notifications/estimated proportion of cases detected; (ii) capture-recapture modelling, (iii) incidence = prevalence/duration of condition.</p>\n<p>Uncertainty bounds are provided in addition to best estimates.</p>\n<p>Details are available from TB impact measurement: policy and recommendations for how to assess the epidemiological burden of TB and the impact of TB control and from the online technical appendix to the WHO global tuberculosis report 2017 and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00278\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00278</a></p><h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Details available in the following publicly available paper:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1603/1603.00278.pdf\">https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1603/1603.00278.pdf</a></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>At regional and global levels:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Details available in the following publicly available paper:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1603/1603.00278.pdf\">https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1603/1603.00278.pdf</a></p><h2>Regional aggregates:</h2>\n<p>Country estimates of case counts are aggregated.
