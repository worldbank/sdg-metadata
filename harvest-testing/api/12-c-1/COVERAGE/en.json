{"status":"success","message":"The COVERAGE field for indicator 12-c-1, translated into en","data":"<h1>Data availability</h1>\n<h2>Description:</h2>\n<p>An initial baseline data assessment of data availability demonstrates that 99 countries have existing data which can be used to estimate fossil fuels from direct transfer and many of these countries also have information on tax revenue foregone. Data on induced transfers using a price gap approach is available for all UN member states.</p>\n<h2>Time series:</h2>\n<p>The reporting on this indicator will follow an annual cycle with initial reporting on induced transfers starting in 2018. Data on direct transfers and tax revenue foregone will be in place by 2020.</p>\n<h2>Disaggregation:</h2>\n<p>Because of the risk of double counting, the dataset should therefore provide disaggregated information on individual subsidy measures that will be reported as sub-indicators by category of subsidies.</p>"}
