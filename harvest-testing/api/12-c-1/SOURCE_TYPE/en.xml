&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct transfers are generally reported in government budgets, and well documented in sectoral and Finance Ministries, broken down by programme if not by fuel. Those that meet the SNA definition of &amp;#x201C;subsidies&amp;#x201D; &amp;#x2013; i.e., subsidies on products, and other subsidies on production &amp;#x2013; can also be found in a country&amp;#x2019;s System of National Accounts. Budget documents are publicly available for most countries. The degree to which information on individual programmes is itemized in those reports is highly variable, however. Support to corporations involved in energy production or transformation may sometimes be found in their annual reports, for example. In some cases, researchers may be able to obtain unpublished data from state-owned energy enterprises directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Induced transfer are measured by calculating the price-gap between the producer or consumer price and a reference price, and multiplying that differential by the affected volume produced or consumed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measuring the value of special features introduced into the tax code to favour certain industries or activities of those industries (such as investment in productive capital) can be a complex endeavour. Some countries do this exercise already, and report the annual value of those tax features in their periodic tax-expenditure reports. Where that is not the case, the analysist must construct a model and estimate the difference in the revenues that would be owed to the government under the baseline conditions and with the special tax feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fossil fuel subsidies should be monitored on an annual basis. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
