&lt;p&gt;The indicator refers to the number of parties (=countries that have ratified, accepted, approved or accessed), to the following Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal (Basel Convention); &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Rotterdam Convention on the prior informed consent procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade (Rotterdam Convention);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (Stockholm Convention);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (Montreal Protocol);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Minamata Convention on Mercury (Minamata Convention),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which have submitted the information to the Secretariat of each MEA, as required by each of the agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information required is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Basel Convention&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-2&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Designation of the Focal Point and one or more Competent Authorities;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Submission of the annual national reports.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compliance with annual reporting requirements for production and consumption of controlled substances under Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Submission of information on Licensing systems under (Article 4B of) the Montreal Protocol&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For each party, a percentage value is assigned to indicate how much of the required information has been submitted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Minamata Convention:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Submission of national reports as required under Article 21 of the Minamata Convention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concepts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parties: countries that have ratified, accepted, approved or accessed a convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information: Parties to the Basel Convention have an obligation to present an annual national report as provided for by Article 13, paragraph 3 in order to enable monitoring of the implementation of the Basel Convention by its Parties. The reports are to contain, inter alia, Information regarding transboundary movements of hazardous wastes or other wastes in which Parties have been involved, including the amount of hazardous wastes and other wastes exported, their category, characteristics, destination, any transit country and disposal method as stated on the response to notification, the amount of hazardous wastes and other wastes imported their category, characteristics, origin, and disposal methods; information on accidents occurring during the transboundary movement and disposal of hazardous wastes and other wastes and on the measures undertaken to deal with them; information on disposal options operated within the area of their national jurisdiction; and other information as per reporting format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Import responses under the Rotterdam Convention are the decisions provided by Parties indicating whether or not they will consent to import the chemicals listed in Annex III of the Convention and subject to the prior informed consent (PIC) procedure. Article 10 of the Rotterdam Convention sets out the obligations of Parties with respect to the future import of chemicals listed in Annex III.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Stockholm Convention a Party has an obligation to report on the measures it has taken to implement the provisions of the Convention and on the effectiveness of such measures in meeting the objectives of the Convention. The national reports include statistical data on the total quantities of production, import and export of each of the chemicals listed in Annex A and Annex B or a reasonable estimate of such data; and to the extent practicable, a list of the States from which it has imported each such substance and the States to which it has exported each such substance. A National Implementation Plan under the Stockholm Convention is a plan explaining how a Party is going to implement the obligations under the Convention and make efforts to put such a plan into operation (&lt;a href=&quot;http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/Repository/conf/UNEP-POPS-CONF-4-AppendixII.5206ab9e-ca67-42a7-afee-9d90720553c8.pdf#Article%207&quot;&gt;Article 7&lt;/a&gt;). Changes in the obligations arising from amendments to the Convention or its annexes, for example when a new chemical is listed into the annexes of the Convention, a Party will review and update its implementation plan, and transmit the updated plan to the Conference of the Parties within two years of the entry into force of the amendment for it, consistent with paragraph 1 (b) of the Convention (according to paragraph 7 of the annex to decision SC-1/12). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minamata Convention requires, under its article 17, paragraph 4, that each Party designates a National Focal Point for the exchange of information under it, including with regard to the consent of importing Parties under Article 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pursuant to Article 21 of the Minamata Convention on Mercury, each party to the Convention shall report to the Conference of the Parties on the measures it has taken to implement the provisions of the Convention, on the effectiveness of such measures and on possible challenges in meeting the objectives of the Convention. In decision MC-1/8 on the Timing and format of reporting by the Parties, the Conference of the Parties at its first meeting (2017) agreed on the full format of reporting and decided that each Party shall report every four years using the full format and report every two years on four questions marked by an asterisk in the full format. The Conference of the Parties further decided on the following timing with regards to the short and full reporting: 31 December 2019 as the deadline for first biennial short report; 31 December 2021 as the deadline for first full report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Montreal Protocol requires, under its Article 7, that each Party provides to the Secretariat for each controlled substance statistical data on its annual production, amounts used for feedstocks, amounts destroyed by technologies approved by the Parties, imports from and exports to Parties and non-Parties respectively and amount of the controlled substance listed in Annex E used for quarantine and pre-shipment applications, for the year during which provisions concerning those substances entered into force for that Party and for each year thereafter. Each Party shall also provide to the Secretariat statistical data on its annual emissions of HFC-23 per facility. The calculation of control levels is provided in Article 3 of the Protocol. This reporting enables monitoring of the implementation of the Protocol, and compliance with the control measures under the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, under Article 4B, each party is required to establish and implement a system for licensing the import and export of new, used, recycled and reclaimed controlled substances. Each Party is required, within three months of the date of introducing its licensing system, to report to the Secretariat on the establishment and operation of that system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-2&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt; The parameters presented below are based on the obligations of the Parties to transmit information to the Secretariat, whatever its national circumstances. Other information that only needs to be communicated to the Secretariat based on national circumstances, such as a possible national definitions of hazardous wastes, possible article 11 agreements under the Basel Convention, or a possible exemptions under the Stockholm Convention would not be included, either because the Secretariat is not in a position to assess whether the obligation to transmit information has materialized itself, or because Parties have the right not to make use of a right. &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;strong&gt;Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions&lt;/strong&gt; the units of measurements are the transmission of information, such as the number of country contacts designated, number of national reports, national implementation plans and import responses. For each party, a percentage value is assigned to indicate how much of the required information has been submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Minamata Convention the units of measurement are the number of designated national focal points and the number of national reports received. For each party, a percentage value is assigned to indicate how much of the required information has been submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Montreal Protocol the units of measurement are the number of parties that comply with their reporting obligations with regard to production and consumption of controlled substances (Article 7) and submission of information on licensing systems (Article 4B). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each party, a percentage value is assigned to indicate how much of the required information has been submitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Basel Convention: national focal points, electronic reporting system for annual national reports;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rotterdam Convention: official contact points and designated national authorities, PIC circular for import responses;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stockholm Convention: official contact points; electronic reporting system for national reports every four years, National Implementation Plans;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Montreal Protocol: national focal points;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Minamata Convention: national focal points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data is collected by the Secretariat of the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions from Focal Points for the Basel Conventions, official contact points and designated national authorities for the Rotterdam Convention, official contact points for the Stockholm Convention, by the Ozone Secretariat from national focal points for the Montreal Protocol, and by the Secretariat of the Minamata Convention from national focal points for the Minamata Convention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First reporting cycle: 2017;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Second reporting cycle: 2020;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Third reporting cycle: 2025;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fourth reporting cycle: 2030.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First reporting cycle: 2010-2014;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Second reporting cycle: 2015-2019;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Third reporting cycle: 2020-2024;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fourth reporting cycle: 2025-2029.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focal Points and Competent Authorities for the Basel Conventions (188 Parties);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Designated National Authorities and Official contact points for the Rotterdam Convention (164 Parties);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Official contact points and national focal points for Stockholm Convention (184 Parties);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focal points for Montreal Protocol (198 Parties);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focal points for information exchange and national focal points for the Minamata Convention (currently 127 Parties).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secretariat of the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secretariat for the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (Ozone Secretariat);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secretariat of the Minamata Convention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basel Convention&lt;/strong&gt;: Pursuant to article 5 of the Basel Convention, Parties are required to designate or establish one or more competent authorities and one focal point to facilitate the implementation of the Convention. Parties also have an obligation to inform the Secretariat of any changes regarding designations made by them. The Conference of the Parties has adopted a standard form for notification of designation of contacts (decision BC-11/21), which Parties are requested to use to transmit information to the Secretariat including modifications . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A list of competent authorities and focal points to the Basel Convention is maintained and regularly updated on the Convention website: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.basel.int/Countries/CountryContacts/tabid/1342/Default.aspx&quot;&gt;http://www.basel.int/Countries/CountryContacts/tabid/1342/Default.aspx&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to enable monitoring of the implementation of the Basel Convention by its Parties and to present reports on this matter to the Conference of Parties on a regular basis, the Convention establishes a mechanism for Parties to transmit information about implementation of the Convention. According to Article 13, the Parties, consistent with national laws and regulations, shall transmit, through the Secretariat, to the Conference of the Parties established under Article 15, before the end of each calendar year&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;, a report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on the previous calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article 13 mandates the Secretariat to receive and disseminate this and other types of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rotterdam Convention:&lt;/strong&gt; Pursuant to Article 4 of the Rotterdam Convention, each Party is required to designate one or more national authorities that shall be authorized to act on its behalf in the performance of the administrative functions required by the Convention. The Secretariat also communicates with an Official Contact Point (OCP) of a Party on official issues. Here too the Conference of the Parties has adopted a standard form for notification of designation of contacts (decision RC-6/13), which Parties are requested to use to transmit information to the Secretariat. A contacts database is available on the Rotterdam Convention website at http://www.pic.int/Countries/CountryContacts/tabid/3282/language/en-US/Default.aspx&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article 10 of the Convention sets out the obligations of Parties with respect to the future import of chemicals listed in Annex III. Parties have an ongoing obligation to submit to the Secretariat, as soon as possible and in any event no later than nine months after the date of dispatch of a decision guidance document, their &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;import response&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-3&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-3&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;(whether a final or interim response) concerning the future import of the chemical. If a Party modifies its response, it has an obligation to immediately submit the revised response to the Secretariat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article 14 in addition to other relevant Articles gives the mandate to the Secretariat to facilitate the information exchange. The Secretariat maintains various databases of information on the Convention website based on transmissions from Parties e.g. country profiles, database of import responses, national legislation collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stockholm Convention:&lt;/strong&gt; Pursuant to Article 9 of the Stockholm Convention, each Party shall designate a national focal point for the exchange of the information referred to in paragraph 1 of article 9. Pursuant to decision &lt;a href=&quot;http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/download.aspx?d=UNEP-POPS-COP.2-SC-2-16.English.PDF&quot;&gt;SC-2/16&lt;/a&gt; of the second meeting of the Conference of the Parties of the Stockholm Convention, Parties are invited to nominate Official Contact Points. A revised harmonised form for notification of designation of contacts has also been adopted by the Conference of the Parties to the Stockholm Convention for notification of contacts, including modifications (decision SC-6/26). The Secretariat also maintains for this Convention a database of country contacts at http://chm.pops.int/Countries/CountryContacts/tabid/304/Default.aspx&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parties to the Stockholm Convention are required to develop, endeavour to implement, update and review as appropriate, a plan explaining how they are going to implement the obligations under the Convention (Article 7) (&amp;#x201C;national implementation plans&amp;#x201D;). The plans are made available on the Convention website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore Article 9 specifies that the Parties facilitate or undertake the exchange of information relevant to the reduction or elimination of the production, use and release of persistent organic pollutants and alternatives to them directly and or through the Secretariat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A national report contains information on the measures taken by a Party in implementing the Stockholm Convention. The information provided in the national reports is one of the main references to be used for the evaluation of the effectiveness of the Convention in accordance with its Article 16. The Conference of the Parties (COP) decided at its first meeting that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;national reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; shall be submitted every four years. The Official Contact Point has the authority to submit a national report to the Secretariat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parties requested the Secretariat of the Minamata Convention to facilitate cooperation in the exchange of information referred to Article 17, including with respect to the designation of national focal points, pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article 17 of the Minamata Convention. Article 24 of the Convention further includes in the functions of the Secretariat, &lt;em&gt;inter alia&lt;/em&gt;, to assist Parties in the exchange of information related to the implementation of the Convention, and to prepare and make to the Parties period reports based on information received pursuant to Article 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Montreal Protocol, the role of the Secretariat is stipulated in Article 12 of the Protocol including the obligation to receive, data provided pursuant to Article 7. Additionally, under Article 4B, each Party is required, within three months of the date of introducing its licensing system, to report to the Secretariat on the establishment and operation of that system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance of the Parties with their reporting obligations is considered by an Implementation Committee established under the Protocol&amp;#x2019;s Non-Compliance Procedure and is determined by the Meeting of the Parties based on the Committee&amp;#x2019;s recommendations (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ozone.unep.org/list-of-implementation-committee-recommendations&quot;&gt;https://ozone.unep.org/list-of-implementation-committee-recommendations&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-3&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; The import response may consist of an interim response that is not necessarily a decision see for example Article 10(4)(b)(ii)-(iv) &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-3&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed indicator is process-oriented, focusing on compliance with the obligations that contribute to the overall target of achieving the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#x2019;t measure the quantity of chemicals in media and doesn&amp;#x2019;t quantify adverse impacts on human health and the environment. The MEAs, however, were developed and adopted to address the most urgent challenges for human health and the environment and therefore, through the implementation of MEAs progress will be made to reduce release to air, water and soil and well as presence of hazardous chemicals in products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transmission of information as required by the five Conventions follows a different timing. This is the reason why the reporting to this indicator has been scheduled for 5-year cycles, which would allow capturing the compliance of Parties with the transmission of information of all the Conventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please also note that the timing for submission of reporting for the Minamata Convention has not yet been agreed on. It is not clear whether any reporting will be required prior to 2020, nor it is clear how many times reporting would be required prior to 2030. Thus, the Minamata Convention is included here, but the reporting is subject to further decisions on this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the following methodology, reporting is to take place in 2017 for the period 2010-2014, in 2020 for the period 2015-2019, in 2025 for the period 2020-2024 and in 2030 for the period 2025-2029. Reporting parameters include the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Country Score depends on the amount of information that is sent to the Conventions&amp;#x2019; Secretariat, and is calculated as follows (and communicated by the Secretariats):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Basel Convention:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Designation of the Focal Point and one or more Competent Authorities (1 point);&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Designation of the Designated National Authority(-ies) and Official contact point (1 point);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Submission of the import responses during the reporting period (0,2 point per import response).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For transmission of notifications of designations of country contacts in accordance with the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions, the revised form has been harmonised and may be used to transmit information on designated contacts in accordance with the provisions of any or all three of the Conventions. This is intended to facilitate transmission of information to the Secretariat while respecting the legal autonomy of each Convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Minamata Convention, States or regional economic integration are invited to designate national focal points using the form and the sample letter available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mercuryconvention.org/Countries/Parties/FocalPoints/tabid/7708/language/en-US/Default.aspx&quot;&gt;https://www.mercuryconvention.org/Countries/Parties/FocalPoints/tabid/7708/language/en-US/Default.aspx&lt;/a&gt; Guidance for the submission of national reports is available at https://www.mercuryconvention.org/Countries/Parties/Reporting/tabid/8189/language/en-US/Default.aspx&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Montreal protocol does not provide any guidance to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level. However, the parties adopted data reporting forms to guide the parties on the information to be reported to the Secretariat. Additionally, under the institutions of the protocol, developing countries get technical and financial assistance, part of which includes training manuals and other resources and guidance on compilation reporting of data - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unenvironment.org/ozonaction/resources&quot;&gt;https://www.unenvironment.org/ozonaction/resources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BRS Secretariat reviews the national reports for completeness and correctness and communicates with Parties with a view of addressing identified gaps, when possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Committee administering the Mechanism for Promoting Implementation and Compliance (ICC), which is a subsidiary body of the Basel Convention, there is a standing area of work on the national reporting which aims at improving timely and complete national reporting under paragraph 3 of Article 13 of the Convention. Activities in the biennium 2020-2021 include, inter alia, classifying and, as appropriate, publishing information on Parties&amp;#x2019; compliance with their annual national reporting obligations for 2016 and 2017 based on the assumptions, criteria and categories adopted by the Conference of the Parties at its thirteenth meeting and the targets adopted by the Conference of the Parties at its fourteenth meeting; developing recommendations on the revision of targets referred to in paragraph 13 of decision BC-14/15 for the reports due for 2018 and subsequent years; and with a view to increasing the completeness and timeliness of national reporting under paragraph 3 of Article 13, exploring how individual Parties can integrate national reporting needs under the Basel Convention into the United Nations Development Assistance Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minamata Secretariat has a system in place to (i) review the completeness and correctness of the reports received; and (ii) to inform Parties about the outcomes of such review before the reports are published on the Minamata Convention website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secretariat for the Montreal Protocol uses an online reporting system with a database for collecting and managing the reported information. The system includes a variety of checks and validation rules to ensure completeness and consistency of the reported information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Basel and Stockholm Conventions the Electronic Reporting System is the tool to be used by Parties to submit their national reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For guidelines please see the responses for the question 4(h).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reporting format for the Minamata Convention on Mercury has been adopted by the first Conference of the Parties for the submission of national reports pursuant to Article 21. The Secretariat drafted guidance for the short reports (4 questions) to assist Parties. At its second meeting, the Conference of the Parties requested the Secretariat to draft guidance on how to fill out the full reporting format (48 questions), which is under preparation. An online reporting tool has been prepared by the Secretariat to assist Parties and facilitate collecting the information for the reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Montreal Protocol, the responsibility for quality assurance of the submitted data and information lies with the parties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions, information transmitted by Parties to the Secretariat is made available to the Conference of the Parties for monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Minamata Convention, the Secretariat can report very high reporting rates: 80% of Parties have submitted complete reports (data is available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mercuryconvention.org/Countries/Parties/Reporting/tabid/8189/language/en-US/Default.aspx&quot;&gt;https://www.mercuryconvention.org/Countries/Parties/Reporting/tabid/8189/language/en-US/Default.aspx&lt;/a&gt;) The Secretariat can also report that 80% of Parties have designated national focal points in a timely and appropriate manner (a list of designations is available at https://www.mercuryconvention.org/Countries/Parties/Notifications/tabid/3826/language/en-US/Default.aspx)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Montreal Protocol, the responsibility for the overall evaluation of fulfilling quality of the submitted data lies with the parties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data availability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;First baseline reporting cycle in 2017: data collected from 2010 to 2014;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Second reporting cycle in 2020: data collected from 2015 to 2019;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Third reporting cycle in 2025: data collected from 2020 to 2024;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fourth reporting cycle in 2030: data collected from 2025 to 2029.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is available at country level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is disaggregated by Convention, in addition to providing the average transmission rate of the five Conventions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the BRS Conventions, the data is produced by Parties and then transmitted to the Secretariat which makes it publicly available on the Conventions website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Minamata Convention, the data reported in this paper is only produced by countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Montreal Protocol, the data and information reported are produced by the Parties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relevant links to the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convenio de Rotterdam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Designación de la(s) Autoridad(es) Nacional(es) Designada(s) y de los Puntos de Contacto Oficiales;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convenio de Estocolmo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Designación de los puntos de contacto oficiales del Convenio de Estocolmo y de los puntos focales nacionales;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Presentación de informes nacionales según lo dispuesto en el artículo 21 del Convenio de Minamata.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conceptos:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Partes:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Países que han ratificado, aceptado, aprobado o accedido a un convenio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Información:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Las Partes del Convenio de Basilea tienen la obligación de presentar un informe nacional anual, tal como se establece en el apartado 3 del artículo 13, para permitir el seguimiento de la aplicación del Convenio de Basilea por sus Partes. Los informes deben contener, entre otras cosas, información relativa a los movimientos transfronterizos de desechos peligrosos u otros desechos en los que hayan participado las Partes, incluida la cantidad de desechos peligrosos y otros desechos exportados, su categoría, características, destino, cualquier país de tránsito y método de eliminación, tal como se indica en la respuesta a la notificación, la cantidad de desechos peligrosos y otros desechos importados, su categoría, características, origen y métodos de eliminación; información sobre los accidentes ocurridos durante el movimiento transfronterizo y la eliminación de los desechos peligrosos y otros desechos y sobre las medidas adoptadas para hacerles frente; información sobre las opciones de eliminación utilizadas dentro de la zona de su jurisdicción nacional; y otra información según el formato de notificación.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Las respuestas sobre la importación en el marco del Convenio de Rotterdam son las decisiones brindadas por las Partes que indican si consentirán o no la importación de los productos químicos incluidos en el Anexo III del Convenio y que están sujetos al procedimiento de consentimiento fundamentado previo (CFP). El artículo 10 del Convenio de Rotterdam establece las obligaciones de las Partes con respecto a la futura importación de productos químicos incluidos en el Anexo III.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; En virtud del Convenio de Estocolmo, las Partes tienen la obligación de informar sobre las medidas que han adoptado para aplicar las disposiciones del Convenio y sobre la eficacia de dichas medidas para cumplir los objetivos del Convenio. Los informes nacionales incluyen datos estadísticos sobre las cantidades totales de producción, importación y exportación de cada uno de los productos químicos enumerados en el anexo A y el anexo B o una estimación razonable de esos datos; y, en la medida de lo posible, una lista de los Estados de los que ha importado cada una de esas sustancias y de los Estados a los que ha exportado cada una de ellas. El Plan Nacional de Aplicación del Convenio de Estocolmo es un plan que explica cómo una Parte va a cumplir las obligaciones del Convenio y se esfuerza por poner en marcha dicho plan (&lt;a href=&quot;http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/Repository/conf/UNEP-POPS-CONF-4-AppendixII.5206ab9e-ca67-42a7-afee-9d90720553c8.pdf#Article%207&quot;&gt;Article 7&lt;/a&gt;). Los cambios en las obligaciones derivados de las enmiendas al Convenio o a sus anexos, por ejemplo, cuando se incluya un nuevo producto químico en los anexos del Convenio, una Parte revisará y actualizará su plan de aplicación, y transmitirá el plan actualizado a la Conferencia de las Partes en un plazo de dos años a partir de la entrada en vigor de la enmienda para ella, en consonancia con el apartado b) del párrafo 1 del Convenio (según el párrafo 7 del anexo de la decisión SC-1/12). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt; Los parámetros presentados a continuación se basan en las obligaciones de las Partes de transmitir información a la Secretaría, independientemente de sus circunstancias nacionales. Otra información que sólo debe ser comunicada a la Secretaría en función de las circunstancias nacionales, como una posible definición nacional de desechos peligrosos, posibles acuerdos del artículo 11 en el marco del Convenio de Basilea, o una posible exención en el marco del Convenio de Estocolmo no se incluiría, ya sea porque la Secretaría no está en condiciones de evaluar si la obligación de transmitir información se ha materializado por sí misma, o porque las Partes tienen el derecho de no hacer uso de un derecho. &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Fuentes de datos&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Descripción:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Convenio de Basilea: puntos focales nacionales, sistema de notificación electrónica para los informes nacionales anuales;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Convenio de Rotterdam: puntos de contacto oficiales, circular PIC para las respuestas de importación;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Convenio de Estocolmo: puntos de contacto oficiales; sistema electrónico de presentación de informes nacionales cada cuatro años, Planes Nacionales de Aplicación;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Protocolo de Montreal: puntos focales nacionales;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Convenio de Minamata: puntos focales nacionales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Proceso de recopilación:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Secretaría de los Convenios de Basilea, Rotterdam y Estocolmo reúne datos de los Puntos Focales de los Convenios de Basilea, los puntos de contacto Oficiales del Convenio de Rotterdam, los puntos de contacto oficiales del Convenio de Estocolmo, la Secretaría del Ozono de los puntos focales nacionales del Protocolo de Montreal, y la Secretaría del Convenio de Minamata de los puntos focales nacionales del Convenio de Minamata. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Calendario&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recopilación de datos:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Primer ciclo de presentación de informes: 2017;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Segundo ciclo de presentación de informes: 2020;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tercer ciclo de presentación de informes: 2025;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cuarto ciclo de presentación de informes: 2030.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Publicación de datos: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Primer ciclo de presentación de informes: 2010-2014; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Segundo ciclo de presentación de informes: 2015-2019; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Tercer ciclo de presentación de informes: 2020-2024; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Cuarto ciclo de presentación de informes: 2025-2029. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Proveedores de datos&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Puntos Focales y Autoridades Competentes para los Convenios de Basilea (185 Partes);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Autoridades Nacionales Designadas y puntos de contacto Oficiales para el Convenio de Rotterdam (180 Partes);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Puntos de contacto oficiales y puntos focales nacionales para el Convenio de Estocolmo (156 Partes);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Puntos focales para el Protocolo de Montreal (197 Partes);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Puntos focales para el intercambio de información y puntos focales nacionales para el Convenio de Minamata (actualmente 35 Partes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Compiladores de datos&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;  
  &lt;li&gt;Secretaría de los Convenios de Basilea, Rotterdam y Estocolmo; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secretaría del Ozono;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secretaría del Convenio de Minamata;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Justificación:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El indicador propuesto está orientado al proceso, centrándose en el cumplimiento de las obligaciones que contribuyen al objetivo general de lograr la gestión ambientalmente racional de los productos químicos y de todos los desechos a lo largo de su ciclo de vida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No mide&amp;#x2019; la cantidad de productos químicos en los medios de comunicación y no&amp;#x2019; cuantifica los impactos adversos sobre la salud humana y el medio ambiente. Sin embargo, los AMUMA se desarrollaron y adoptaron para abordar los retos más urgentes para la salud humana y el medio ambiente y, por lo tanto, a través de la aplicación de los AMUMA se avanzará en la reducción de las emisiones al aire, al agua y al suelo, así como de la presencia de sustancias químicas peligrosas en los productos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Comentarios y limitaciones:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La transmisión de información exigida por los cinco Convenios sigue un calendario diferente. Esta es la razón por la que la presentación de informes para este indicador se ha programado para ciclos de 5 años, lo que permitiría captar el cumplimiento de las Partes con la transmisión de información de todos los Convenios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;También hay que tener en cuenta que aún no se ha acordado el calendario de presentación de informes para el Convenio de Minamata. No está claro si se requerirán informes antes de 2020, ni tampoco está claro cuántas veces se requerirán informes antes de 2030. Por lo tanto, el Convenio de Minamata se incluye aquí, pero la presentación de informes está sujeta a nuevas decisiones al respecto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Metodología&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Método de cálculo:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En la siguiente metodología, la presentación de informes se llevará a cabo en 2017 para el período 2010-2014, en 2020 para el período 2015-2019, en 2025 para el período 2020-2024 y en 2030 para el período 2025-2029. Entre los parámetros de informe se incluyen los siguientes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La puntuación por país depende de la cantidad de información que se envía a los Secretariados de los Convenios, y se calcula de la siguiente manera (y es comunicada por los Secretariados):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convenio de Basel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Designación del punto focal y de una o más autoridades competentes (punto 1);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Presentación de los informes nacionales anuales durante el período que abarca el informe (1 punto por informe).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convenio de Rotterdam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Designación de la(s) Autoridad(es) Nacional(es) Designada(s) y punto de contacto oficial (1 punto);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Presentación de las respuestas de importación durante el período que se informa (0,2 puntos por respuesta de importación).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Convenio de Estocolmo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Designación del punto de contacto oficial del Convenio de Estocolmo y del centro de coordinación nacional (1 punto);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Presentación del plan nacional de aplicación (1 punto);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Presentación de los planes nacionales de aplicación revisados en los que se abordan las enmiendas aprobadas por la Conferencia de las Partes en el período que abarca el informe (1 punto por plan revisado y actualizado)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-3&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protocolo de Montreal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cumplimiento de los requisitos de presentación de informes para la producción y el consumo de sustancias que agotan la capa de ozono en virtud del (artículo 7 del) Protocolo de Montreal (15 puntos)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Presentación de información sobre los sistemas de concesión de licencias en virtud del Protocolo de Montreal (artículo 4B) (5 puntos).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convenio de Minamata&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-4&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Designación de un punto focal nacional (artículo 17) (5 puntos).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Presentación del informe nacional (artículo 21) (15 puntos).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Parties : &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; Pays qui ont ratifié, accepté, approuvé ou accédé à une convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Information : &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; Les Parties à la Convention de Bâle ont l&apos;obligation de présenter un rapport national annuel tel que prévu par l&apos;article 13, paragraphe 3, afin de permettre le suivi de la mise en oeuvre de la Convention de Bâle par ses Parties. Les rapports doivent contenir, entre autres, des informations concernant les mouvements transfrontières de déchets dangereux ou d&apos;autres déchets dans lesquels les Parties ont été impliquées, y compris la quantité de déchets dangereux et d&apos;autres déchets exportés, leur catégorie, leurs caractéristiques, leur destination, tout pays de transit et leur méthode d&apos;élimination, comme indiqué dans la réponse à la notification, la quantité de déchets dangereux et d&apos;autres déchets importés, leur catégorie, leurs caractéristiques, leur origine et leurs méthodes d&apos;élimination ; des informations sur les accidents survenus au cours des mouvements transfrontaliers et de l&apos;élimination des déchets dangereux et d&apos;autres déchets et sur les mesures prises pour y faire face ; des informations sur les options d&apos;élimination utilisées dans la zone de leur juridiction nationale ; et d&apos;autres informations selon le format de rapport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les réponses aux demandes d&apos;importation en vertu de la Convention de Rotterdam sont les décisions fournies par les Parties indiquant si elles consentent ou non à importer les produits chimiques inscrits à l&apos;annexe III de la Convention et soumis à la procédure de consentement préalable en connaissance de cause (PIC). L&apos;article 10 de la Convention de Rotterdam énonce les obligations des Parties en ce qui concerne l&apos;importation future des produits chimiques inscrits à l&apos;annexe III.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En vertu de la Convention de Stockholm, une Partie a l&apos;obligation de faire rapport sur les mesures qu&apos;elle a prises pour appliquer les dispositions de la Convention et sur l&apos;efficacité de ces mesures pour atteindre les objectifs de la Convention. Les rapports nationaux comprennent des données statistiques sur les quantités totales de production, d&apos;importation et d&apos;exportation de chacune des substances chimiques inscrites aux annexes A et B, ou une estimation raisonnable de ces données ; et, dans la mesure du possible, une liste des États d&apos;où elle a importé chacune de ces substances et des États vers lesquels elle a exporté chacune de ces substances. Un plan national de mise en œuvre au titre de la Convention de Stockholm est un plan expliquant comment une Partie va s&apos;acquitter des obligations découlant de la Convention et s&apos;efforcer de mettre en œuvre ce plan (&lt;a href=&quot;http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/Repository/conf/UNEP-POPS-CONF-4-AppendixII.5206ab9e-ca67-42a7-afee-9d90720553c8.pdf#Article%207&quot;&gt;Article 7&lt;/a&gt;). Les modifications des obligations découlant des amendements à la Convention ou à ses annexes, par exemple lorsqu&apos;une nouvelle substance chimique est inscrite aux annexes de la Convention, une Partie examinera et mettra à jour son plan de mise en œuvre, et transmettra le plan mis à jour à la Conférence des Parties dans les deux ans suivant l&apos;entrée en vigueur de l&apos;amendement la concernant, conformément au paragraphe 1 b) de la Convention (selon le paragraphe 7 de l&apos;annexe à la décision SC-1/12). 5229]&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Les paramètres présentés ci-dessous sont basés sur les obligations des Parties de transmettre des informations au Secrétariat, quelle que soit sa situation nationale.  D&apos;autres informations qui ne doivent être communiquées au Secrétariat que sur la base de circonstances nationales, telles que d&apos;éventuelles définitions nationales des déchets dangereux, d&apos;éventuels accords au titre de l&apos;article 11 de la Convention de Bâle, ou d&apos;éventuelles exemptions au titre de la Convention de Stockholm, ne seraient pas incluses, soit parce que le Secrétariat n&apos;est pas en mesure d&apos;évaluer si l&apos;obligation de transmettre des informations s&apos;est matérialisée, soit parce que les Parties ont le droit de ne pas faire usage d&apos;un droit. &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Sources de données &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Convention de Bâle : points de contact nationaux, système de notification électronique pour les rapports nationaux annuels ; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Convention de Rotterdam : points de contact officiels, circulaire PIC pour les réponses aux importations ; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convention de Stockholm : points de contact officiels, système de notification électronique pour les rapports nationaux tous les quatre ans, plans nationaux de mise en œuvre ;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Protocole de Montréal : points de contact nationaux ; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convention de Minamata : points focaux nationaux. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Processus de collecte :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les données sont collectées par le Secrétariat des Conventions de Bâle, de Rotterdam et de Stockholm auprès des points focaux pour les Conventions de Bâle, des points de contact officiels pour la Convention de Rotterdam, des points de contact officiels pour la Convention de Stockholm, par le Secrétariat de l&apos;ozone auprès des points focaux nationaux pour le Protocole de Montréal, et par le Secrétariat de la Convention de Minamata auprès des points focaux nationaux pour la Convention de Minamata. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Calendrier &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Collecte de données : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Premier cycle de déclaration : 2017 ;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deuxième cycle de déclaration : 2020 ; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Troisième cycle de collecte d&apos;informations : 2025 ; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quatrième cycle de collecte des données : 2030. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Publication des données : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Premier cycle de déclaration : 2010-2014 ; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deuxième cycle de déclaration : 2015-2019 ;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Troisième cycle de déclaration : 2020-2024 ;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quatrième cycle de présentation des rapports : 2025-2029.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Fournisseurs de données &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Points focaux et Autorités compétentes pour les Conventions de Bâle (185 Parties) ; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Autorités nationales désignées et points de contact officiels pour la Convention de Rotterdam (180 Parties) ; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Points de contact officiels et points focaux nationaux pour la Convention de Stockholm (156 Parties) ;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Points focaux pour le Protocole de Montréal (197 Parties) ;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Points focaux pour l&apos;échange d&apos;informations et points focaux nationaux pour la Convention de Minamata (actuellement 35 Parties).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Compilateurs de données &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secrétariat des Conventions de Bâle, de Rotterdam et de Stockholm ; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secrétariat de l&apos;ozone ; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secrétariat de la Convention de Minamata. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Justification : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L&apos;indicateur proposé est axé sur les processus et se concentre sur le respect des obligations qui contribuent à l&apos;objectif global de gestion écologiquement rationnelle des produits chimiques et de tous les déchets tout au long de leur cycle de vie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;]Il ne mesure pas la quantité de produits chimiques dans les médias et ne quantifie pas les impacts négatifs sur la santé humaine et l&apos;environnement. Les AME, cependant, ont été élaborés et adoptés pour répondre aux défis les plus urgents pour la santé humaine et l&apos;environnement et, par conséquent, grâce à la mise en œuvre des AME, des progrès seront réalisés pour réduire les rejets dans l&apos;air, l&apos;eau et le sol ainsi que la présence de produits chimiques dangereux dans les produits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Commentaires et limites : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La transmission d&apos;informations telle que requise par les cinq Conventions suit un calendrier différent. C&apos;est la raison pour laquelle les rapports sur cet indicateur ont été programmés pour des cycles de 5 ans, ce qui permettrait de saisir la conformité des Parties avec la transmission d&apos;informations de toutes les Conventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Veuillez également noter que le calendrier de soumission des rapports pour la Convention de Minamata n&apos;a pas encore été convenu. Il n&apos;est pas clair si des rapports seront exigés avant 2020, ni combien de fois des rapports seront exigés avant 2030. Ainsi, la Convention de Minamata est incluse ici, mais le rapport est soumis à des décisions ultérieures à ce sujet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Méthodologie&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Méthode de calcul :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dans la méthodologie suivante, la déclaration doit avoir lieu en 2017 pour la période 2010-2014, en 2020 pour la période 2015-2019, en 2025 pour la période 2020-2024 et en 2030 pour la période 2025-2029. Les paramètres de déclaration sont les suivants : &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le score du pays dépend de la quantité d&apos;informations qui est envoyée au Secrétariat des Conventions&amp;#x2019 ; et est calculé comme suit (et communiqué par les Secrétariats) :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convention de Bâle :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Désignation du point focal et d&apos;une ou plusieurs autorités compétentes (1 point);&lt;/li&gt;.
  &lt;li&gt;Soumission des rapports nationaux annuels pendant la période de référence (1 point par rapport).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convention de Rotterdam :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Désignation de la ou des autorités nationales désignées et du point de contact officiel (1 point) ;&lt;/li&gt;.
  &lt;li&gt;Soumission des réponses à l&apos;importation pendant la période de déclaration (0,2 point par réponse à l&apos;importation).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convention de Stockholm :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Désignation du point de contact officiel de la Convention de Stockholm et du point focal national (1 points);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soumission du plan national de mise en œuvre (1 points);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soumission du ou des plans nationaux de mise en œuvre révisés portant sur les amendements adoptés par la Conférence des Parties au cours de la période considérée (1 point par plan révisé et mis à jour)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-3&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protocole de Montréal :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conformité aux exigences de déclaration de la production et de la consommation de substances appauvrissant la couche d&apos;ozone en vertu (de l&apos;article 7) du Protocole de Montréal (15 points);&lt;/li&gt;.
  &lt;li&gt;Soumission d&apos;informations sur les systèmes d&apos;autorisation en vertu de (l&apos;article 4B de) du Protocole de Montréal (5 points).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convention de Minamata&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-4&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Désignation d&apos;un point focal national (article 17) (5 points);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soumission du rapport national (article 21) (15 points).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;li&gt; Базельская конвенция о контроле за трансграничной перевозкой опасных отходов
и их удалением (Базельская конвенция); &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Роттердамская конвенция о процедуре предварительного обоснованного согласия
в отношении некоторых опасных химических веществ и пестицидов в международной торговле (Роттердамская конвенция); &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Стокгольмская конвенция о стойких органических загрязнителях (Стокгольмская
конвенция); &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Монреальский протокол по веществам, разрушающим озоновый слой (Монреальский
протокол); &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Минаматская конвенция о ртути (Минаматская конвенция). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; и которые представили информацию в Секретариат каждого МЭС, как того требует каждое из соглашений. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Требуемая информация включает в себя: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Базельская конвенция&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-2&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Назначение координатора и одного или нескольких компетентных органов; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Представление годовых национальных отчетов. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Роттердамская конвенция: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Назначение уполномоченного национального органа (-ов) и официальных контактных
лиц; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Представление ответов, касающихся импорта. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Стокгольмская конвенция: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Назначение официальных контактных лиц Стокгольмской конвенции и национальных
координаторов; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Представление национальных планов реализации; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Представление пересмотренного национального плана реализации с учетом поправок;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Представление национальных отчетов. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Монреальский протокол: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Соблюдение требований к отчетности о производстве и потреблении озоноразрушающих
веществ согласно (статье 7) Монреальского протокола; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Представление информации о системах лицензирования согласно (статье 4B) Монреальского
протокола. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Минаматская конвенция: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Назначение национального координатора для обмена информацией в соответствии
со статьей 17 Конвенции; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Представление национальных отчетов в соответствии со статьей 21 Минаматской
конвенции. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Понятия: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt; Стороны: &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; Страны, которые ратифицировали, приняли, одобрили конвенцию или присоединились к ней. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt; Информация: &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; Стороны Базельской конвенции обязаны представлять ежегодный национальный отчет в соответствии с пунктом 3 статьи 13, чтобы обеспечить возможность мониторинга выполнения Базельской конвенции ее Сторонами. Эти отчеты должны содержать, в частности, информацию о трансграничных перевозках опасных или других отходов, в которых участвовали Стороны, включая количество экспортируемых опасных и других отходов, их категорию, характеристики, место назначения, любую страну транзита и метод утилизации, как указано в ответе на уведомление, количество ввезенных опасных и других отходов, их категория, характеристики, происхождение и методы утилизации; информация об авариях, произошедших при трансграничной перевозке и утилизации опасных и других отходов, и о мерах, принятых для их устранения; информация о вариантах утилизации, действующих в пределах их национальной юрисдикции; и другая информация согласно формату отчетности. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ответы, касающиеся импорта в соответствии с Роттердамской конвенцией - это заключения, предоставленные Сторонами с указанием того, будут ли они согласны или не согласны на импорт химических веществ, перечисленных в Приложении III к Конвенции, и подлежащих процедуре получения предварительного обоснованного согласия (ПОС). В статье 10 Роттердамской конвенции излагаются обязательства Сторон в отношении будущего импорта химических веществ, перечисленных в приложении III. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; В соответствии со Стокгольмской конвенцией Сторона обязана сообщать о мерах, принятых ею для выполнения положений Конвенции, и об эффективности таких мер в достижении целей Конвенции. Национальные отчеты включают статистические данные по общим объемам производства, импорта и экспорта каждого из химических веществ, перечисленных в Приложении A и Приложении B, или разумную оценку таких данных; и, насколько это практически возможно, список государств, из которых он импортировал каждое такое вещество, и государств, в которые он экспортировал каждое такое вещество. Национальный план реализации в соответствии со Стокгольмской конвенцией - это план, объясняющий, как Сторона собирается выполнять обязательства в соответствии с Конвенцией, и прилагать усилия для реализации такого плана. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/Repository/conf/UNEP-POPS-CONF-4-AppendixII.5206ab9e-ca67-42a7-afee-9d90720553c8.pdf#Article%207&quot;&gt;Статья 7&lt;/a&gt;). Изменения в обязательствах, вытекающие из поправок к Конвенции или приложениям к ней, например, когда новое химическое вещество включено в приложения к Конвенции, Сторона пересматривает и обновляет свой план реализации и передает обновленный план Конференции Сторон в течение двух лет после вступления в силу поправки к нему в соответствии с пунктом 1 (b) Конвенции (согласно пункту 7 приложения к решению SC-1/12). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-2&quot;&gt; 2 &lt;/sup&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt; Представленные ниже параметры основаны на обязательствах Сторон передавать информацию в Секретариат, независимо от ее национальных условий. Другая информация, которую необходимо передать только в секретариат с учетом национальных условий, таких как возможные национальные определения опасных отходов, возможные соглашения по статье 11 в рамках Базельской конвенции или возможные исключения из Стокгольмской конвенции, не будет включена либо потому, что Секретариат не в состоянии оценить, материализовалось ли обязательство по передаче информации, или потому что Стороны имеют право не использовать какое-либо правовое положение. &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt; &amp;#x2191; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Источники данных &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; Описание: &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Базельская конвенция: национальные координаторы, электронная система отчетности для подготовки годовых национальных отчетов; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Роттердамская конвенция: официальные контактные лица, циркуляр ПОС по представлению ответов, касающихся импорта; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Стокгольмская конвенция: официальные контактные лица; система электронной отчетности для подготовки национальных отчетов каждые четыре года, национальные планы реализации; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Монреальский протокол: национальные координаторы; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Минаматская конвенция: национальные координаторы. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Процесс сбора: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Данные собираются Секретариатом Базельской, Роттердамской и Стокгольмской конвенций от координаторов по Базельской конвенции, официальных контактных лиц по Роттердамской конвенции, официальных контактных лиц по Стокгольмской конвенции, Секретариатом по озону от национальных координаторов по Монреальскому протоколу, а также Секретариатом Минаматской конвенции от национальных координаторов по Минаматской конвенции. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Календарь &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Сбор данных: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Первый цикл отчетности: 2017 г.; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Второй цикл отчетности: 2020 г.; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Третий отчетный цикл: 2025 г.; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Четвертый цикл отчетности: 2030 г. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Выпуск данных: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Первый цикл отчетности: 2010-2014 гг.; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Второй цикл отчетности: 2015–2019 гг.; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Третий цикл отчетности: 2020–2024 гг.; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Четвертый цикл отчетности: 2025-2029 гг. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Поставщики данных &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Координаторы и компетентные органы по Базельской конвенции (185 Сторон); &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Назначенные уполномоченные национальные органы и официальные контактные лица по Роттердамской конвенции (180 Сторон); &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Официальные контактные лица и национальные координаторы по Стокгольмской конвенции (156 Сторон); &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Координаторы по Монреальскому протоколу (197 Сторон); &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Координаторы по обмену информацией и национальные координаторы по Минаматской конвенции (в настоящее время 35 Сторон). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Составители данных &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Секретариат Базельской, Роттердамской и Стокгольмской конвенций; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Секретариат по озону; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Секретариат Минаматской конвенции. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Обоснование: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Предлагаемый показатель ориентирован на процесс с упором на соблюдение обязательств, которые способствуют реализации общей цели по достижению рационального использования с экологической точки зрения химических веществ и всех отходов на протяжении всего их жизненного цикла. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Показатель не определяет количество химических веществ в среде и не дает количественной оценки неблагоприятного воздействия на здоровье человека и окружающую среду. Однако многосторонние экологические соглашения (МЭС) были разработаны и приняты с целью решения наиболее неотложных проблем для здоровья человека и окружающей среды, и поэтому за счет реализации МЭС будет достигнут прогресс в сокращении выбросов в воздух, воду и почву, а также в снижении наличия опасных химических веществ в продуктах. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Комментарии и ограничения: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Передача информации в соответствии с требованиями пяти конвенций осуществляется в различные сроки. Причина этого в том, что отчетность по этому показателю была запланирована на 5-летние циклы, которые позволили бы фиксировать соблюдение Сторонами передачи информации по всем конвенциям. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Также обратите внимание, что сроки представления отчетности по Минаматской конвенции еще не согласованы. Неясно, потребуется ли какая-либо отчетность до 2020 года, равно как и неясно, сколько раз потребуется представлять отчетность до 2030 года. Таким образом, Минаматская конвенция сюда включена, но вопрос отчетности по ней еще требует принятия решения.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Методология&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Метод расчета:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Согласно следующей методике, отчетность должна быть предоставлена в 2017 году за период 2010-2014 годов, в 2020 году за период 2015-2019 годов, в 2025 году за период 2020-2024 годов и в 2030 году за период 2025-2029 годов. Параметры отчетности включают следующее: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Страновой балл (СБ) зависит от объема информации, представляемой в Секретариат конвенции, и рассчитывается следующим образом (и объявляется секретариатами): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Басельская конвенция:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Назначение координатора и одного или нескольких компетентных органов (1 балл);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Представление в течение отчетного периода годовых национальных отчетов (1
балл за отчет).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Роттердамская конвенция:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Назначение уполномоченного национального органа (-ов) и официальных контактных
лиц (1 балл);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Представление в течение отчетного периода ответов, касающихся импорта (0,2
балла за ответ, касающийся импорта). &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Стокгольмская конвенция:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Назначение официальных контактных лиц Стокгольмской конвенции и национального
координатора (1 балл);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Представление национального плана реализации (1 балл);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Представление в течение отчетного периода пересмотренного национального плана
(ов) реализации с учетом поправок, принятых Конференцией Сторон (1 балл за каждый пересмотренный и обновленный план). &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-3&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Монреальский протокол:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Соблюдение требований к отчетности о производстве и потреблении озоноразрушающих
веществ согласно (статье 7) Монреальского протокола (15 баллов);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Представление информации о системах лицензирования согласно (статье 4B) Монреальского
протокола (5 баллов).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Минаматская конвенция:&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-4&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Назначение национального координатора (статья 17) (5 баллов);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Представление национального отчета (статья 21) (15 баллов).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
