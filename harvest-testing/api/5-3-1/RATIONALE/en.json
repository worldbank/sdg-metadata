Child marriage often compromises a girl&#x2019;s development by resulting in early pregnancy and social isolation, interrupting her schooling, limiting her opportunities for career and vocational advancement and placing her at increased risk of intimate partner violence.

These include entering a union and becoming a mother. </p>\n<p>The practice of early/child marriage is a direct manifestation of gender inequality. </p>\n<p>The issue of child marriage is addressed in a number of international conventions and agreements. Although marriage is not mentioned directly in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, child marriage is linked to other rights &#x2013; such as the right to freedom of expression, the right to protection from all forms of abuse, and the right to be protected from harmful traditional practices.</p>"}
