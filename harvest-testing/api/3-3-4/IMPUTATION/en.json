The estimates are not always the same as the official national estimates, because of the use of different methodologies and data sources. Estimates are provided for 194 WHO Member States. The analysis was carried out for the age groups 0-5 years and for the general population. Due to scarcity of data from some countries, the estimates are more robust at global and regional level than at country level, therefore, we suggest countries focus on the 95% Credible Intervals and not only on the reported point estimates.</p>\n<p>A thorough and robust literature review was undertaken to find studies across the 194 WHO Member States and across age groups and vaccination status. We updated the systematic review by Schweitzer et al, 2015 that included a systematic search on articles published between Jan 1, 1965, and Oct 23, 2013. We updated the systematic search to include articles published between Oct 23, 2013, and October 30, 2018 in the databases Embase, PubMed, Global Index Medicus, Popline, and Web of Science. </p>\n<p>For each country that had prevalence data, a weighted central position was calculated using the size and location of each study. For those countries with no data, we used the population centroid. Please see detailed explanation above.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>At regional and global levels:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Same as above</p>"}
