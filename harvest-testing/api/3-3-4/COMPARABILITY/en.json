The study selection criteria were similar to (Schweitzer, et al., 2015). Observational studies on chronic HBV infection seroprevalence (HBsAg prevalence), done in the general population or among blood donors, health-care workers (HCWs), and pregnant women were considered for inclusion in this systematic review. Studies were excluded if they were systematic reviews or meta-analyses, surveillance reports, case studies, letters or correspondence, or did not contain HBsAg seroprevalence data. Studies were also excluded if they exclusively reported prevalence estimates for high-risk population groups (e.g., migrants and refugees). Country estimates may come from selected serosurveys.</p>"}
