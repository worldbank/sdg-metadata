	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 3-3-4, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;This dataset represents the best estimates for the hepatitis B surface antigen indicator and aims to facilitate comparability across countries and over time. The estimates are not always the same as the official national estimates, because of the use of different methodologies and data sources e.g. special populations or populations at risk are not included in the hepatitis b seroprevalence model. Estimates are provided for 194 WHO Member States. The conditional autoregressive model uses data from well sampled countries to estimate prevalence in more data-poor countries taking account of effects such as sex, age and vaccination status. Due to scarcity of data from some countries, the estimates are more robust at global and regional level than at country level, therefore focus should be on the 95% Credible Intervals and not only on the reported point estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inclusion or exclusion criteria of the type of seroprevalence studies. Observational studies on chronic HBV infection seroprevalence (HBsAg prevalence), done in the general population or among blood donors, health-care workers (HCWs), and pregnant women were considered for inclusion. Studies were excluded if they were systematic reviews or meta-analyses, surveillance reports, case studies, letters or correspondence, or did not contain HBsAg seroprevalence data. Studies were also excluded if they exclusively reported prevalence estimates for high-risk population groups (e.g., migrants and refugees).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
