  &lt;li&gt;WHO&amp;#x2019;s estimates use a methodology reviewed by the Immunization and Vaccines Related Implementation Research Advisory Committee (IVIR-AC) and presented to the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE). These estimates have been documented following the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;WHO provided Member States the opportunity to review and comment on data and estimates as part of the so called country consultation process.&lt;/li&gt;
