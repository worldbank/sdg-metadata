{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 14-4-1, translated into en","data":"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n<p>The indicator measures the sustainability of fishery resources, and is an end-result measure of Target 14.4. Its derivation requires the data and technical expertise necessary to perform stock assessment. The indicator at global level is estimated by the FAO based on the methodology developed in the 1980s. Although regular updates were carried out to incorporate technical advances and changes in major fish species, some discrepancies between regions may occur in the representativeness of the reference list in practical fisheries. However, this will not pose a large impact on the reliability of the indicator&#x2019;s temporal trends.</p>\n<p>For the national level, the composition of stocks within the reference list of stocks and the selection criteria used to develop the list will vary between countries, making the indicator suitable for checking countries&#x2019; own progress over time. However, this reduces the comparability of sustainability levels between countries. </p>"}
