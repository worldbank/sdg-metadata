Some countries may have classic stock assessments already conducted for many of their stocks, while others may have very few or no assessments available. </p>\n<p>For some countries, little stock assessment has been done. To help these countries and to facilitate their reporting, FAO prepared online materials and tools, including a selection of methods that can be used to evaluate stock status with data limited methods such as length-based and catch-only methods. The strengths and limitations of these methods are discussed in an eLearning course (Lesson 4), and caveats were also provided to avoid misuse and exercise cautions in practice. Furthermore, capacity building workshops have been organised to provide support to countries in stock assessment and reporting on the SDG 14.4.1.</p>\n<p><strong>eLearning course:</strong> <a href=\"https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=502\">https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=502</a></p>"}
