The methodology is described in the FAO Technical Paper (FAO 2011). </p>\n<p> FAO has been developing the new approach for country-level reporting since 2017, and has consulted with countries in three dedicated expert consultation workshops: In November 2017, FAO convened a workshop to exchange views with national practitioners on the new proposed analytical methods to produce Indicator 14.4.1 at country level<sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-ref-1\">[1]</a></sup>. In February 2019, FAO convened an expert consultation workshop<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[2]</a></sup> on development of the methodologies for the global assessment of fish stock status, with participants from countries and regional fisheries organizations. In October 2019, FAO organized a capacity development workshop on stock status assessment and estimation methods of SDG Indicator 14.4.1 for the Asia Pacific Region, with participants from 17 countries.<strong> </strong>However, so far very few countries have started their own estimation and reporting of Indicator 14.4.1.</p>\n<p><strong>Global/Regional:</strong></p>\n<p>Global and regional estimates of stock sustainability have been performed for 584 fish stocks around the world since 1974, representing 70% of global landings. Each stock is estimated using the methodology described in the FAO Technical Paper (FAO, 2011). </p>\n<p><strong>National:</strong></p>\n<p>The indicator is calculated as the number of stocks with sustainable status divided by the number of stocks with known status in the reference list. This proportion is calculated based on stock numbers, without weighting either by its production volume or stock abundance; that is, every fish stock is considered to have the same importance. </p>\n<p>Countries are requested to report the status of a reference list of fish stocks, which should be determined based on the significance of a specific stock in a society, either in landings, economic contribution to society, or cultural and traditional values, rather than based on whether stock assessment exists.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-1\">1</sup><p> Full report accessible here: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/I8714EN/%20%20\">http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/I8714EN/ </a>  <a href=\"#footnote-ref-1\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">2</sup><p> Full report accessible here<a href=\":%20http:/www.fao.org/3/ca4355en/ca4355en.pdf%20%20\">: http://www.fao.org/3/ca4355en/ca4355en.pdf </a> <a href=\"#footnote-ref-2\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>"}
