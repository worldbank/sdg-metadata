	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Concepts and definitions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definition:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator Proportion of marine fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels measures the sustainability of the world&amp;apos;s marine capture fisheries by their abundance. A fish stock whose abundance is at or greater than the level, that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as biologically sustainable. In contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY level, the stock is considered biologically unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSY is defined as the greatest amount of catch that can be harvested continuously from a stock under constant and current environmental conditions (e.g., habitat, water conditions, species composition and interactions, and anything that could affect birth, growth, or death rates of the stock) without affecting the long-term productivity of the stock. The indicator measures the sustainability of fish resources based a good balance between human use and ecological conservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSY-based reference points are the most common type of reference points used in fisheries management today. This is primarily because, for decades, reference points from surplus production models have most often been set based on the concept of MSY and they are the basic benchmarks for the sustainability of fisheries set by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, Article 61(3)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fish stock&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;refers to a group of individuals of a single species or sometimes combined species living in a defined area from which catches are taken in a fishery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;reference list of stocks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; should be established by each country and consists of a list of stocks selected according to FAO guidelines, against which the indicator will be reported (Appendix 1). The reference list should include national and shared stocks but not straddling stocks as defined below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;National stocks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are located completely within an EEZ and/or territorial waters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shared stocks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;are distributed within the EEZ and/or territorial waters of two or more adjacent countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Straddling stocks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are found to move across boundaries between EEZ waters or between EEZ and high seas (e.g. tuna stocks), and that are caught by multiple countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries are asked to report on stocks listed in its reference list, including those monitored through &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;official stock assessments&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by an authoritative agency, through a scientific process and using best available science and data. These assessments could be based on classic or data-limited methods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock assessment uses biological information, fishery data such as catch statistics and fishing effort, and scientific survey data to estimate population dynamics of fish stocks for management purposes. Stock assessment methods include biological dynamic models, age-structured models, length-based methods and stock recruitment models.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
