	<message>The REG_AGG field for indicator 14-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;As explained in the &amp;#x201C;Rationale&amp;#x201D; section, national data alone cannot be meaningfully aggregated at global/regional level because country-level reporting will be limited to the assessment of stocks that are found only within a country&amp;#x2019;s EEZ (including stocks shared with neighbouring countries&amp;#x2019; EEZs), and therefore not include straddling stocks, highly migratory species, or stocks in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ). Therefore, regional &amp;#x201C;aggregates&amp;#x201D; by FAO Major Fishing Area and the global indicator value are calculated with a specific approach, as described in the FAO Technical Paper (FAO 2011)&lt;/p&gt;</data>
