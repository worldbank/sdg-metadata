	<message>The STAT_CONC_DEF field for indicator 9-5-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Concepts and definitions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definition:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research and development (R&amp;amp;D) expenditure as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the amount of R&amp;amp;D expenditure divided by the total output of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OECD Frascati Manual (OECD, 2015) provides the relevant definitions for research and experimental development, gross domestic expenditure on R&amp;amp;D and researchers. Although an OECD manual, the application is global. During the 6th revision of the Frascati Manual, developing country issues were mainstreamed in the core of the Manual. The 7th edition was released in October 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following definitions, taken from the 2015 edition of the Frascati Manual are relevant for computing the indicator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research and experimental development (R&amp;amp;D) comprise creative and systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge &amp;#x2013; including knowledge of humankind, culture and society &amp;#x2013; and to devise new applications of available knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expenditures on intramural R&amp;amp;D represent the amount of money spent on R&amp;amp;D that is performed within a reporting unit.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
