{"status":"success","message":"The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 15-5-1, translated into en","data":"<p>Sources of discrepancies:</p>\n<p>Some countries have assessed the national extinction risk of species occurring in the country, and have repeated such assessments, allowing a national Red List Index to be produced. This may differ from the indicator described here because (a) it considers national rather than global extinction risk, and (b) because it takes no account of the national responsibility for the conservation of each species, treating as equal both those species that occur nowhere outside the country (i.e. national endemics) and those with large ranges that occur in many other countries. Any such differences will be smaller for countries within which a high proportion of species are endemic (i.e., only found in that country), as in many island nations and mountainous countries, especially in the tropics. The differences will be larger for countries within which a high proportion of species have widespread distributions across many nations.</p>"}
