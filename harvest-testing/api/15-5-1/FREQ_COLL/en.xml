&lt;h2&gt;Data collection:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is updated annually. Red List Indices for any sets of species that have been comprehensively reassessed in that year are usually released alongside the update of the IUCN Red List. Data are stored and managed in the Species Information Service database, and are made freely available for non-commercial use through the IUCN Red List website. Re-assessments of extinction risk are required for every species assessed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species once every ten years, and ideally undertaken once every four years. A Red List Strategic Plan details a calendar of upcoming re-assessments for each taxonomic group. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
