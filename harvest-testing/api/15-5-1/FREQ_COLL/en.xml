	<data>&lt;p&gt;The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is updated at least three times per year. Red List Indices for sets of species that have been comprehensively reassessed are usually released alongside the relevant update of the IUCN Red List. Data are stored and managed in the Species Information Service database, and are made freely available for non-commercial use through the IUCN Red List website (www.iucnredlist.org). Re-assessments of extinction risk are required for every species assessed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species once every ten years, and ideally undertaken once every five years. A Red List Strategic Plan details a calendar of upcoming re-assessments for each taxonomic group. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
