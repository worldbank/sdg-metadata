The start year of the aggregated index is set as ten years before the first assessment year for the taxonomic group with the latest starting point. Corals are not extrapolated linearly because declines are known to have been much steeper subsequent to 1996 (owing to extreme bleaching events) than before. Therefore the rate of decline prior to 1996 is set as the average of the rates for the other taxonomic groups.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>At regional and global levels:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Red List Index is calculated globally based on assessments of extinction risk of each species included, because many species have distributions which span many countries. Thus, while there is certainly uncertainty around the Red List Index, there are no missing values as such, and so no imputation is necessary.</p>"}
