In sum: all Red List assessments are peer reviewed through the relevant Red List Authority for the species or species group in question; and all Red List assessments undergo consistency checks (to ensure consistency with assessments submitted for other taxonomic groups, regions, processes, etc.) by the Red List Unit before publication on the Red List website (<a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/</a>). Finally, the Chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission (elected each four years by the government and non-governmental Members of IUCN) appoints a Chair for a Standards and Petitions Sub-Committee (<a href=\"https://www.iucn.org/theme/species/about/species-survival-commission/ssc-leadership-and-steering-committee/sub-committees/standards-and-petitions-subcommittee\">https://www.iucn.org/theme/species/about/species-survival-commission/ssc-leadership-and-steering-committee/sub-committees/standards-and-petitions-subcommittee</a>), which is responsible for ensuring the quality and standards of the IUCN Red List and for ruling on petitions against the listings of species on the IUCN Red List. </p>\n<p>In addition to dissemination via the Red List website (<a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/</a>), Red List data are disseminated through the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool, available for research and conservation online (<a href=\"https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/\">https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/</a>). This incorporates Country Profile documents for all of the world&#x2019;s countries, which includes documentation of the Red List Index indicator for the current year, starting from 2016. The first edition of each of these Country Profiles was sent for consultation to National Focal Points of the Convention on Biological Diversity (<a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml\">https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml</a>), at the 13th meeting of the Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity; and this process will be repeated annually.</p>"}
