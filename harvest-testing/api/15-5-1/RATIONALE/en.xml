	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 15-5-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The world&amp;#x2019;s species are impacted by a number of threatening processes, including habitat destruction and degradation, overexploitation, invasive alien species, human disturbance, pollution and climate change. This indicator can be used to assess overall changes in the extinction risk of groups of species as a result of these threats and the extent to which threats are being mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Red List Index value ranges from 1 (all species are categorized as &amp;#x2018;Least Concern&amp;#x2019;) to 0 (all species are categorized as &amp;#x2018;Extinct&amp;#x2019;), and so indicates how far the set of species has moved overall towards extinction. Thus, the global Red List Index allows comparisons between sets of species in both their overall level of extinction risk (i.e., how threatened they are on average), and in the rate at which this risk changes over time. A downward trend in the global Red List Index over time means that the expected rate of future species extinctions is worsening (i.e., the rate of biodiversity loss is increasing). An upward trend means that the expected rate of species extinctions is abating (i.e., the rate of biodiversity loss is decreasing), and a horizontal line means that the expected rate of species extinctions is remaining the same, although in each of these cases it does not mean that biodiversity loss has stopped. An upward global Red List Index trend would indicate that the SDG Target 15.5 of reducing the degradation of natural habitats and protecting threatened species is on track. A global Red List Index value of 1 would indicate that biodiversity loss has been halted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name &amp;#x201C;Red List Index&amp;#x201D; should not be taken to imply that the indicator is produced as a composite indicator of a number of disparate metrics (in the same way that, e.g., the Multidimensional Poverty Index is compiled). The Red List Index provides an indicator of trends in species&amp;#x2019; extinction risk, as measured using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (Mace et al. 2008, IUCN 2012a), and is compiled from data on changes over time in the Red List Category for each species, excluding any changes driven by improved knowledge or revised taxonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Red List Index was used as an indicator towards the 2011&amp;#x2013;2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014, CBD 2020a), the Convention on Biological Diversity&amp;#x2019;s 2010 Target (Butchart et al. 2010) and Millennium Development Goal 7. It has been proposed as a Headline Indicator in the draft post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (CBD 2020b).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
