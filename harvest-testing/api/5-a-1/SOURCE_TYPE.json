Thus, it can be collected through Agricultural surveys/ censuses or national household-based surveys having a suitable coverage of agricultural households Generally speaking, surveys are more cost-effective than censuses because they are carried out on a representative sample which is then used to estimate the parameters at the population level. </p>\n<p>Agricultural Surveys are a recommended data source for two main reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>their unit of analysis are agricultural holdings and, in most countries, a one-to-one relationship exists between the household-sector agricultural holdings and the agricultural households. Therefore, agricultural surveys capture well the reference population of indicator 5.a.1 (i.e. agricultural households) and they do not require any pre-screening and oversampling to generate nationally representative estimates.</li>\n  <li>agricultural surveys can easily accommodate questions on agricultural land tenure rights, since they frequently collect data regarding rights to agricultural land and data on agricultural production.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>National Household Surveys (NHS)<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-11\" id=\"footnote-ref-11\">[10]</a></sup></sup> are a recommended data source for indicator 5.a.1 for several reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>National Household surveys are the most common data source available in both developed and developing countries.</li>\n  <li>National Household surveys tend to be very broad in scope and they are normally used to generate social, demographic and economic statistics. Therefore they: i) can accommodate questions needed for the computation of indicator 5a1; ii) allow exploring associations between the individual status on indicator 5a1 and other individual or household characteristics, such as education, health, income level, etc; iii) can include additional data for a more detailed analysis of the indicator (eg., land size).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>However, if NHS are used to monitor indicator 5.a.1, it is necessary to identify agricultural households. In addition, especially in countries/regions with a low proportion of households is engaged in agricultural production, a pre-screening and oversampling may be needed, especially in urban and peri-urban areas. In the absence of agricultural or household-based surveys, agricultural censuses can be used for collecting data on SDG 5.a.1 Nonetheless, the Censuses present some disadvantages: </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>They are usually conducted every 10 years; therefore, they do not allow countries to closely monitor the progress on indicator 5.a.1.</li>\n  <li>They are large scale and costly operations focussing on the structure of the population.</li>\n  <li>They heavily rely on proxy respondents, an approach which is in contrast with the respondents&#x2019; selection procedure recommended for indicator 5.a.1. </li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Who should respond? How many people? </strong></p>\n<p>For indicator 5a1, it is crucial to: i) choose the number of individuals on which information is to be collected, and ii) determine who should report this information. Two options are suggested:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Option 1</strong>: Each adult member of the household is interviewed on his/her ownership / tenure rights over agricultural land (self-respondent approach applied to all members)</li>\n  <li><strong>Option 2</strong>: One randomly selected adult household member is interviewed on his/her ownership / tenure rights over agricultural land (self-respondent approach applied to one member)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In practice, due to budget constraints and time limitations, interviewing only one adult member per household will be the most viable option. However, if a country wants to study intra-household dynamics or to increase the precision of the 5a1 estimates, it may decide to collect information about each household member, using self-reported data. </p>\n<p>When collecting data on asset ownership from a gender perspective, it is not recommended to use proxy respondents, whereby the most knowledgeable household member is usually interviewed to collect information on all the household members<sup><a href=\"#footnote-12\" id=\"footnote-ref-12\">[11]</a></sup>. However, if the survey used as a vehicle for the collection of 5.a.1 data cannot adopt the self-respondent approach, then proxy respondents should be used to collect information on all household members.</p>\n<p><u>Minimum Set of Data</u></p>\n<p>A minimum set of data is needed to calculate the indicator summarized in the table below: </p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Whether or not the household has operated <strong>land</strong> for agricultural purposes and / or raised <strong>livestock</strong> over the past 12 months</p>\n      </td>\n      <td rowspan=\"3\">\n        <p>To identify adult individuals living in agricultural households, by sex</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Sex</strong> of the selected individual</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Age</strong> of the selected individual</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Whether or not the <strong>individual owns or holds</strong> any <strong>agricultural land</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td rowspan=\"5\">\n        <p>To identify land owners and/or rights bearers over the agricultural land based on the 3 proxies</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Whether or not any of the land owned or held by the individual has a <strong>legally recognized document </strong>that allows protecting his/her ownership / tenure rights over the land</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Whether or not the individual is<strong> listed as an owner or holder</strong> on any of the legally recognized documents, either alone of jointly with someone else</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Whether or not the individual has the <strong>right to sell</strong> any of the agricultural land, either alone or jointly with someone else</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Whether or not the individual has the <strong>right to bequeath</strong> any of the agricultural land, either alone or jointly with someone else</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p><u>Questions to Capture the Agricultural Population</u></p>\n<p>As mentioned above, the reference population (denominator) for indicator 5.a.1 are the individuals living in the agricultural households.

In particular, it was found that proxy-reported data decrease both women&#x2019;s and men&#x2019;s reported ownership of agricultural land. Such underestimation is greater for men (-15 percentage points) than for women (-10 percentage points), and is less pronounced when we consider documented ownership (-7 percentage points for men and -2 percentage points for women). <a href=\"#footnote-ref-12\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-13\">12</sup><p> A full list of data items, and their rationale can be found in UNSD (2019) <a href=\"#footnote-ref-13\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
