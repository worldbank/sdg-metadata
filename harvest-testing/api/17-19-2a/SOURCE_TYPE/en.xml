&lt;p&gt;ECOSOC resolution E/RES/2015/10 establishing the 2020 World Population and Housing Census Programme requests the Secretary-General to &amp;quot;monitor and regularly report to the Statistical Commission on the implementation of the Programme&amp;quot;. In response to this request UNSD regularly monitors the progress of implementation of population and housing censuses across Member States. UNSD sends a survey to all countries soliciting detailed metadata on census methods at three points (beginning, mid, end) over the 10-year spanning a census decade (currently the 2020 census round covering the years 2015-2024). In addition, information is also collected through the annual questionnaires sent to countries as part of the UN Demographic Yearbook collection.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
