	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 16-10-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering common challenges in the field of other crime statistics and administrative data sources, it is anticipated that the indicator will suffer from underreporting in some countries/contexts. Global data providers rely on reports from national sources with varying capacities to document incidents and to engage with international mechanisms. With the development of robust national data collection frameworks comprised of national human rights institutions, national statistical offices and civil society organizations supporting global data collection, supported by capacity building programmes and a periodic assessment of relevant networks, it is expected that discrepancies will be mitigated gradually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While national data may still be compiled according to national legal systems rather than ICCS, OHCHR and its partner agencies will support UNODC as it undertakes special efforts to ensure the gradual implementation of ICCS by countries. Over time, this should help improve quality and consistency of national and international data.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
