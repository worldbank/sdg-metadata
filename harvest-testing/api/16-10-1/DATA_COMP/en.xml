	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 16-10-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The indicator is calculated as the total count of victims of reported incidents occurring within the preceding 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on the ICCS, which is an incidents-based international classification system, the indicator counts victims on the basis of cases of violations or abuses using a classification framework developed for the purposes of the indicator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reporting purposes, the recorded offences will be ordered taking into account a hierarchy of violations or abuses drawing on the &amp;#x201C;most serious offence&amp;#x201D; rule commonly applied in crime statistics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Killing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Torture&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enforced disappearance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Arbitrary detention&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kidnapping&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other harmful acts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an incident incorporates elements of more than one category, it is coded to the higher category. Thus for an incident in which the victim was subjected to prolonged incommunicado detention without medical access in the course of an unlawful detainment, the violation would be counted under torture.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
