	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 7-2-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data availability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between the various existing data sources, primarily the IEA World Energy Balances and the UN Energy Statistics Database, annual total and renewable energy consumption for every country and area can be collected. The Tracking SDG7: The Energy Progress Report (formerly &lt;em&gt;Sustainable Energy for All Global Tracking Framework&lt;/em&gt;) is reporting this indicator at a global level between 1990 and 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time series:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2000 &amp;#x2013; present&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disaggregation of the data on consumption of renewable energy, e.g. by resource and end-use sector, could provide insights into other dimensions of the goal, such as affordability and reliability. For solar energy, it may also be of interest to disaggregate between on grid and off-grid capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
