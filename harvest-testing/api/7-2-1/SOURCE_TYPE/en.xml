	<message>The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 7-2-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data sources&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on renewable energy consumption are available through national energy balances compiled based on data collected by the International Energy Agency (for around 150 countries) and the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) for all countries. The energy balances make it possible to trace all the different sources and uses of energy at the national level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some technical assistance may be needed to improve these statistics, particularly in the case of renewable energy sources. Specialized industry surveys (e.g. on bioenergy use) or household surveys (in combination with the measurement of other indicators) would be feasible approaches to filling in data gaps (e.g. for use of firewood, off-grid solar energy). &lt;/p&gt;</data>
