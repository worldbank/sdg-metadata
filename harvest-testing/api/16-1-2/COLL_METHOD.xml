			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Data will be compiled from data providers that have been systematically assessed by OHCHR for their application of the methodology for the indicator, including their ability to provide credible and reliable data and apply the verification standard based on the technical guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms, bodies and institutions that have the mandate, capacity and independence to document and investigate alleged killings related to conflict will be prioritized. From this perspective, UN entities working on casualty recording in the framework of their operations (e.g. peacekeeping operations, commissions of inquiry, humanitarian operations and human rights offices), national human rights institutions and national statistical offices will generally be prioritized. OHCHR will conduct capacity-building activities and collaborate, including in validating data, with relevant stakeholders at national, regional and international levels. &lt;/p&gt;
