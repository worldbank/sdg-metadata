  &lt;li&gt;OHCHR will conduct a validation process of the list of situations of armed conflict to be considered for the indicator every year. OHCHR will systematically assess each potentially relevant data provider for its application of the methodology for the indicator, including its ability to provide credible and reliable data and apply verification standards. This will be done through metadata exchange, capacity building and continued exchange with data providers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</data>
