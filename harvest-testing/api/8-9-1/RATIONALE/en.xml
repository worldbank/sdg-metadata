	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 8-9-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Target 8.9 has several dimensions; this caters to the dimension: &lt;em&gt;tourism&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;promote &lt;/em&gt;[...] &lt;em&gt;tourism&lt;/em&gt;. The value of the economic contribution of tourism captured by this indicator, and (relative) increases or decreases in it, could indicate the degree to which tourism is being successfully promoted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator is useful for policy on tourism at national level and the level of sub-national regions as it gives a more inclusive measure of the economic contribution of tourism (i.e. including all forms of tourism according to International Recommendations for Tourism Statistics 2008), which can be compared to GDP contributions of other economic activities. The indicator has been found especially useful in promoting and mainstreaming tourism in policy agendas at all levels. The indicator can also be compared across countries. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
