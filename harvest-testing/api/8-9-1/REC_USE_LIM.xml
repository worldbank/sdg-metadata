			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Given that a growing number of countries produce Tourism Satellite Account (TSA), data on the suggested indicators could become available in many more countries in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data demands &amp;#x2013; among others - detailed input-output or supply and use tables for setting up a TSA; this means that it is often not possible to have current data or frequent updating of the TSA. Therefore, some countries produce estimates of TSA aggregates, in between reference years, to have more current data and to produce a time series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDGDP/GDP tends to do not show large variations from one year to the next and variations may stem from the numerator and/or denominator. This could warrant considering the indicator in different forms: absolute value, % change in constant price, and TDGDP per visitor or per employed person. &lt;/p&gt;
