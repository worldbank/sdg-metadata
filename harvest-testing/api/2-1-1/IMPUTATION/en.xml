	<message>The IMPUTATION field for indicator 2-1-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; At country level &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When no data on food consumption is available from a recent household survey, the model-based estimate of the PoU is informed by an estimate of DEC from Food Balance Sheets, an indirect estimate of CV based on information on the country&amp;#x2019;s GDP, Gini coefficient of Income, an index of the relative price of food, or other indicators of development such as country&amp;#x2019;s Under 5 Mortality Rate, and an estimate of the MDER based on the UN Population Division&amp;#x2019;s World Population Prospects data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the section on method of computation for details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; At regional and global levels &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missing values for individual countries are implicitly imputed to be equal to the population weighted average of the estimated values of the countries present in the same subregion or region.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
