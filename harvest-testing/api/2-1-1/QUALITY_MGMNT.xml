			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;ESS conducts trend analysis of the newly updated indicator with other relevant indicators. Meanwhile, preliminary estimates of each round of the update are circulated among regional offices for review. Because of their knowledge of their regions and countries, they often provide invaluable inputs to the revisions and finalization of the update. &lt;/p&gt;
