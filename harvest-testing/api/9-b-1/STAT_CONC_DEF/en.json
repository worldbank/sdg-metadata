Manufacturing sector<em> </em>is defined according to the International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 3 (1990) or Revision 4 (2008). It refers to industries belonging to sector D in revision 3 or sector C in Revision 4.</p>\n<p>Technology classification is based on research and development (R&amp;D) expenditure relative to value added otherwise referred as R&amp;D intensity. Data for R&amp;D intensity are presented in a report (Galindo-Rueda and Verger, 2016) published by the OECD in 2016, which also proposes a taxonomy for industry groups with different ranges of R&amp;D expenditure relative to their gross value added. MHT industries have traditionally been defined exclusively to manufacturing industries. However, there have been recent efforts (Galindo-Rueda and Verger, 2016) to extend the definition to non-manufacturing industries as well. Nevertheless, medium-high and high technology sectors also in new paper are primarily represented by manufacturing industries.</p>\n<p>The following table includes the classification of MHT industries by ISIC Rev. 3 and ISIC Rev. 4.</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>ISIC Rev.4</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Description</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>ISIC Rev.3 </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Description</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>20</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>24</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>21</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Manufacture of basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>29</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>252</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Manufacture of weapons and ammunition</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>30</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Manufacture of office, accounting and computing machinery</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>26</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>31</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Manufacture of electrical machinery and apparatus n.e.c.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>27</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Manufacture of electrical equipment</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>32</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Manufacture of radio, television and communication equipment and apparatus</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>28</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c.</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>33</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Manufacture of medical, precision and optical instruments, watches and clocks</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>29</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>34</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>30*</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Manufacture of other transport equipment </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>35**</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Manufacture of other transport equipment</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>325</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Manufacture of medical and dental instruments and supplies</p>\n      </td>\n      <td></td>\n      <td></td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>* </strong>Excluding 301 (Building of ships and boats)</p>\n<p><strong>** </strong>Excluding 351 (Building and repairing of ships and boats)</p>\n<p>MVA is the value added of manufacturing industry, which is Section C of ISIC Rev.4, and Section D of ISIC Rev.3. </p>"}
