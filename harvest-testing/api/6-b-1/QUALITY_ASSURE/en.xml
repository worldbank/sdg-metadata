	<message>The QUALITY_ASSURE field for indicator 6-b-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Quality assurance:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once received, the country submission undergoes a thorough data validation process, which is often an iterative process requiring communication and feedback with regional and country counterparts. Quality of the submission is also assessed through an analysis of data collected on country processes (number of ministries involved, whether a national meeting was held to support the filling of the questionnaire, stakeholder validation, use of documentation, etc.) as well as supporting documentation provided. In addition, an external validation with key informants is conducted, in which WASH experts who have not participated in the GLAAS process respond to selected questions from the survey for a specific country within their area of expertise, and agreement with country responses is evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data submitted through GLAAS are endorsed by the national government prior to submission. A form (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/entity/water_sanitation_health/monitoring/investments/glaas-consent-form-2016.doc?ua=1&quot;&gt;http://www.who.int/entity/water_sanitation_health/monitoring/investments/glaas-consent-form-2016.doc?ua=1&lt;/a&gt;) providing consent to WHO for the release and publication of the country data is signed and submitted along with the filled survey.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
