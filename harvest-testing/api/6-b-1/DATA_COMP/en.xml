	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 6-b-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Methodology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Computation method:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) questionnaire provides information on whether there are &amp;#x201C;clearly defined procedures in laws or policies for participation by service users (e.g. households) and communities in planning programs&amp;#x201D;. For countries that have data available from the local administrative unit level, they are asked to provide data on the number of local administrative units for which policies and procedures for local participation (i) exist, and (ii) are operational, as well as (iii) the number of local administrative units assessed, and (iv) the total number of units in the country. The indicator is computed as (ii) the number of local admin units with operation policies and procedures for local participation divided by (iv) the total number of local administrative units in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both numerator and denominator will be obtained through the GLAAS survey for the 2016-2017 cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
