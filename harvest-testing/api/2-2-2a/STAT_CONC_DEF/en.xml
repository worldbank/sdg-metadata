	<message>The STAT_CONC_DEF field for indicator 2-2-2a, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Concepts and definitions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definition:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prevalence of overweight (weight for height &amp;gt;+2 standard deviation from the median of the World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards) among children under 5 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official MDG indicator is overweight as assessed using weight for height. Overweight can however also be assessed with other indicators such body mass index for age. In general BMI for age is not used in the joint dataset but has been considered in absence of any other available estimates. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
