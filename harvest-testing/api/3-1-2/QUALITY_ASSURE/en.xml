&lt;p&gt;Data are reported to UNICEF on an annual basis. Values are reviewed and assess to make sure that reported indicator complies with standard definition and methodology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the country consultation, data are reported by UNICEF country office or statistical offices in country to UNICEF-HQ for global compilation. At the national levels, country offices are in touch with national authorities to compile and provide requested data, and therefore, values reported in global database are validated by national authorities. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
