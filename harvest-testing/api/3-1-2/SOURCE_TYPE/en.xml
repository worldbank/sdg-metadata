&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National-level household surveys are the main data sources used to collect data for skilled health personnel SBA. These surveys include Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS) and national surveys based on similar methodologies. The surveys are undertaken every 3 to 5 years. For mainly industrialized countries (where the coverage is high), data sources include routine service statistics.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
