&lt;p&gt;Having a skilled attendant at the time of childbirth is an important lifesaving intervention for both women and babies. Not having access to this key assistance is detrimental to women&amp;apos;s health because it could cause the death of the women or long lasting morbidity, especially in vulnerable settings.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
