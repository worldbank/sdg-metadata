	<message>The REG_AGG field for indicator 14-7-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Regional and global aggregates:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional and global aggregates will be generated by taking the average value of the indicator for countries in each SDG region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When interpreting regional aggregates, it is important to consider that a country&amp;#x2019;s geographic region is not necessarily indicative of how or where it fishes. Countries may fish in completely different fishing areas from others in their region, and therefore land-based regional aggregates can be inappropriate when dealing with marine resources.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
