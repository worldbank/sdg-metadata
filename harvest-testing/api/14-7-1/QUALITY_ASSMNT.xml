			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The indicator provides a clear framework for monitoring countries&amp;#x2019; progress towards target 14.7. Inputs are robust, standardised, globally recognised and available for a wide range of countries, including many developing nations. As such there is comprehensive coverage for the majority of countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be variation in the completeness of nationally reported data. Improvements in data collection by national statistics systems may improve the accuracy of this indicator. When regional stock status is used in the calculation of this indicator it may not fully reflect the sustainability of national fisheries.&lt;/p&gt;
