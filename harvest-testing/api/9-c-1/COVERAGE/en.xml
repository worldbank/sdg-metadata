	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 9-c-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2015, data on 2G mobile population coverage were available for about 147 countries, from developed and developing regions, and covering all key global regions. Data on 3G mobile population coverage were available for 152 countries and data on LTE mobile population coverage were available for 124 countries. ITU publishes data on this indicator yearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the data for the percentage of the population covered by a mobile network, broken down by technology, and on rural population figures, countries can produce estimates on rural and urban population coverage. ITU produces global estimates for the rural population coverage, by technology.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
