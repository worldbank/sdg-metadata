	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Regional aggregates:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global and regional estimates are produced using weighted country-level data. First, the missing country-level data are estimated using data of the dominant mobile operator. Once all the country-level percentages are available, the number of people covered by the mobile signal is calculated by multiplying the percentage of population covered by the signal to the population of the country. The regional and world total population covered by a signal were calculated by summing the country-level data. The aggregate percentages were calculated by dividing the regional totals by the population of respective groups.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
