{"status":"success","message":"The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 5-2-1, translated into en","data":"<p>A country consultation on the intimate partner violence estimates was conducted in early 2020. All countries received their country profile which included their data sources, and a technical note explaining the methodology (available in six official languages). The consultations ensured: i) countries had the opportunity to review their national modelled intimate partner violence estimate and the data sources (surveys/studies) used in the production of these estimates, ii) the identification of any additional surveys/studies that met the inclusion criteria (i.e. they were published between 2000-2018, used acts-based measures of intimate partner violence, nationally or subnationally representative) but which may not have been previously identified; and iii) familiarize countries with the statistical modelling approach used to derive the global, regional and national estimates. </p>"}
