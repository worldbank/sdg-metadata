These are also considered acts of psychological abuse </p>\n<p>For a more detailed definition of physical, sexual and psychological violence against women see <em>Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys</em> (UN, 2014), and the <em>International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes</em> ICCS (UNODC, 2015), and Violence against Women Prevalence Estimates, 2018.
