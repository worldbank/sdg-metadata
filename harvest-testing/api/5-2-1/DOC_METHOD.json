Many abused women do not report violence and those who do, tend to be the most serious cases. Therefore, administrative data are not recommended to be used as a data source for this indicator. </p>\n<p>For more information on recommended practices in production of violence against women statistics see: <em>UN Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys</em> (UN, 2014). The WHO with other co-custodians are finalizing a &#x2018;Quality checklist for surveys on intimate partner violence against women&#x2019; as a tool for strengthening country capacity in collecting and reporting high quality data on violence against women.</p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
