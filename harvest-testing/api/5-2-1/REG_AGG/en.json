Regional aggregates are weighted averages of all the countries within the region. Weights used are the population of women aged 15 to 49 from the most 2019 revision of the World Population Prospects. Where data are not available for all countries in any given region, regional aggregates may still be calculated. The number of countries included in the average is clearly indicated.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that regional and global figures should be interpreted with caution, as they do not necessarily represent with accuracy the region or world as a whole, especially for regions where population coverage is below 50 per cent. </p>\n<p>Custodian agencies, in consultation with Member States, have produced-to-date global, regional and country estimates, enhancing the quality and accuracy of 5.2.1 reporting and addressing the comparability challenges outlined above. These n ew regional and global estimates (2018) are included in this round and form a baseline for monitoring of progress.</p>"}
