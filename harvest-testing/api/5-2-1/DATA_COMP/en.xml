	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 5-2-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;This indicator calls for breakdown by form of violence and by age group. Countries are encouraged to compute prevalence data for each form of violence as detailed below to assist comparability at the regional and global levels: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;1. Physical intimate partner violence: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number of ever-partnered women (aged 15 years and above) who experience physical violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) in the population multiplied by 100 .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;2. Sexual intimate partner violence: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number of ever-partnered women (aged 15 years and above) who experience sexual violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women (aged 15 years and above) in the population multiplied by 100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;3. Psychological intimate partner violence: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number of ever-partnered women (aged 15 years and above) who experience psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women (aged 15 years and above) multiplied by 100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;4. Any form of physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number of ever-partnered women (aged 15 years and above) who experience physical and/or sexual violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women (aged 15 years and above) multiplied by 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;5. Any form of physical, sexual and/or psychological intimate partner violence:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number of ever-partnered women (aged 15 years and above) who experience physical, sexual and/or psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women (aged 15 years and above) multiplied by 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;NOTE: To assist comparability at the regional and global level, and due to more comparable data available, countries are encouraged to &lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;additionally&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;u&gt; compute the above figures for ever-partnered &lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;women aged 15 to 49&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;u&gt;. Regional and global reporting on this indicator currently only includes data computed by countries for #4 above (i.e., &lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;any form of physical and/or sexual partner violence)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;u&gt;, and for both the 15-49 and the 15 years and older age groups). For further details, see Feasibility section above. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</data>
