	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 5-2-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All available survey data sources that are representative at the national and subnational level, are used to generate the prevalence estimates. The data are from published survey reports and/or data and datasets provided by countries. In cases where only data disaggregated by violence type were presented in the report, microdata was used to calculate the aggregate measure of physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence. As there is variability in the measurement across surveys and countries, relevant covariate adjustments were made to enhance comparability. These include adjustments for case definitions (e.g. severity), type of violence (i.e. physical intimate partner violence only or sexual intimate partner violence only), population surveyed (e.g. currently married women only or all women), reference partners (e.g. current/most recent partners), and geographical strata (rural or urban), aggregate measure of physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence where only one of the two forms were available.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
