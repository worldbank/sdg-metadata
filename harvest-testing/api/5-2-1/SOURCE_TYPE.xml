			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The SDG 5.2.1 Indicator Database comprises data from population-based household surveys representative at the national and/or sub-national level and implementing a methodology that uses act-based questions. All sources date from 2000 onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant proportion of data, especially for low- and middle-income countries are obtained from the Domestic Violence Module Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Some data come from dedicated surveys on violence against women in countries that have implemented, for example, WHO&amp;#x2019;s violence against women survey methodology or other methodologies consistent with international guidelines and best practice. In the case of some higher-income countries, data were also obtained from Crime Victimisation Surveys (CVS).&lt;/p&gt;
