&lt;p&gt;Proportion of women aged 15-49 years (married or in union) who make their own decision on all three selected areas i.e. decide on their own health care; decide on use of contraception; and can say no to sexual intercourse with their husband or partner if they do not want. Only women who provide a &amp;#x201C;yes&amp;#x201D; answer to all three components are considered as women who make their own decisions regarding sexual and reproductive health. A union involves a man and a woman regularly cohabiting in a marriage-like relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women&amp;#x2019;s autonomy in decision-making and exercise of their reproductive rights is assessed from responses to the following three questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Who usually makes decisions about health care for yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2013; RESPONDENT &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2013; HUSBAND/PARTNER&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2013; RESPONDENT AND HUSBAND/PARTNER JOINTLY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2013; SOMEONE ELSE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2013; OTHER SPECIFY &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Who usually makes the decision on whether or not you should use contraception? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2013; RESPONDENT &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2013; HUSBAND/PARTNER &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2013; RESPONDENT AND HUSBAND/PARTNER JOINTLY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2013; SOMEONE ELSE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2013; OTHER SPECIFY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Can you say no to your husband/partner if you do not want to have sexual intercourse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2013; YES &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2013; NO &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2013; DEPENDS/NOT SURE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman is considered to have autonomy in reproductive health decision making and to be empowered to exercise their reproductive rights if they (1) decide on health care for themselves, either alone or jointly with their husbands or partners, (2) decide on use or non-use of contraception, either alone or jointly with their husbands or partners; and (3) can say no to sex with their husband/partner if they do not want to.&lt;/p&gt;
