{"status":"success","message":"The STAT_CONC_DEF field for indicator 16-8-1, translated into en","data":"<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>\n<p>The proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international organizations has two components, the developing country proportion of voting rights and the developing country proportion of membership in international organisations. In some institutions these two components are identical.</p>\n<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>\n<p>The indicator is calculated independently for eleven different international institutions: The United Nations General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Finance Corporation, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Trade Organisation, and the Financial Stability Board.</p>\n<p>There is no established convention for the designation of &quot;developed&quot; and &quot;developing&quot; countries or areas in the United Nations system. In common practice, Japan in Asia, Canada and the United States in northern America, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania, and Europe are considered &quot;developed&quot; regions or areas. The aggregation across all institutions is currently done according to the United Nations M.49 statistical standard which includes designation of &#x201C;developed regions&#x201D; and &#x201C;developing regions&#x201D;, while an ongoing review seeks to reach agreement on how to define these terms for the purposes of SDG monitoring. The designations &quot;developed&quot; and developing&quot; are intended for statistical convenience and do not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the development process.</p>"}
