To maximize the data for robust estimates, as well as to reduce duplication of data collection to avoid further data reporting burden on countries, complementary data are used from various databases.</p><h2>Collection process:</h2>\n<p>WHO conducts a formal country consultation process before releasing its cause-of-death estimates.</p><h1>Calendar</h1>\n<h2>Data collection:</h2>\n<p>Ongoing </p><h2>Data release:</h2>\n<p>2017, first quarter </p><h1>Data providers</h1>\n<p>National statistics offices, Various line ministries and databases covering civil registration with complete coverage and medical certification of cause of death.</p><h1>Data compilers</h1>\n<p>WHO</p><h2>Rationale:</h2>\n<p>The indicator expresses the number of deaths from inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene (with focus on WASH services) which could be prevented by improving those services and practices. It is based on both the WASH service provision in the country, as well as the related health outcomes, and therefore provides important information on the actual disease caused by the risks measured in 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3.</p><h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n<p>Data rely on (a) statistics on WASH services (6.1, 6.2 and 6.3), which are well assessed in almost all countries, and (b) data on deaths. Data on deaths are also widely available from countries from death registration data or sample registration systems, which are certainly feasible systems. Such data are crucial for improving health and reducing preventable deaths in countries. The main limitation is that not all countries do have such registration systems to date, and data need to be completed with other type of information.</p><h1>Methodology</h1>\n<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n<p>The methods with agreed international standard have been developed, reviewed and published in various documents:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/gbd_poor_water/en/\">http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/gbd_poor_water/en/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4255749/\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4255749/</a></p><h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Data are available for practically all countries. They are, however, sometimes based on health statistics provided by international agencies as the national data are incomplete, which have been interpolated/ extrapolated, adjusted, and completed by additional data and cause-of-death models.

Data also exists for age group and sex. Similar to JMP&#x2019;s work on disaggregation by income groups (wealth quintile), data can further be disaggregated by wealth quintile.</p><h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>\n<p>WHO is required by World Health Assembly resolution to consult on all WHO statistics, and seek feedback from countries on data about countries and territories. Before publishing, all estimates undergo country consultations.</p><h1>References</h1>\n<h2>URL:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/gbd_poor_water/en/\">http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/gbd_poor_water/en/</a></p>\n<h2>References:</h2>\n<p>1.
