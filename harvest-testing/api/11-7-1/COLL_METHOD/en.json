At the Global level, data will be assembled and compiled for international consumption and comparison by UN-Habitat and other partners. UN-Habitat and partners will explore several capacity building options to ensure that uniform standards for generation, reporting and analysing data for this indicator are applied by all countries and regions.</p>\n<p>Validation of data on potential open public spaces, which are mapped from high resolution imagery or compiled from open sources (see method of computation section) requires ground truthing. UN-Habitat has developed a set of questions, which can be administered through mobile device-based applications such as KoboToolbox. The questions are available on this tool: https://ee.kobotoolbox.org/x/#IGFf6ubq</p>"}
