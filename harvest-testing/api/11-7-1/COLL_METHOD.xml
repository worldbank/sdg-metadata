			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Data collection is supposed to be done at the local city/urban level, with national aggregates made from all cities in the country, or from a sample of representative cities (selected using the National Sample of Cities Approach developed by UN-Habitat: &lt;a href=&quot;https://unhabitat.org/sites/default/files/2020/06/national_sample_of_cities_english.pdf&quot;&gt;https://unhabitat.org/sites/default/files/2020/06/national_sample_of_cities_english.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ). At the Global level, data will be assembled and compiled for international consumption and comparison by UN-Habitat and other partners. UN-Habitat and partners will explore several capacity building options to ensure that uniform standards for generation, reporting and analysing data for this indicator are applied by all countries and regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Validation of data on potential open public spaces, which are mapped from high resolution imagery or compiled from open sources (see method of computation section) requires ground truthing. UN-Habitat has developed a set of questions, which can be administered through mobile device-based applications such as KoboToolbox. The questions are available on this tool: https://ee.kobotoolbox.org/x/#IGFf6ubq&lt;/p&gt;
