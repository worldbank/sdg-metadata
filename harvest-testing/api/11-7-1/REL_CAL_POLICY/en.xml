	<message>The REL_CAL_POLICY field for indicator 11-7-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data for indicator 11.7.1 will be released on an annual basis, to cater for an anticipated increase in the number of cities/urban areas and countries reporting on the indicator. Changes in trends within individual cities and/or countries are likely to happen in spans of about 3-5 years, so a three-year window will be applied for comprehensive review of all data, with updates made based on availability of new data.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
