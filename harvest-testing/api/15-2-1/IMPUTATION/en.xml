	<message>The IMPUTATION field for indicator 15-2-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At country level &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For countries and territories where no information was provided to FAO for FRA 2020 (47 countries and territories representing 0.5 percent of the global forest area), a report was prepared by FAO using existing information from previous assessments, literature search, remote sensing or a combination of two or more of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the above-ground biomass sub-indicator, imputation of the missing values has been carried out by FAO for those countries with at least one data point in the time series. The value of the data point closest in time was used as imputed value. For those countries where no value was reported for any of the reporting years, no imputation was done and the values for all years were set as &amp;#x201C;Not Available&amp;#x201D;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At regional and global levels &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See above. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
