	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Quality assurance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once received, the country reports undergo a rigorous review process to ensure correct use of definitions and methodology as well as internal consistency. A comparison is made with past assessments and other existing data sources. Regular contacts between national correspondents and FAO staff by e-mail and regional/sub-regional review workshops form part of this review process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All country reports (including those prepared by FAO) are sent to the respective Head of Forestry for validation before finalization and publishing of data. The data are then aggregated at sub-regional, regional and global levels by the FRA team at FAO. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
