	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Comments and limitations: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five sub-indicators chosen to illustrate progress towards sustainable forest management do not fully cover all aspects of sustainable forest management. In particular, social and economic aspects are summarized under the sub-indicators on areas under sustainable forest management plans. Furthermore, as the trends are calculated using only those countries which have data complete time series, different sub-indicators may reflect different sets of countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the dashboard illustrates the progress on the individual sub-indicators, there is no weighting of the relative importance of the sub-indicators. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
