	<data>&lt;p&gt;Sub-indicators 1 to 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data are collected by FAO through the Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA). Assessments have been carried out at regular intervals since 1946 and are now produced every five year. The latest of these assessments, FRA 2020, contains information for 236 countries and territories on about 60 variables related to the extent of forests, their conditions, uses and values for several points in time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sub-indicator 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, forest certification by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) are included in the data submissions. The latter includes several national/regional certification schemes that have been endorsed according to the PEFC standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on forest certification are submitted annually to FAO by the head offices of the respective forest certification scheme. Data include the area certified by each scheme, as well as areas that are double-certified by the two schemes. That allows for estimating the total certified forest area, adjusted for double certified area. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
