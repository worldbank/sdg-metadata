{"status":"success","message":"The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 3-7-2, translated into en","data":"<p>The Population Division maintains a database on fertility rates from different sources including estimates produced by National Statistical Offices and regional statistical units. Data since the last round of SDG reporting are updated from various sources up to a specified cut-off date&#x2014;usually by the end of January of the reporting year. Newly available demographic data are subjected to quality analyses and evaluated by examining the consistency in the patterns, levels and trends of the data within and across countries and regions. The Population Division has often reached out to the United Population Fund (UNFPA) to request its country offices to assist in obtaining data that might be available but not yet published. Also, through the UNFPA, data that the Population Division deems questionable are verified by the National Statistics Office or other relevant government agency. The process of data compilation and selection for SDG reporting is available at: https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/unpd-egm-fer-2020-10-backgroundpaper_newtitle_final_oct9.pdf</p>"}
