Data since the last round of SDG reporting are updated from various sources up to a specified cut-off date&#x2014;usually by the end of January of the reporting year. With each revision of World Population Prospects (WPP), the Population Division carries out a re-estimation of historical demographic trends for countries and territories of the world. These demographic estimates are based on the most recently available data sources, such as censuses, demographic surveys, registries of vital events, population registers and various other sources. Newly available demographic data and information are subjected to quality analyses and evaluated by examining the consistency in the patterns, levels and trends of the data across countries and regions. The description of the guidelines for managing the quality of the data and process is available at: https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/unpd-egm-fer-2020-10-backgroundpaper_newtitle_final_oct9.pdf; https://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2019_Methodology.pdf. </p>"}
