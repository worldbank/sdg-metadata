{"status":"success","message":"The DATA_COMP field for indicator 3-7-2, translated into en","data":"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n<p>The adolescent birth rate is computed as a ratio. The numerator is the number of live births to women aged 15-19 years, and the denominator an estimate of exposure to childbearing by women aged 15-19 years. The computation is the same for the age group 10-14 years. The numerator and the denominator are calculated differently for civil registration, survey and census data.</p>\n<p>In the case of civil registration data, the numerator is the registered number of live births born to women aged 15-19 years during a given year, and the denominator is the estimated or enumerated population of women aged 15-19 years.</p>\n<p>In the case of survey data, the numerator is the number of live births obtained from retrospective birth histories of the interviewed women who were 15-19 years of age at the time of the births during a reference period before the interview, and the denominator is person-years lived between the ages of 15 and 19 years by the interviewed women during the same reference period. The reported observation year corresponds to the middle of the reference period. For some surveys without data on retrospective birth histories, computation of the adolescent birth rate is based on the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the survey.</p>\n<p>With census data, the adolescent birth rate is computed on the basis of the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the enumeration. The census provides both the numerator and the denominator for the rates. In some cases, the rates based on censuses are adjusted for under-registration based on indirect methods of estimation. For some countries with no other reliable data, the own-children method of indirect estimation provides estimates of the adolescent birth rate for a number of years before the census.</p>\n<p>If data are available, adolescent fertility at ages 10-14 years can also be computed.</p>\n<p>For a thorough treatment of the different methods of computation, see <em>Handbook on the Collection of Fertility and Mortality Data, United Nations Publication, Sales No. E.03.XVII.11</em> (publicly accessible at <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/SeriesF/SeriesF_92E.pdf%20\">http://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/SeriesF/SeriesF_92E.pdf</a>).
