	<message>The SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS field for indicator 3-7-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Related indicators&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicator is linked to Target 5.6 (Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights as agreed in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences) because reductions in adolescent childbearing that can be brought about by increasing access to sexual and reproductive health-care services are also reflective of improvements in sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights per se. Indicator is linked to Target 17.19 (By 2030 build on existing initiatives to develop measurements of progress on sustainable development that complement gross domestic product and support statistical capacity-building in developing countries) because the adolescent birth rate draws on in part birth registration and census data. Strengthened civil registration and vital statistics systems in countries that can reach 100 per cent registration coverage of births and timeliness of census data are relevant for measuring progress on target 3.7.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
