	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data sources&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description of sources and collection process:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data can be collected using the Food Insecurity Experience Scale survey module (FIES-SM) developed by FAO, or any other experience-based food security scale questionnaires, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM) developed by the Economic Research Service of the US Department of Agriculture, and used in the US and Canada, &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Latin American and Caribbean Food Security Scale (or Escala Latinoamericana y Caribe&amp;#xF1;a de Seguridad Alimentaria &amp;#x2013; ELCSA), used in Guatemala and tested in several other Spanish speaking countries in Latin America, &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Mexican Food Security Scale (or Escala Mexicana de Seguridad Alimentaria, - EMSA), an adaptation of the ELCSA used in Mexico, &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale (Escala Brasileira de medida de la Inseguran&amp;#xE7;a Alimentar &amp;#x2013; EBIA) used in Brazil, or &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS), &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;or any adaptation of the above that can be calibrated against the global FIES.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two versions of the FIES-SM are available for use in surveys of individuals or households respectively, and the difference stands in whether respondents are asked to report only on their individual experiences, or also on that of other member of the household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current FIES-SM module include eight questions as in the table below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;GLOBAL FOOD INSECURITY EXPERIENCE SCALE&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now I would like to ask you some questions about food. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Q1. During the last 12 MONTHS, was there a time when you (or any other adult in the household) were worried you would not have enough food to eat because of a lack of money or other resources?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;0 No&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;1 Yes&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;98 Don&amp;#x2019;t Know&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;99 Refused&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Q2. Still thinking about the last 12 MONTHS, was there a time when you (or any other adult in the household) were unable to eat healthy and nutritious food because of a lack of money or other resources? &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;0 No&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;1 Yes&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;98 Don&amp;#x2019;t Know&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;99 Refused&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Q3. And was there a time when you (or any other adult in the household) ate only a few kinds of foods because of a lack of money or other resources? &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;0 No&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;1 Yes&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;98 Don&amp;#x2019;t Know&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;99 Refused&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Q4. Was there a time when you (or any other adult in the household) had to skip a meal because there was not enough money or other resources to get food?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;0 No&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;1 Yes&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;98 Don&amp;#x2019;t Know&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;99 Refused&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Q5. Still thinking about the last 12 MONTHS, was there a time when you (or any other adult in the household) ate less than you thought you should because of a lack of money or other resources?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;0 No&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;1 Yes&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;98 Don&amp;#x2019;t Know&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;99 Refused&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Q6. And was there a time when your household ran out of food because of a lack of money or other resources?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;0 No&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;1 Yes&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;98 Don&amp;#x2019;t Know&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;99 Refused&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Q7. Was there a time when you (or any other adult in the household) were hungry but did not eat because there was not enough money or other resources for food?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;0 No&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;1 Yes&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;98 Don&amp;#x2019;t Know&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;99 Refused&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Q8. Finally, was there a time when you (or any other adult in the household) went without eating for a whole day because of a lack of money or other resources?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;0 No&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;1 Yes&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;98 Don&amp;#x2019;t Know&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;99 Refused&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions should be adapted and administered in the respondents&amp;#x2019; preferred language and enumerators instructed to make sure that respondents recognize the reference period and the qualifier according to which experiences should be reported only when due to &amp;#x201C;lack of money or other resources&amp;#x201D; and not, for example, for reasons related to health or other cultural habits (such as fasting for religious credos).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FIES-SM can be included in virtually any telephone-based or personal interview based survey of the population, though face to face interview is preferred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2014, the individual referenced FIES-SM is applied to nationally representative samples of the population aged 15 or more in all countries covered by the Gallup World Poll (more than 140 countries every year, covering 90% of the world population). In most countries samples include about 1000 individuals (with larger samples of 3000 individuals in India and 5000 in mainland China).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other national surveys exist that already collect FIES compatible data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Burkina Faso, the FIES was included in the 2014 round of ENQUETE MULTISECTORIELLE CONTINUE (EMC-BF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Cabo Verde, the FIES was included in the 2018 round of INQU&amp;#xC9;RITO NACIONAL DE VULNERABILIDADE ALIMENTAR E NUTRICIONAL DAS FAM&amp;#xCD;LIAS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Canada, Canadian Health Food Security Scale was included by Statistics Canada in the 2015 round of Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chile, FIES was included in the 2017 round of Encuesta de Caracterizaci&amp;#xF3;n Socioecon&amp;#xF3;mica Nacional (Casen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ecuador, FIES was included in the 2016 round of the GESTI&amp;#xD3;N DE ESTAD&amp;#xCD;STICAS PERMANENTES A HOGARES (GEPH-ENEMDU).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ghana, the FIES was included in the 2016-17 round of Living Standards Survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Indonesia, FIES is regularly collected every year since 2017 through National Socio-Economic Survey (SUSENAS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Israel, HFSSM was collected in the 2016 round of the Food Security Survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kenya, the FIES was included in the 2015-16 round of Integrated Household Budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Malawi, the FIES was included in the 2016-17 round of FOURTH INTEGRATED HOUSEHOLD SURVEY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Nigeria, the FIES was included in the 2015 round of GENERAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY-PANEL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Palestine, FIES was included in the 2018 round of the Socio-economic Monitoring of the Palestinian Households&amp;#x2019; Survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Republic of Korea, the Korean translation of the HFSSM was included in the 2014 and 2015 rounds of the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Russian Federation, FIES was collected in the 2018 round of Nutrition sample survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Saint Lucia, FIES data were collected in the Survey of Living Conditions and Household Budgets 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Seychelles, FIES data were collected in the Quarterly Labour Force Survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, the HFSSM is included every year in the Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement (CPS-FSS) by the US Bureau of Census since 1995. (The CPS-FSS reached about 83,000 individuals aged 15 or more in about 42,000 households in 2014.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obtaining internationally comparable data for global monitoring:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure comparability of the FImod+sev and FIsev indicators computed for different populations, universal thresholds are defined on the FIES global reference scale and converted into corresponding values on the &amp;#x201C;local&amp;#x201D; scales obtained as a result of application of the Rasch model on any specific population, through a process of &amp;#x201C;equating&amp;#x201D;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equating is a form of standardization of the metric based on identification of the subset of items that can be considered common to the global FIES and the specific scale used for measurement in each context. The severity levels associated with the common items are used as anchoring points to adjust the global FIES thresholds to the local scales. The standardization process ensures that the mean and standard deviation of the set of common items is the same when measured on the global FIES or on the national scale. Compatibility with the global FIES and the possibility to compile this indicator requires that at least four of the eight FIES items are identified as common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Statistics Division at FAO has developed the RM.weights package under R, which provides routines for estimating the parameters of the Rasch model using conditional maximum likelihood, with the possibility to allow for the complex survey design.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
