(The CPS-FSS reached about 83,000 individuals aged 15 or more in about 42,000 households in 2014.)</p>\n<p><strong>Obtaining internationally comparable data for global monitoring:</strong></p>\n<p>To ensure comparability of the FImod+sev and FIsev indicators computed for different populations, universal thresholds are defined on the FIES global reference scale and converted into corresponding values on the &#x201C;local&#x201D; scales obtained as a result of application of the Rasch model on any specific population, through a process of &#x201C;equating&#x201D;.</p>\n<p>Equating is a form of standardization of the metric based on identification of the subset of items that can be considered common to the global FIES and the specific scale used for measurement in each context. The severity levels associated with the common items are used as anchoring points to adjust the global FIES thresholds to the local scales. The standardization process ensures that the mean and standard deviation of the set of common items is the same when measured on the global FIES or on the national scale. Compatibility with the global FIES and the possibility to compile this indicator requires that at least four of the eight FIES items are identified as common.</p>\n<p>The Statistics Division at FAO has developed the RM.weights package under R, which provides routines for estimating the parameters of the Rasch model using conditional maximum likelihood, with the possibility to allow for the complex survey design.</p>"}
