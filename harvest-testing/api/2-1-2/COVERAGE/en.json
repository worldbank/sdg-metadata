provided.</p>\n<h2>Disaggregation:</h2>\n<p>As the FIES or any other compatible experience-based food security questionnaire is applied through surveys, the prevalence of food insecurity can be measured in any population group for which the survey used to collect data is representative.</p>\n<p>If applied at household level, disaggregation is thus possible based on household characteristics such as location, household income, composition (including for example presence and number of small children, members with disabilities, elderly members, etc.), sex, age and education of the household head, etc. If applied at the individual level, proper disaggregation of the prevalence of food insecurity by sex is possible as the prevalence of food insecurity among male and among female members of the same population group can be measured independently.</p>\n<p>When producing disaggregated statistics, attention must be devoted to verifying the validity of the application by estimating the Rasch model with the data from each specific subpopulation group and, if necessary, perform the appropriate equating of the measure before comparing results.</p>\n<p>It is good practice to associate a measure of variability (margins of error or upper and lower bound) when disaggregated data are produced.</p>"}
