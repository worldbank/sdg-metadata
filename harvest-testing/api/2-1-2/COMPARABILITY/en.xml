	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the few cases where indicators of food insecurity based on experience-based food security scales have been reported by countries (U.S., Canada, Mexico, Guatemala and Brazil), these have been based on nationally set thresholds that do not correspond to the international thresholds proposed by the FIES. See Annex I and Table A3 in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/3/i4830e.pdf%20&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/3/i4830e.pdf&lt;/a&gt; for a description of the differences. In the future, it is desirable that country would start reporting prevalence estimates using also the internationally set thresholds for moderate or severe and severe levels, in addition to those based on national thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAO is ready to provide assistance on the analytic methods needed to estimate prevalence based on the FIES global reference thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
