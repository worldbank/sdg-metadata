	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 3-c-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Health worker densities by occupation&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figures for number of medical doctors (including generalist and specialist medical practitioners) depending on the nature of the original data source may include practising medical doctors only or all registered medical doctors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figures for number of nursing and midwifery include nursing personnel and midwifery personnel, whenever available. In many countries, nurses trained with midwifery skills are counted and reported as nurses. This makes the distinction between nursing personnel and midwifery personnel difficult to draw. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figures for number of dentists include dentists in the given national and/or subnational area. Depending on the nature of the original data source may include practising (active) only or all registered in the health occupation. The ISCO -08 codes included here are 2261. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figures for number of pharmacists include in the given national and/or subnational area. Depending on the nature of the original data source may include practising (active) only or all registered in the health occupation. The ISCO -08 codes that relate to this occupation is 2262. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the denominator data for workforce density (i.e. national population estimates) are obtained from the United Nations Population Division&amp;apos;s World Population Prospects database. In cases where the official health workforce report provides density indicators instead of counts, estimates of the stock were then calculated using the population estimated from the United Nations Population Division&amp;apos;s World population prospects database (2017). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Health worker distribution by sex&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of male medical doctors as reported by the country is expressed as a percentage of total male and female medical doctors reported by the country&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of female medical doctors as reported by the country is expressed as a percentage of total male and female medical doctors reported by the country&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of male nursing personnel as reported by the country is expressed as a percentage of total male and female nursing personnel reported by the country&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of female nursing personnel as reported by the country is expressed as a percentage of total male and female nursing personnel reported by the country&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
