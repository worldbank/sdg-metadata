			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Household surveys such as DHS have been collecting data on this indicator in low- and middle-income countries since the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DHS includes a standard module that captures information on a few specific forms of sexual violence. Respondents are asked whether, at any time in their lives (as children or adults), anyone ever forced them &amp;#x2013; physically or in any other way &amp;#x2013; to have sexual intercourse or to perform any other sexual acts against their will. Those responding &amp;#x2018;yes&amp;#x2019; to this question are then asked how old they were the first time this happened. It is important to flag that the DHS module was not specifically designed to capture experiences of sexual violence in childhood and while it produces data that can be used to report on 16.2.3, further methodological work is needed to develop standard questions specifically designed to measure child sexual abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
