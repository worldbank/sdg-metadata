			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Countries gather data on childhood experiences of sexual violence through household surveys such as the Demographic and Health Surveys. In some countries, such data are also collected through other national household surveys, including dedicated surveys on violence. This indicator captures all experiences of sexual violence that occurred during childhood (i.e. prior to the age of 18 years) regardless of the legal age of consent stipulated in relevant national legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
