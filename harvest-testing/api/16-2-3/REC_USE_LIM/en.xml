	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 16-2-3, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The availability of comparable data remains a serious challenge in this area as many data collection efforts have relied on different study methodologies and designs, definitions of sexual violence, samples and questions to elicit information.
