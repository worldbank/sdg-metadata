Defining the procedures in policy or law for the participation of local communities is vital to ensure needs of all the community is met, including the most vulnerable and also encourages ownership of schemes which in turn contributes to their sustainability.</p>\n<p>Local administrative units refers to non-overlapping sub-districts, municipalities, communes, or other local community-level units covering both urban and rural areas to be defined by the government. </p>\n<p>Policies and procedures for participation of local communities in water and sanitation management would define a formal mechanism to ensure participation of users in planning water and sanitation activities. </p>\n<p>A policy or procedure is considered to be established if the mechanism for participation of local communities is defined in law or has been formally approved and published. It is considered to be operational if the policy or procedure is being implemented, with appropriate funding in place and with means for verifying that participation took place.</p>\n<p>&#x2018;Water and sanitation&#x2019; includes all areas of management related to each of the targets under SDG 6, namely: water supply (6.1), sanitation and hygiene (6.2), wastewater treatment and ambient water quality (6.3), efficiency and sustainable use (6.4), integrated water resources management (6.5) and water-related ecosystems (6.6).</p><h1>Data sources</h1>\n<h2>Description:</h2>\n<p>The UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) provides information on governance, monitoring, human resources, and financing in the water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sector. The UN-Water GLAAS survey is currently conducted on a biennial basis, led by WHO, and collected data from 94 countries (predominantly low and lower-middle income countries) in the most recent cycle in 2013-2014. The scope of the question on community and user participation has been expanded beyond WASH for the 2016-17 GLAAS cycle to address all targets in SDG 6, including water quality, water rights/allocation, water resource management, and the status of water-related ecosystems. GLAAS has completed three full cycles (2009-2010, 2011-2012, and 2013-2014), as well as a pilot conducted in 2008. </p>\n<p>National governments participating in the GLAAS survey fill out the questionnaire, preferably supported by a multi-stakeholder review. Although one ministry leads the process, it is often the case that many different ministries and departments must be involved in the process in order to obtain the data required to complete the questionnaire. A GLAAS national focal person supports the lead ministry to coordinate data collection, to compile the national response to the questionnaire, and to lead on the process of data validation.</p>\n<p>The data will be complemented by Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) reporting in SDG target 6.5 (for wastewater and water quality, water efficiency, water resource management, and the status of water-related ecosystems) (UNEP 2016). A key component of IWRM is community participation and management of water resources at the local level. The analysis of IWRM has been done in the past by UN-Water in 2008 (led by UN-DESA) and in 2012 (led by UNEP, UNDP, GWP and SIWI) as requested by the UN Commission for Sustainable Development (UN-Water 2008, 2012).</p>\n<p>The OECD Water Governance Initiative (WGI), a technical platform gathering 100+ members from the public, private and non-for-profit sectors, is currently developing a set of Water Governance Indicators, within the implementation strategy of the OECD Principles on Water Governance (OECD 2015a). The Water Governance Indicators are expected to be able to provide additional information on local participation on the basis of an indicators system proposed in OECD (2015b) for measuring &#x201C;stakeholder engagement for inclusive water governance&#x201D;. An indicator providing metrics on local participation will be developed and tested by 2017. Data will be made available through interactive platforms and databases in a format to foster policy dialogue and peer learning by 2018. A dedicated publication on &#x201C;Water Governance at a Glance&#x201D; will be launched at the 8th World Water Forum in Brasilia (2018).</p><h2>Collection process:</h2>\n<p>National governments participating in the GLAAS survey fill out the questionnaire, preferably supported by a multi-stakeholder review. Although one ministry leads the process (e.g. Ministry of Water, Ministry of Environment, etc. depending on country), it is often the case that many different ministries and departments must be involved in the process in order to obtain the data required to complete the questionnaire. A GLAAS national focal person supports the lead ministry to coordinate data collection, to compile the national response to the questionnaire, and to lead on the process of data validation. For each GLAAS submission, information on the country processes are collected (number of ministries involved, whether a national meeting was held to support the filling of the questionnaire, stakeholder validation, use of documentation, etc.) Once received, the country submission undergoes a thorough data validation process, which is often an iterative process requiring communication and feedback with regional and country counterparts.</p>\n<p>Countries are also requested to provide consent to publish individual, validated data responses as supplied to GLAAS. Thus through the data collection, validation and consultation processes, the results are expected to be comparable and no further adjustments are foreseen.</p><h1>Calendar</h1>\n<h2>Data collection:</h2>\n<p>The current round of UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) has been launched and data will be available by end-2016. (From NA to NA)</p><h2>Data release:</h2>\n<p>Q1 2017 </p><h1>Data providers</h1>\n<h2>Description:</h2>\n<p>Ministries with responsibilities related to water supply and sanitation, agriculture, water resources development and management, and environment</p><h1>Data compilers</h1>\n<h2>Name:</h2>\n<p>WHO, OECD and UNEP</p>\n<h2>Description:</h2>\n<p>WHO, with support from OECD and UNEP</p><h2>Rationale:</h2>\n<p>Defining the procedures in policy or law for the participation of local communities is vital to ensure the needs of all the community are met, including the most vulnerable and also encourages ownership of schemes which in turn contributes to their sustainability.</p>\n<p>A low value of this indicator would suggest that participation of local communities in water and sanitation management is low, whereas a high value would indicate high levels of participation, indicating greater ownership and a higher likelihood of sustainable delivery and management of water and sanitation services.</p><h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n<p>Data on local administrative units with established and operational policies and procedures for local participation is being collected through the current cycle of GLAAS, and will be available by end-2016. Until then, the presence of policies and procedures as reported at the national level for different subsectors will be reported.</p>\n<p>Additional data, including data measuring local participation from the OECD Water Governance Indicators and administrative data, will be progressively included in the calculation of the indicator as they become available.</p><h1>Methodology</h1>\n<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n<p>The UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) questionnaire provides information on whether there are &#x201C;clearly defined procedures in laws or policies for participation by service users (e.g. households) and communities in planning programs&#x201D;. For countries that have data available from the local administrative unit level, they are asked to provide data on the number of local administrative units for which policies and procedures for local participation (i) exist, and (ii) are operational, as well as (iii) the number of local administrative units assessed, and (iv) the total number of units in the country. The indicator is computed as (ii) the number of local admin units with operation policies and procedures for local participation divided by (iv) the total number of local administrative units in the country.</p>\n<p>Both numerator and denominator will be obtained through the GLAAS survey for the 2016-2017 cycle.</p><h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Due to the highly country- and context-specific nature of the indicator, no estimates are produced for countries that are missing data.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>At regional and global levels:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Operational mechanism by which individuals and communities can meaningfully contribute to water and sanitation management then the country will be excluded from the regional and global estimates for this indicator. </p>\n<p>Global and regional estimates for a related indicator on the presence and use of participation policies and procedures at the national level for different water subsectors are also derived to support the target indicator. Similarly, countries with missing values are excluded from global and regional analysis for this indicator.</p><h2>Regional aggregates:</h2>\n<p>For global and regional aggregates, the percentage of local administrative units that have a defined and operational mechanism by which individuals and communities can meaningfully contribute to decisions and directions about water and sanitation management will be averaged among countries, with each country&#x2019;s percent value weighted based on total country population for the data year, as a proportion of the global population.</p><h2>Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level:</h2>\n<p>National governments participating in GLAAS fill out the country survey, preferably supported by a multi-stakeholder review. Although one ministry leads the process, it is often the case that many different ministries and departments must be involved in the process in order to obtain the data required to complete the questionnaire.

L'enquête GLAAS d'ONU-Eau est actuellement menée sur une base biennale, sous la direction de l'OMS, et a recueilli des données dans 94 pays (principalement des pays à revenu faible et moyen inférieur) au cours du cycle le plus récent, en 2013-2014. La portée de la question sur la participation des communautés et des utilisateurs a été élargie au-delà de l'enquête WASH pour le cycle GLAAS 2016-17 afin de couvrir tous les objectifs du ODD 6, notamment la qualité de l'eau, les droits/allocations d'eau, la gestion des ressources en eau et l'état des écosystèmes liés à l'eau.

Un élément clé de la GIRE est la participation communautaire et la gestion des ressources en eau au niveau local. L'analyse de la GIRE a été effectuée dans le passé par l'ONU-Eau en 2008 (sous la direction du DAES) et en 2012 (sous la direction du PNUE, du PNUD, du GWP et du SIWI) à la demande de la Commission du développement durable des Nations unies (ONU-Eau 2008, 2012). </p>\n<p>L'Initiative de l'OCDE sur la gouvernance de l'eau (WGI), une plateforme technique réunissant plus de 100 membres des secteurs public, privé et à but non lucratif, élabore actuellement un ensemble d'indicateurs sur la gouvernance de l'eau, dans le cadre de la stratégie de mise en œuvre des Principes de l'OCDE sur la gouvernance de l'eau (OCDE 2015a). Les indicateurs de gouvernance de l'eau devraient pouvoir fournir des informations supplémentaires sur la participation locale sur la base d'un système d'indicateurs proposé dans l'OCDE (2015b) pour mesurer &#x201C; l'engagement des parties prenantes pour une gouvernance inclusive de l'eau &#x201D;. Un indicateur fournissant des mesures sur la participation locale sera développé et testé d'ici 2017. Les données seront mises à disposition par le biais de plateformes interactives et de bases de données dans un format permettant de favoriser le dialogue politique et l'apprentissage par les pairs d'ici 2018.

Обследование «ООН – Водные ресурсы» ГЛААС в настоящее время проводится раз в два года под руководством ВОЗ и собирает данные из 94 стран (преимущественно стран с низким уровнем дохода и уровнем дохода ниже среднего) за недавно проведенный цикл 2013–2014 годов. Охват вопроса об участии сообщества и пользователей был расширен за пределы ВСГ для цикла ГЛААС 2016-17 годов, чтобы охватить все задачи ЦУР 6, включая качество воды, права / распределение воды, управление водными ресурсами и статус связанных с водой экосистем. Процесс ГЛААС завершил три полных цикла (2009-2010, 2011-2012 и 2013-2014 годы), а также пилотный проект, проведенный в 2008 году. </p>\n<p> Национальные правительства, участвующие в обследовании ГЛААС, заполняют вопросник, желательно при поддержке широкого круга заинтересованных сторон.

Ключевым компонентом КУВР является участие сообщества и управление водными ресурсами на местном уровне. Анализ КУВР был осуществлен в прошлом раунде обследования «ООН-Водные ресурсы» в 2008 году (проводился под руководством ООН-ДЭСВ) и в 2012 году (проводился под руководством ЮНЕП, ПРООН, ГВП и Стокгольмского международного института водных ресурсов (SIWI)) по запросу Комиссии ООН по устойчивому развитию (ООН-Водные ресурсы за 2008, 2012 годы). </p>\n<p> Инициатива ОЭСР по руководству водными ресурсами (ИРВР), техническая платформа, объединяющая более 100 членов из государственного, частного и некоммерческого секторов, в настоящее время разрабатывает набор показателей руководства водными ресурсами в рамках стратегии реализации Принципов ОЭСР по руководству водными ресурсами (ОЭСР 2015a). Ожидается, что показатели руководства водными ресурсами смогут предоставить дополнительную информацию об участии местного населения на основе системы показателей, предложенной в ОЭСР (2015b) для оценки «взаимодействия заинтересованных сторон для инклюзивного руководства водными ресурсами». К 2017 году будет разработан и апробирован показатель, обеспечивающий критерии участия на местном уровне. К 2018 году данные будут доступны с помощью интерактивных платформ и баз данных в формате, способствующем развитию стратегического диалога и взаимного обучения. На 8-м Всемирном форуме по водным ресурсам в Бразилиа (2018 год) будет дан старт выпуску специальной публикации \"Краткий обзор вопросов руководства водными ресурсами\".</p><h2> Процесс сбора: </h2>\n<p>Национальные правительства, участвующие в обследовании ГЛААС, проводят заполнение вопросника, которое желательно совмещать с проверкой при участии многих заинтересованных сторон.

Национальный координатор ГЛААС оказывает помощь ведущему министерству в координации сбора данных, в составлении национального ответа на вопросник и в руководстве процессом валидации данных. Для каждого представления данных для ГЛААС собирается информация о процессах в стране (количество задействованных министерств, проводилось ли национальное совещание для помощи в заполнении вопросника, валидация заинтересованными сторонами, использование документации и т. д.). После получения ответа от страны осуществляется тщательный процесс валидации данных, который часто является повторяющимся процессом, требующим взаимодействия и обратной связи с региональными и страновыми партнерами. </p>\n<p> Странам также предлагается дать согласие на публикацию отдельных подтвержденных данных, представленных в ГЛААС.
