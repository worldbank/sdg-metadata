Member countries reaffirmed this mandate in 2000. Within the FAO&apos;s statistical program of work, member countries endorsed the development of an investment statistics domain, including ongoing work on government expenditure on agriculture, during meetings of three statutory bodies: the Asia and Pacific Commission on Agricultural Statistics (APCAS) held in Vietnam in February 2014; the African Commission on Agricultural Statistics (AFCAS) held in Morocco in December 2013; and the IICA working group on agricultural and livestock statistics for Latin America and the Caribbean, held in Trinidad and Tobago in June 2013. </p>"}
