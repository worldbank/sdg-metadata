For the denominator, national accounts data typically do not provide any standard error or confidence interval information.</p>\n<p>The key limitation with this indicator is that it takes into account only central government expenditure. To the extent that some countries may have heavier intervention in agriculture by sub-national governments, this will not be taken into account.</p>"}
