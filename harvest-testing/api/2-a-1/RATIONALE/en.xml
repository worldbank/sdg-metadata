	<data>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rationale:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI) greater than 1 reflects a higher orientation towards the agriculture sector, which receives a higher share of government spending relative to its contribution to economic value-added. An AOI less than 1 reflects a lower orientation to agriculture, while an AOI equal to 1 reflects neutrality in a government&amp;#x2019;s orientation to the agriculture sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government spending in agriculture includes spending on sector policies and programs; soil improvement and soil degradation control; irrigation and reservoirs for agricultural use; animal health management, livestock research and training in animal husbandry; marine/freshwater biological research; afforestation and other forestry projects; etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending in these agricultural activities helps to increase sector efficiency, productivity and income growth by increasing physical or human capital and /or reducing inter-temporal budget constraints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the private sector typically under-invests in these activities due to the presence of market failure (e.g. the public good nature of research and development; the positive externalities from improved soil and water conditions; lack of access to competitive credit due to asymmetric information between producers and financial institutions, etc.). Similarly, the high risk faced by agricultural producers, particular smallholders unable to hedge against risk, often requires government intervention in terms of income redistribution to support smallholders in distress following crop failures and livestock loss from pests, droughts, floods, infrastructure failure, or severe price changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government spending in agriculture is essential to address these market failures and the periodic need for income redistribution. This leads to several potential indicators for the SDGs, which include: a) the level of Government Expenditure on Agriculture (GEA); b) the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure, and c) the AOI for Government Expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An indicator that measures GEA levels fails to take into account the size of an economy. If two countries, A and B, have the same level of GEA, and the same agriculture contribution to GDP, but country A&amp;#x2019;s economy is 10 times that of country B, setting the same target levels for GEA fails to take economic size into account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An indicator that measures the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure fails to take into account the relative contributions of the agricultural sector to a country&amp;#x2019;s GDP. Consider two countries with the same economic size, C and D, where agriculture contributes 2 per cent to C&amp;#x2019;s GDP, and 10 per cent to country D&amp;#x2019;s GDP. If total Government Expenditures were equal in both countries, C would experience greater relative investment in Agriculture than D. If total Government Expenditures differed, the result could be magnified or diluted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AOI index takes into account a country&amp;#x2019;s economic size, Agriculture&amp;#x2019;s contribution to GDP, and the total amount of Government Expenditure. As such, it allows for the setting of a universal and achievable target. Nonetheless, it is useful to interpret the AOI in combination with its numerator and denominator separately: the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure and the Agriculture value-added Share of GDP&lt;/p&gt;</data>
