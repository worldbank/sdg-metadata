Functions are classified using a three level scheme, consistent with the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC), Rev.4. In particular, the scheme includes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10 first-level, or two digit, categories, referred to as divisions, including Economic Affairs (04) and Environmental Protection (05); &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2) within each division, 2 or more 3-digit three-digit categories, referred to as groups, such as Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting (042) and Protection of Biodiversity and Landscapes (054); and &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3) within each group, one or more four-digit categories, referred to as classes, such as Agriculture (0421), Forestry (0422) and Fishing and hunting (0423). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Monetary Fund (IMF) questionnaire on Governmen Finance Statistics (GFS) collects data on the first two levels. The FAO questionnaire aims at collecting information on classes, as well as a breakdown of the related expenditure in recurrent and capital expenditures. The three classification levels and the contents of each class are described in the GFSM 2014, accessible at https://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/gfsm/. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAOSTAT geographic classification is used to aggregate indicators across country groups (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#definitions&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#definitions&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
