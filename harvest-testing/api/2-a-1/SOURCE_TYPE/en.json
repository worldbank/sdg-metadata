Since countries typically compile government expenditure data based on their financial systems, and is administrative data covering the entirely of government expenditures, particularly at the central government level, there is no sampling issue and no possibility of sampling error. For some countries that do not report such data to FAO, data may be obtained from the IMF GFS database (which includes similar data but covering more sectors, and with less disaggregation of COFOG 042) or from official national governmental websites. </p>\n<p>Data on agriculture value-added and GDP are based on the system of national accounts, which is an analytical framework that compiles national data from a mix of survey, census and administrative (e.g. tax) sources. This data is obtained from the UN Statistics Division, which provides national accounts estimates for 220 countries and territories.</p>"}
