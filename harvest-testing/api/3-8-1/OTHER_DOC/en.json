Unmet need for family planning is the proportion of women of reproductive age (15&#x2013;49 years) either married or in a consensual union, who are fecund and sexually active but who are not using any method of contraception (modern or traditional), and report not wanting any more children or wanting to delay the birth of their next child for at least two years.

The WHO framework largely draws on the latest revisions to the internationally standardized classification systems of the International Labour Organization (International Standard Classification of Occupations), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (International Standard Classification of Education), and the United Nations Statistics Division (International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities). </p>\n        <p>Methodological details and data can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.who.int/hrh/statistics/hwfstats/en/\">http://www.who.int/hrh/statistics/hwfstats/en/</a></p>\n        <p>Data are from the following sources:</p>\n        <p>Physicians: <a href=\"http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.HWFGRP_0020?lang=en\">http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.HWFGRP_0020?lang=en</a></p>\n        <p>Psychiatrists: <a href=\"https://www.who.int/healthinfo/universal_health_coverage/report/2017/en/\">https://www.who.int/healthinfo/universal_health_coverage/report/2017/en/</a></p>\n        <p>Surgeons: <a href=\"http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.HWF9?lang=en%20\">http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.HWF9?lang=en</a> </p>\n        <p>(data here were supplemented by prior editions of the the database)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Method of estimation</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Using available data, the indicator is computed by first rescaling, separately, health worker density ratios for each of the three cadres (physicians, psychiatrists and surgeons) relative to the minimum observed values across OECD countries since 2000, which are as follows: physicians = 0.9 per 1000, psychiatrists = 1 per 100,000, and surgeons = 14 per 100,000. This rescaling is done in the same way as that for the hospital bed density indicator described above, resulting in indicator values that range from 0 to 100 for each of the three cadres. For example, using country data on physicians per 1000 population (<em>x</em>), the cadre-specific indicator would be computed as:</p>\n        <p>Country with <em>x</em> &lt; 0.9 per 1000 per year, the cadre-specific indicator = <em>x</em> /0.9*100. </p>\n        <p>Country with <em>x</em> &gt;= 0.9 per 1000 per year, the cadre-specific indicator = 100.</p>\n        <p>As a final step, the geometric mean of the three cadre-specific indicator values is computed to obtain the final indicator of health workforce density.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>UHC-related notes</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>The &#x201C;physicians&#x201D; category would ideally be expanded to include all &#x201C;core health professionals&#x201D;, such as nurses and midwives. However, no internationally comparable data base exists that uses consistent definitions of non-physician core health professionals to allow for fully accurate cross-country comparisons. </p>\n        <p>For countries without observed data, the density of surgeons was estimated from a regression that predicts the log of surgeons per 100,000, obtained from the WHO data base described above, as a function of the log of GDP per capita, as estimated by the World Bank.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Tracer area</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Health security</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Indicator definition</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>International Health Regulations (IHR) core capacity index, which is the average percentage of attributes of 13 core capacities that have been attained at a specific point in time. </p>\n        <p>The 13 core capacities are: (1) National legislation, policy and financing; (2) Coordination and National Focal Point communications; (3) Surveillance; (4) Response; (5) Preparedness; (6) Risk communication; (7) Human resources; (8) Laboratory; (9) Points of entry; (10) Zoonotic events; (11) Food safety; (12) Chemical events; (13) Radionuclear emergencies.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Numerator</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Number of attributes attained</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Denominator</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Total number of attributes</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Main data sources</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Key informant survey</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Method of measurement</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Key informants report on attainment of a set of attributes for each of 13 core capacities using a standard WHO instrument, as described here: <a href=\"http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/84933/1/WHO_HSE_GCR_2013.2_eng.pdf\">http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/84933/1/WHO_HSE_GCR_2013.2_eng.pdf</a></p>\n        <p>Capacity-level indicator values can be found here: </p>\n        <p><a href=\"http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.IHRSPARALL?lang=en\">http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.IHRSPARALL?lang=en</a></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Method of estimation</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>The indicator is computed by averaging, across the 13 core capacities, the percentage of attributes for each capacity that have been attained.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>UHC-related notes</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Countries began reporting IHR core capacity attainment to WHO for the year 2010.
