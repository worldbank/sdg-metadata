{"status":"success","message":"The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 3-5-2, translated into en","data":"<h2>Collection process:</h2>\n<p>The Global Survey on Alcohol and Health is conducted periodically (latest one in 2016) in collaboration with all six WHO regional offices. National counterparts or focal points in all WHO Member States are officially nominated by the respective ministries of health. They are provided with the online survey data collection tool for completion. Where this is not feasible, a hard copy of the tool is forwarded directly to those who requested it. The survey submissions are checked and whenever information is incomplete or in need of clarification, the questionnaire is returned to the focal point or national counterpart in the country concerned for revision. Amendments to the survey responses are resubmitted by e-mail or electronically. Data submitted from countries is triangulated with data from key industry-supported data providers at annual meetings organized by WHO with an objective to identify discrepancies and solutions. Estimates for key indicators are compiled into country profiles which are sent to the focal point or national counterpart in the country for validation and endorsement.</p>"}
