{"status":"success","message":"The RATIONALE field for indicator 3-5-2, translated into en","data":"<p>Alcohol consumption can have an impact not only on the incidence of diseases, injuries and other health conditions, but also on the course of disorders and their outcomes in individuals. Alcohol consumption has been identified as a component cause for more than 200 diseases, injuries and other health conditions. Per capita alcohol consumption is widely accepted as the best possible indicator of alcohol exposure in populations and the key indicator for estimation of alcohol-attributable disease burden and alcohol-attributable deaths. Its correct interpretation requires the use of additional population-based indicators such as prevalence of drinking, and, as a result, stimulates development of national monitoring systems on alcohol and health involving contributions from a wide range of stakeholders, including alcohol production and trade sectors. </p>"}
