	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on women&amp;#x2019;s and men&amp;#x2019;s representation in elected positions of legislative/ deliberative bodies of local government are currently estimated as available for 89 of countries in the world. This estimate is based on a count of countries covered by regional databases in Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and ad-hoc studies in Asia and Pacific. However, the indicator used vary from one region to another. The count of countries is expected to change after the methodology of the indicator is used consistently across countries and regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disaggregation: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on elected positions in legislative/deliberative bodies of local government have to be disaggregated by sex to enable the calculation of the indicator. No additional disaggregation is required for SDG reporting. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
