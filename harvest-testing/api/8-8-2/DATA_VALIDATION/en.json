{"status":"success","message":"The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 8-8-2, translated into en","data":"<p>The indicator is based on three key premises: (i) definitional validity &#x2013; the extent to which the evaluation criteria and their corresponding definitions accurately reflect the phenomena they are meant to measure; (ii) transparency &#x2013; how readily a coded violation can be traced back to any given textual source; and (iii) inter-coder reliability &#x2013; the extent to which different evaluators working independently are able to consistently arrive at the same results.</p>\n<p><em>Definitional validity</em>. As these are meant to be indicators of <em>international</em> FACB rights, the evaluation criteria and their corresponding definitions are directly based on the ILO Constitution, ILO Conventions No. 87 and 98 and the related body of comments of the ILO supervisory bodies.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-6\" id=\"footnote-ref-6\">[5]</a></sup> Given that the ILO supervisory system is also guided by these definitions, this facilitates the coding itself given the heavy reliance on ILO textual sources produced by the supervisory system. </p>\n<p><em>Transparency</em>. A key rationale for the large number of evaluation criteria is to eliminate catchall evaluation criteria for violations of FACB rights not elsewhere coded, that is, violations for which there are no explicit evaluation criteria. This level of detail also facilitates the transparency of the method, in that very specific violations can be readily traced back to individual textual sources. This is made possible by the coding itself, in which violations are coded with the letters &#x201C;a&#x201D; through &#x201C;g,&#x201D; with each letter standing for one of the seven textual sources coded, as discussed below. </p>\n<p><em>Inter-coder reliability</em>. The method is based on clear and comprehensive coding rules as well as definitions for each of the evaluation criteria with the aim of making the indicators reproducible. Inter-coder reliability was assessed in the process of training teams of lawyers (sequentially and independently of each other) to do the coding and in double-checking their coding, which resulted in a number of clarifications and refinements to the coding rules and definitions. This process led to the conclusion that the inter-coder reliability of the method depends first and foremost on the coders being sufficiently well-trained and in particular being sufficiently well-versed in the coding rules and definitions to be able to apply them consistently. </p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-6\">5</sup><p> The related body of comments of the ILO supervisory bodies are: <em>Digest of Decisions and Principles of the Freedom of Association Committee of the Governing Body of the ILO</em> (ILO, 2006); <em>Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining: General Survey of the Reports on the Freedom of Association and the Right to Organise Convention (No. 87), 1948, and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention (No. 98)</em> (ILO, 1994); <em>General Survey on the Fundamental Conventions Concerning Rights at Work in Light of the ILO Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization, 2008</em> (ILO, 2012). <a href=\"#footnote-ref-6\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>"}
