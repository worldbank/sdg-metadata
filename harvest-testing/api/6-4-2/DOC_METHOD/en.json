{"status":"success","message":"The DOC_METHOD field for indicator 6-4-2, translated into en","data":"<h2>Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level:</h2>\n<p>This indicator provides an estimate of pressure by all sectors on the country&#x2019;s renewable freshwater resources. A low level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors is marginal in relation to the resources, and has therefore little potential impact on the sustainability of the resources or on the potential competition between users. A high level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors represents a substantial share of the total renewable freshwater resources, with potentially larger impacts on the sustainability of the resources and potential situations of conflicts and competition between users.</p>\n<p>The indicator is computed based on three components:</p>\n<p><strong>Total renewable freshwater resources (TRWR)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Total freshwater withdrawal (TFWW)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Environmental flow requirements (EFR)</strong> </p>\n<p><em>Water Stress (%) = TFWW/(TRWR &#x2013; EFR) *100</em></p>\n<p>Several documents exist that can be used to support countries in the computation of this indicator.

The process of collecting and checking the data has resulted in the establishment of a unique network of collaborators who provide data, use data from other countries for comparative purposes, and exchange views and experiences on how best to measure and account for water-related use. Users range from international private companies to non-governmental organizations, and virtually all significant reports related to water depend on the data provided by AQUASTAT.<br><a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc817e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc817e.pdf</a></p>\n<p><strong>Incorporating environmental flows into &#x201C;water stress&#x201D; indicator 6.4.2 - Guidelines for a minimum standard method for global reporting.</strong></p>\n<p>These guidelines are intended to assist countries to participate in the assessment of SDG 6.4.2 on water stress by contributing data and information on environmental flows (EF).
