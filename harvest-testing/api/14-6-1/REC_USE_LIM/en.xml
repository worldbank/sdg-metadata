	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 14-6-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Comments and limitations:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the status of a country as party or non-party to an international agreement which is available as public record, the indicator is a self-analysis by the country of their state of implementation of the various international instruments. Although questions in the questionnaire will be accompanied by pop up guides describing any technical aspects or terms, there may be a small variance in interpretation by different respondents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, due to the fact that responses are not provided by an independent source, responses could in theory be politically influenced.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
