{"status":"success","message":"The RATIONALE field for indicator 14-6-1, translated into en","data":"<p>The purpose of this indicator is to show a picture of the state of implementation of the instruments to combat IUU fishing, at a national, regional and global level. The first edition of the indicator will provide a baseline of the current state of implementation of these agreements. Subsequent indicator estimates will then be able to show any progress made by countries. </p>\n<p>Although the exact score will be important from one reporting year to the next for determining the progress made by a country, to aid the interpretation of this indicator, the score will then be converted into one of five bands as following:</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Score</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Bands</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>&gt;0 &#x2013;&lt; 0.2</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Band 1: Very low implementation of applicable instruments to combat IUU fishing</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>0.2 &#x2013;&lt; 0.4</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Band 2: Low implementation of applicable instruments to combat IUU fishing</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>0.4 &#x2013;&lt; 0.6</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Band 3: Medium implementation of applicable instruments to combat IUU fishing</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>0.6 &#x2013;&lt; 0.8</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Band 4: High implementation of applicable instruments to combat IUU fishing</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>0.8 &#x2013; 1.0</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Band 5: Very high implementation of applicable instruments to combat IUU fishing</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Additionally, a State may receive an indicator score of &#x201C;N/A&#x201D;, in the case that none of the instruments are applicable.
