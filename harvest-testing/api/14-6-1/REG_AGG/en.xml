	<message>The REG_AGG field for indicator 14-6-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Regional and global aggregates for this indicator will count the number of countries within a region or globally that fall under each of the five bands, as a proportion of the countries within a region or globally that have reported this indicator. This approach better illustrates the distribution of scores in each region and avoids determining a mean score for a region that assumes that non-reporting countries are equal to the mean, which would not be appropriate for a means-of-implementation type indicator like this.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
