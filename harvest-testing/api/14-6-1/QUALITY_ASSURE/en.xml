	<message>The QUALITY_ASSURE field for indicator 14-6-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Quality assurance:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questionnaire was created upon the request of the Members to the Committee on Fisheries. Within this process, FAO would not be in a position to question the responses of countries. Equally, this would require independent analysis of the status of implementation in the field of all responding countries for every edition of the questionnaire, a task that would require a substantial outlay of resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAO is however carrying out national and regional workshops on the implementation of international instruments to combat IUU fishing. During these workshops, the indicator is used a tool to understand the situation within the countries, all the while ensuring that there is a clear understanding of the questions or any other technical aspects relevant to this indicator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, once the user has completed the questionnaire, the user is able to extract a report of the indicator detailing their responses to the relevant questions and the corresponding scoring. The questionnaire respondent will then be able to validate the indicator score, which will in turn be automatically stored onto FAO databases. This system has been put in place, not only to ensure that no mistakes were made during the completion of the questionnaire but also to ensure transparency of the indicator process.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
