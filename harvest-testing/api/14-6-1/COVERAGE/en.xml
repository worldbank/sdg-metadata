	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data required for this indicator is not currently available. It will become available in early 2018 after the closure of the 2017/18 edition of the Questionnaire for monitoring the implementation of the 1995 FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. Thereafter it will be collected regularly every two years through the Questionnaire for monitoring the implementation of the 1995 FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time series:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2017 (When available will become baseline)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to nature of indicator, there will only be one score per country which could then be aggregated regionally or globally.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
