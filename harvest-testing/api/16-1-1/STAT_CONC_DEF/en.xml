	<message>The STAT_CONC_DEF field for indicator 16-1-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Concepts and definitions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is defined as the total count of victims of intentional homicide divided by the total population, expressed per 100,000 population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intentional homicide is defined as the unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent to cause death or serious injury (Source: International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes, ICCS 2015); population refers to total resident population in a given country in a given year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ICCS intentional homicide is defined as the &amp;#x2018;&amp;#x2018;Unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent to cause death or serious injury&amp;#x201D;. This definition contains three elements characterizing the killing of a person as intentional homicide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The killing of a person by another person (objective element);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The intent of the perpetrator to kill or seriously injure the victim (subjective element);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The unlawfulness of the killing, which means that the law considers the perpetrator liable for the unlawful death (legal element).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This definition states that, for statistical purposes, all killings corresponding to the three criteria above should be considered as intentional homicides, irrespective of definitions provided by national legislations or practices.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
