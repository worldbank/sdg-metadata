	<data>&lt;p&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differences in the questionnaires used in the household surveys as the basic measurement tool may entail differences in specific definitions of employment and unemployment, differences in the treatment of specific groups or differences in the operational criteria used to determine the individual&amp;#x2019;s labour force status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unemployment rate is dependent on the geographical coverage of the survey since urban and rural areas tend to have significant differences in the incidence of unemployment. It is important to note that unemployment indicators do not convey any information on the characteristics of the unemployed (their education level, ethnic origin, socio-economic background, work experience, duration of unemployment, etc.), which is crucial to cast light on labour market failures.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
