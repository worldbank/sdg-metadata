	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 8-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data availability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data disaggregated by sex and age for this indicator is available for 186 countries and territories. The indicator is widely available based on real observations provided by countries and derived from national labour force surveys, other types of household surveys or population census. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the disaggregation by disability is not widely available and this submission only includes 68 countries and territories. It is increasingly reported but coverage is still very low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time series:&lt;br&gt;Data for disaggregation by sex and age for this indicator is available as of 2000 until 2019 for countries in the SDG Indicators Global Database, but time series going back further are available in ILOSTAT. 2020 regional aggregates are available for total population. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data for disaggregation by disability status is available for the period from 2005 to 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator should, ideally, be disaggregated by sex, age group and disability status. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
