	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Collection process:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ILO Department of Statistics sends out its annual questionnaire on labour statistics to all relevant agencies within each country (national statistical office, labour ministry, etc.) requesting for the latest annual data available and any revisions on numerous labour market topics and indicators, including many SDG indicators. Indicator 8.5.2 is calculated from statistics submitted to the ILO via this questionnaire as well as through special agreements with regional and national statistical offices or through the processing of microdata sets of national labour force surveys.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
