	<data>&lt;p&gt;Two main sources exist at country level: a) administrative asylum systems; b) direct refugee registration databases. In cases where UNHCR performs refugee registration directly, operations provide data which is available with a highest degree of disaggregation. In cases where refugees go through a Refugee Status Determination (RSD) administrative procedure, data is collected by Governments in the biannual Population Statistics Review exercise facilitated by focal points in UNHCR country offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Population data are derived from annual estimates produced by the UN Population Division (World Population Prospects, Standard Projections, Total Population, both sexes &amp;#x2013; Medium Variant).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
