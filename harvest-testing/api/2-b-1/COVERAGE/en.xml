	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 2-b-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cf. latest revision of WTO document series G/AG/GEN/86 (table under section 2.4 &amp;#x2013; Members with shaded cells) for a detailed description of data availability for export subsidies notified by Members with export subsidy reduction commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, 10 developing country Members notified since 1995 the use of export subsidies, pursuant to the provisions of article 9.4 of the Agreement on Agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the information for developed country Members with export subsidy reduction commitments that is available for all notified years, information for developing country Members using export subsidies, pursuant to the provisions of article 9.4 of the Agreement on Agriculture is available only for the years during which these export subsidies were used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time series:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 1995 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator gives country and product based information on the level of applied export subsidies, both in terms of budgetary outlays and quantities.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
