They represent the ratio of the indicator value for one group to that of the other. Typically, the likely more disadvantaged group is placed in the numerator. A value of exactly 1 indicates parity between the two groups.</p>\n<h2><strong><strong>Concepts:</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>See metadata for relevant underlying indicator.</p><h1>Data sources</h1>\n<h2><strong><strong>Description:</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>The sources are the same as for the underlying indicators for this goal.</p><h2><strong><strong>Collection process:</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>The same as the underlying indicator.</p><h1>Calendar</h1>\n<h2><strong><strong>Data collection:</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>Depends on underlying indicator. </p><h2><strong><strong>Data release:</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>Depends on underlying indicator. </p><h1>Data providers</h1>\n<p>The same as the underlying indicator.</p><h1>Data compilers</h1>\n<p>UNESCO Institute for Statistics</p><h2><strong><strong>Rationale:</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>To measure the general level of disparity between two sub-populations of interest with regard to a given indicator.
