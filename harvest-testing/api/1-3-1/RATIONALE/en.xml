	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 1-3-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Rationale and interpretation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access to at least a basic level of social protection throughout the life cycle is a human right. The principle of universality of social protection evidences the importance of social protection systems in guaranteeing decent living conditions to the whole population, throughout their lives. The proportion of the population covered by social protection systems/floors provides an indication of the extent to which universality is accomplished, and thus, how secure are the population&amp;apos;s living conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measurements of &lt;strong&gt;effective coverage&lt;/strong&gt; should reflect how in reality legal provisions are implemented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It refers to the percentage of people actually receiving benefits of contributory and non-contributory social protection programmes, plus the number of persons actively contributing to social insurance schemes.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
