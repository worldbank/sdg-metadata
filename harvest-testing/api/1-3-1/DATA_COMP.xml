			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Calculations include separate indicators in order to distinguish effective coverage for children, unemployed persons, older persons and persons with disabilities, mothers with newborns, workers protected in case of work injury, and the poor and the vulnerable. For each case, coverage expressed as a share of the respective population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicators are obtained as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proportion of population covered by at least one social protection cash benefit: ratio of the population receiving cash benefits under at least one of the contingencies/social protection function (contributory or non-contributory benefit) or actively contributing to at least one social security scheme to the total population.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proportion of children covered by social protection benefits: ratio of children/households receiving child or family cash benefits to the total number of children/households with children.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proportion of women giving birth covered by maternity benefits: ratio of women receiving cash maternity benefits to women giving birth in the same year (estimated based on age-specific fertility rates published in the UN&amp;#x2019;s World Population Prospects or on the number of live births corrected for the share of twin and triplet births).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proportion of persons with disabilities receiving benefits: ratio of persons receiving disability cash benefits to persons with severe disabilities. The latter is calculated as the product of prevalence of disability ratios (published for each country group by the World Health Organization) and each country&amp;#x2019;s population.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proportion of unemployed receiving benefits: ratio of recipients of unemployment cash benefits to the number of unemployed persons.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proportion of workers covered in case of employment injury: ratio of workers protected by injury insurance to total employment or the labour force. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proportion of older persons receiving a pension: ratio of persons above statutory retirement age receiving an old-age pension to persons above statutory retirement age (including contributory and non-contributory).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proportion of vulnerable persons receiving benefits: ratio of social assistance recipients to the total number of vulnerable persons. The latter are calculated by subtracting from total population all people of working age who are contributing to a social insurance scheme or receiving contributory benefits, and all persons above retirement age receiving contributory benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proportion of poor population receiving social assistance cash benefit: ratio of social assistance recipients to the population living below the national poverty line.&lt;/li&gt;
