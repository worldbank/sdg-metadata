&lt;p&gt;UNICEF maintains the global database on birth registration that is used for SDG and other official reporting. Before the inclusion of any data point in the database, it is reviewed by technical focal points at UNICEF headquarters to check for consistency and overall data quality. This review is based on a set of objective criteria to ensure that only the most recent and reliable information are included in the databases. These criteria include the following: data sources must include proper documentation; data values must be representative at the national population level; data are collected using an appropriate methodology (e.g., sampling); data values are based on a sufficiently large sample; data conform to the standard indicator definition including age group and concepts, to the extent possible; data are plausible based on trends and consistency with previously published/reported estimates for the indicator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 2018, UNICEF launched a new country consultation process with national authorities on selected SDG indicators, which place strong emphasis on technical rigour, country ownership and use of official data and statistics. The consultation process solicited feedback directly from National Statistical Offices, as well as other government agencies responsible for official statistics, on the compilation of the indicators, including the data sources used, and the application of internationally agreed definitions, classification and methodologies to the data from that source. Once reviewed, feedback is made available to countries on whether or not specific data points are accepted, and if not, the reasons why. More details on the consultation process can be found in the child-related global SDG indicators it is custodian or co-custodian to meet emerging standards and guidelines on data flows for global reporting of &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.unicef.org/resources/resource-type/guidance/&quot;&gt;guidance note.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</data>
