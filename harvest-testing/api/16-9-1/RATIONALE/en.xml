	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Rationale:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registering children at birth is the first step in securing their recognition before the law, safeguarding their rights, and ensuring that any violation of these rights does not go unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children without official identification documents may be denied health care or education. Later in life, the lack of such documentation can mean that a child may enter into marriage or the labour market, or be conscripted into the armed forces, before the legal age. In adulthood, birth certificates may be required to obtain social assistance or a job in the formal sector, to buy or prove the right to inherit property, to vote and to obtain a passport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children&amp;#x2019;s right to a name and nationality is enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) under Article 7.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
