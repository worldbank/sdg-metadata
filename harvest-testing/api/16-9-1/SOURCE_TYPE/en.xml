	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Censuses, household surveys such as MICS and DHS and national civil registration systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civil registration systems&lt;/strong&gt;: Civil registration systems that are functioning effectively compile vital statistics that are used to compare the estimated total number of births in a country with the absolute number of registered births during a given period. These data normally refer to live births that were registered within a year or the legal time frame for registration applicable in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Household or other population-based surveys&lt;/strong&gt;: In the absence of reliable administrative data, household surveys have become a key source of data to monitor levels and trends in birth registration. The standard indicator used in DHS and MICS to report on birth registration refers to the percentage of children under age 5 (0-59 months) with a birth certificate, regardless of whether or not it was seen by the interviewer, or whose birth was reported as registered with civil authorities at the time of survey. Depending on the country, surveys collecting these data may be conducted every 3-5 years, or possibly at more frequent intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Censuses &lt;/strong&gt;can also provide data on children who have acquired their right to a legal identity. However, censuses are conducted only every ten years (in most countries) and are therefore not well-suited for routine monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
