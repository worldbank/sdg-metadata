	<data>&lt;p&gt;An international survey is sent to national human rights institution, which fill it in and send it back to the international mechanism. The latter also use complementary information, if available, received from civil society organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National human rights institutions seeking accreditation have to submit detailed information about their practices and how they directly promote compliance with the Paris Principles, namely the Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions that were adopted by the General Assembly (resolution 48/134). Information to be submitted relates to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Guarantee of tenure for members of the National Human Rights Institution decision-making body; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) full-time members of a National Human Rights Institution; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Guarantee of functional immunity; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Recruitment and retention of National Human Rights Institution staff; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) Staffing of the National Human Rights Institution by secondment; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6) National Human Rights Institutions during the situation of a coup d&amp;#x2019;&amp;#xE9;tat or a state of emergency; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7) Limitation of power of National Human Rights Institutions due to national security; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8) Administrative regulation of National Human Rights Institutions; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9) Assessing National Human Rights Institutions as National Preventive and National Monitoring Mechanisms; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10) The quasi-judicial competency of National Human Rights Institutions (complaints-handling). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the information received, the process of accreditation is conducted through peer review by the Sub-Committee on Accreditation (SCA) of GANHRI. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
