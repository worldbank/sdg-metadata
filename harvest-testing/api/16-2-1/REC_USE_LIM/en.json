{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 16-2-1, translated into en","data":"<p>In the third and fourth rounds of MICS, the standard indicator referred to the percentage of children</p>\n<p>aged 2-14 years who experienced any form of violent discipline (physical punishment and/or psychological aggression) within the past month. Beginning with the fifth round of MICS (MICS5), the age group covered was expanded to capture children&#x2019;s experiences with disciplinary practices between the ages of 1 and 14 years. Therefore, current data availability does not capture the full age range specified in the SDG indicator since data are not collected for adolescents aged 15-17 years and further methodological work is needed to identify additional items on disciplinary practices relevant for older adolescents.</p>"}
