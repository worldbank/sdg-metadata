			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;There is a dedicated SDG 6.5.1 Help Desk for ensuring the quality of the statistical results. Firstly, the data goes through any national quality assurance and approval processes, before being submitted to the Help Desk. The Help Desk then undertakes the Quality Assurance procedure described in section 4.j. All issues are discussed between the Help Desk and the Focal Point(s). Only when all issues are resolved, are the data finalised and entered into the Help Desk Database. The data is then submitted to the UNEP SDG focal point, who collates all indicator data for which UNEP is the Custodian Agency, where a further quality check is undertaken, prior to submission to the SDGs Indicator Database. &lt;/p&gt;
