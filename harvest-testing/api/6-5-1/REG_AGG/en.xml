	<data>&lt;p&gt;Following the Agenda 2030 principle of &amp;#x201C;leaving no one behind&amp;#x201D;, regional and global values are based on simple, un-weighted averages of country scores. The country scores are presented as a whole number, and regional and global averages are also presented as a whole number. Global averages are based on country values, not regional averages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional values may be assembled by regional bodies responsible for water resources in the region, such as the African Ministerial Council on Water (AMCOW), the European Environment Agency (EEA), and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for West Asia (ESCWA).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
