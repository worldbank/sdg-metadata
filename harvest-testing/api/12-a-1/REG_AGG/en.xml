	<message>The REG_AGG field for indicator 12-a-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Regional aggregates:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional and global totals are calculated by summing the renewable generating capacity for a region or the World and dividing that by the corresponding figure for total population. The indicator is for developing countries only, so these regional aggregates (averages) also reflect only the average for the developing countries in each region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This calculation excludes the population of those countries and/or territories that have missing capacity data. As such, the regional and global population values used in the calculation might differ from those reported in the UN World Population Prospects. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
