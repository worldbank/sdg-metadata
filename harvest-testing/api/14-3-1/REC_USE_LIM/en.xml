	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 14-3-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The methodology for this indicator has been developed with the technical support of experts in the field of ocean acidification. It provides globally accepted and adapted guidelines and best practices established by scientists and published in peer-reviewed literature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this is a highly complex indicator, the technical infrastructure necessary for the correct measurement is a potentially constraining factor. The Methodology for the indicator describes how to avoid comparability issues of the data, which have been problematic in the past, as well as measurement errors and advises on the most appropriate technical and methodological procedures to guarantee high-quality data that can be used for the global assessment of ocean acidification. The addition of metadata to the methodology for this indicator is crucial for adding traceability and transparency to the data, by providing information on the precise equipment and methodology used, as well as specifying the location, accompanying biogeochemical variables and the person taking the measurement.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
