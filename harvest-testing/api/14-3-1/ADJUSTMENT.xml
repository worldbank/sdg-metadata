			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The 14.3.1 data and metadata files give detailed information about the requested data and metadata to report. Data and metadata files contain compulsory variables to be reported and additional variables to be included if available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data providers/Member States are encouraged to submit primary quality controlled data sets of two variables characterizing the carbonate system: pH, TA, DIC or &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, plus precise location, temperature, salinity and hydrostatic pressure (sampling depth) (see Quality control). Depending on data quality, different categories will be assigned to the submitted data sets. In addition, corresponding macro nutrient concentrations are requested, if nitrate, phosphate and silicate data are available (see Data quality). Further, data providers will be invited to submit all data, independent of where the data were collected within the water column; however, they are encouraged to provide surface data (&amp;#x2264; 10 m). &lt;/p&gt;
