			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;SDG indicator 16.7.2 complements indicator &lt;strong&gt;16.7.1&lt;/strong&gt; (under the same target 16.7 -- &amp;#x201C;Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels&amp;#x201D;) which draws on administrative data sources to measure the proportional representation of various population groups in public institutions. The two indicators are highly complementary as proportional representation alone is no guarantee that all population groups represented in public institutions have equal decision-making power, or that all population groups in the national population have equal opportunities to voice their interests and preferences and to influence public decision-making. Indicator 16.7.2 provides important additional information by focusing on the inclusiveness and responsiveness of decision-making, as perceived by the population (drawing from population surveys).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicator 16.7.2 can also be used to complement SDG target 10.2 on the promotion of the &amp;#x201C;social, economic and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status&amp;#x201D;, which only has one indicator measuring economic exclusion (&lt;strong&gt;SDG 10.2.1&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#x2013; Proportion of people living below 50 per cent of median income, by age, sex and persons with disabilities). Indicator 16.7.2 therefore provides important additional information to measure progress against this target by providing data on &lt;em&gt;political&lt;/em&gt; inclusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, 16.7.2 can also be used to complement SDG target 10.3 on &amp;#x201C;Ensuring equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome, including by eliminating discriminatory laws, policies and practices and promoting appropriate legislation, policies and action in this regard&amp;#x201D;, which only has one indicator measuring felt discrimination on various grounds (&lt;strong&gt;SDG 10.3.1&lt;/strong&gt; Proportion of the population reporting having personally felt discriminated against or harassed within the previous 12 months on the basis of a ground of discrimination prohibited under international human rights law). Indicator 16.7.2 therefore provides relevant additional information to measure progress against this target by helping to identify whether certain population groups might feel discriminated against in terms of their inclusion in public decision-making and the extent to which political institutions are responsive to their demands/preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
