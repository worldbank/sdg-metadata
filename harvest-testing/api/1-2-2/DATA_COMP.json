Initially, the dimensions and indicators should be chosen. In the standard approach of the AF methodology, the dimension consists of health, education and living standards. Health consists of two indicators; nutrition and child mortality. Education consists of two indicators; years of schooling and school attendance. Living standards contain six indicators which are cooking fuel, drinking water, sanitation, electricity, housing and assets. Therefore, in this case, there are three dimensions and ten indicators. </p>\n<p>After dimensions and indicators are chosen, a deprivation cut-off is set for each indicator. In the above example, it would yield a set of 10 binary variables for every person - the value of 1 if the individual is deprived in that indicator and 0 otherwise. Once the set of binary variables is calculated, each person is assigned a deprivation score denoted as c, indicating the proportion of deprivations weighted by the relative importance of each indicator. The deprivation score c is defined to take values ranging between 0 (indicating that the person does not experience any weighted deprivations) and 1 (indicating that they experience weighted deprivations in all the 10 indicators). Then to identify people who suffer multidimensional poverty in the country, the deprivation score c is compared to a poverty cut-off point. All people suffering deprivations in a number of weighted deprivations equal to or greater than this cut-off are identified as multidimensionally poor. Further details on AF methodology can be found <a href=\"https://ophi.org.uk/research/multidimensional-poverty/\">here</a>. It should be noted that although the country adopts AF methodology to measure multidimensional poverty, the sets of dimensions and indicators could be different country by country, as they would be tailored to specific contexts of each country. For the detailed methodology used to calculate the country-specific multidimensional poverty indicators, please refer to the official documentation through the links listed at the end.</p>\n<p>Secondly, we describe the AROPE methodology. As mentioned above, the AROPE consists of three indicators, which are &quot;at risk of poverty&quot; or &quot;severely materially deprived&quot; or &quot;living in a household with a very low work intensity&quot;. The &quot;at risk of poverty rate&quot; is the share of people with an equivalised disposable income below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold, which is set at 60% of the national median equivalised disposable income after social transfers. The equivalised disposable income is the total income of a household, after tax and other deductions, that is available for spending or saving, divided by the number of household members converted into equalised adults; household members are equalised or made equivalent by weighting each according to their age, using the so-called modified OECD equivalence scale. For poverty indicators, the equivalised disposable income is calculated from the total disposable income of each household divided by the equivalised household size. The income reference period is a fixed 12-month period (such as the previous calendar or tax year) for all countries except the UK for which the income reference period is the current year and Ireland for which the survey is continuous and income is collected for the last twelve months. </p>\n<p>Material deprivation refers to a state of economic strain and durables, defined as the enforced inability (rather than the <em>choice</em> not to do so) to pay unexpected expenses, afford a one-week annual holiday away from home, a meal involving meat, chicken or fish every second day, the adequate heating of a dwelling, durable goods like a washing machine, colour television, telephone or car, being confronted with payment arrears (mortgage or rent, utility bills, hire purchase installments or other loan payments). The material deprivation rate is an indicator in <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:EU_statistics_on_income_and_living_conditions_(EU-SILC)\">EU-SILC</a> that expresses the inability to afford some items considered by most people to be desirable or even necessary to lead an adequate life. The indicator distinguishes between individuals who cannot afford a certain good or service, and those who do not have this good or service for another reason, e.g., because they do not want or do not need it. The indicator adopted by the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/spsi/social_protection_committee_en.htm\">Social protection committee</a> measures the percentage of the population that cannot afford at least three of the following nine items: 1) to pay their rent, mortgage or utility bills; 2) to keep their home adequately warm; 3) to face unexpected expenses; 4) to eat meat or proteins regularly; 5) to go on holiday; 6) a television set; 7) a washing machine; 8) a car; 9) a telephone. Severe material deprivation rate is defined as the enforced inability to pay for at least four of the above-mentioned items.</p>\n<p>The indicator &quot;persons living in households with very low work intensity&quot; is defined as the number of persons living in a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Household_-_social_statistics\">household</a> where the members of working age worked less than 20 % of their total potential during the previous 12 months. The work intensity of a household is the ratio of the total number of months that all working-age household members have worked during the income <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Reference_year\">reference year</a> and the total number of months the same household members theoretically could have worked in the same period. A working-age person is a person aged 18-59 years, with the exclusion of students in the age group between 18 and 24 years. Households composed only of children, of students aged less than 25 and/or people aged 60 or more are completely excluded from the indicator calculation.

Because of that, we need a different set of measures, which is the average number of deprivations, also known as intensity. Intensity is calculated by adding up the proportion of total deprivations each person suffers and dividing by the total number of poor persons. For example, if say person 1 suffers 4 out of 6 deprivations and person 2 suffers 6 out of 6, and then the intensity will be calculated as (4/6 + 6/6)/2=5/6.</p>\n<p><u>Official multidimensional poverty headcount (% of total households)</u></p>\n<p>The calculation methodology is the same as the AF methodology described above, except for that the unit of analysis is household instead of individuals.</p>\n<p><u>Multidimensional deprivation for children (% of population under 18)</u></p>\n<p>In order to measure multidimensional poverty based on the MODA methodology, dimensions of children&apos;s well-being that best reflect the situation of poverty in the country should be defined. Each dimension of well-being is measured by a set of indicators based on available data. The selection of indicators and dimensions should be guided by data availability and relevance to children&apos;s needs and rights in each country&apos;s context. Given the life cycle approach emphasizing that children have different needs throughout the different phases of their childhood development, the selection of dimensions as well as the findings and results are disaggregated by age groups. Then a deprivation threshold is set for each indicator so that a child can be classified as either deprived or non-deprived in each indicator. For the multidimensional deprivation analysis, the number of dimensions in which a child is deprived is counted and then the percentage of children suffering from zero, one, two, three, etc deprivations is presented to see the distribution of deprivation. A cut-off point, or &quot;deprivation threshold&quot; (k) is used to define whether the child is multidimensionally poor or not and based on that, the percentage of multidimensionally poor children is calculated. It is important to note that a country-specific analysis is carried out adjusting the choice of dataset, age groups, dimensions, indicators and thresholds to better reflect each country&apos;s context and so the results presented in one country are not comparable with the findings of other countries on multidimensional poverty.
