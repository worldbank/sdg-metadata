	<message>The REG_AGG field for indicator 1-2-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Since the data for indicator 1.2.2 are based on the national definitions of poverty &amp;#x2013; and the methodologies used to produce them are different, as described in the &amp;#x201C;comments and limitations&amp;#x201D; section, data are not comparable across countries. Thus regional and global aggregates are not produced.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
