	<data>&lt;p&gt;Country teams use UNAIDS-supported Spectrum software to develop estimates annually. The country teams are comprised primarily of epidemiologists, demographers, monitoring and evaluation specialists and technical partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNAIDS Reference Group on Estimates, Modelling and Projections provides technical guidance on the development of the HIV component of the Spectrum software (www.epidem.org). The Spectrum software is developed by Avenir Health (www.avenirhealth.org)&amp;#x2014;which includes a module, the Estimates and Projections Package, which is developed by the East-West Center (www.eastwestcenter.org). &lt;/p&gt;</data>
