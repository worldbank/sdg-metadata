	<data>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; At country level: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimates are not collected from countries with populations &amp;lt; 250,000. In addition no estimates are available for 10 countries with very small HIV epidemics who do not produce estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some countries the estimates were not finalized at the time of publication. The country specific values are not presented for these countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; At regional and global levels: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The countries with populations &amp;lt; 250,000 and the 10 countries that do not produce estimates are not included in regional or global level estimates. For countries in which the estimates were not finalized at the time of publication, the unofficial best estimates are included in the regional and global values. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
