	<data>&lt;p&gt;Longitudinal data on individuals newly infected with HIV would be the most accurate source of data but are rarely available for representative populations. Special diagnostic tests in surveys or from health facilities can also be used to obtain data on HIV incidence but these require very large samples to accurately estimate HIV incidence and the latter are also rarely representative. HIV incidence is thus modelled using the Spectrum software&lt;/p&gt;</data>
