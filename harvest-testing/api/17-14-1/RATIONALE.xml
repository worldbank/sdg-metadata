			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Enhancing policy coherence for sustainable development is important for achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions (economic, social and environmental) in a balanced and integrated manner; for ensuring coherence between policies at various levels of government; and for ensuring that policies in different sectors are mutually supportive and do not work against each other. It is also important in addressing the impacts of domestic policy internationally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy coherence aims, as a minimum, to identify trade-offs and mitigate negative impacts between policies. At a more ambitious level, it should also aim to foster synergies and produce policies that mutually reinforce each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a more ambitious level, it should also aim to foster synergies and produce policies that mutually reinforce each other, and to ensure that policies put in place are implementable and sustainable as they are inclusive of the concerned stakeholders&amp;#x2019; perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
