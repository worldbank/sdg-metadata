&lt;p&gt;The plant component of the indicator is calculated as the total number of unique accessions of plant genetic resources secured in medium to long term conservation facilities. This should include all the accessions in base collections, and unique accessions stored in medium term conservation facilities, as active collections, only when these accessions are considered to become part of the national base collections. Base collections may include both seed, field, cryo-preserved or &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; collections depending on the species conserved and the available facilities in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal genetic resources&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the animal component the indicator is calculated as the number of local breeds with enough genetic material stored within genebank collections allowing to reconstitute the breed in case of extinction (based on the Guidelines on Cryconservation of animal genetic resources, FAO, 2012, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
