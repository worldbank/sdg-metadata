	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time series:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data for this indicator is available as of 2000 in the SDG Indicators Global Database, but time series going back several decades are available in ILOSTAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator requires no disaggregation per se, although employment statistics by both sex and occupation are needed to calculate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If statistics are available and the sample size permits, it may be of interest to cross-tabulate this indicator by economic activity (ISIC) or disaggregate further to observe the share of women across more detailed occupational groups.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
