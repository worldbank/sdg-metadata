	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 5-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data availability: Data on proportion of women in managerial positions is available for 168 countries and territories. Data on women in senior and middle management positions is available for 116 countries and territories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time series:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data for this indicator is available as of 2000 in the SDG Indicators Global Database, but time series going back several decades are available in ILOSTAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator requires no disaggregation per se, although employment statistics by both sex and occupation are needed to calculate it. If statistics are available and the sample size permits, it may be of interest to cross-tabulate this indicator by economic activity (ISIC) or disaggregate further to observe the share of women across more detailed occupational groups.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
