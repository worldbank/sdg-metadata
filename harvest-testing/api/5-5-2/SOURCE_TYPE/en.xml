	<message>The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 5-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data sources&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommended source for this indicator is a labour force survey or, if not available, other similar types of household surveys, including a module on employment. In the absence of any labour-related household survey, establishment surveys or administrative records may be used to gather information on the female share of employment by the required ISCO groups. In cases where establishment surveys or administrative records are used, the coverage is likely to be limited to formal enterprises or enterprises of a certain size. Information on the enterprises covered should be provided with the figures. When comparing figures across years, any changes in the versions of ISCO that are used should be taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
