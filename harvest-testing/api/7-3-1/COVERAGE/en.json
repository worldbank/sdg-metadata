GDP data are available for most countries on an annual basis. </p>\n<h2>Time series: </h2>\n<p>1990-present </p>\n<h2>Disaggregation: </h2>\n<p>Disaggregation of energy intensity, e.g. by final consumption sectors or end-uses, could provide further insights into progress towards energy efficiency. At present it is only feasible to calculate such sector disaggregations for the following sectors &#x2013; industry, residential, transport, agriculture, households &#x2013; as reported in the <em>Tracking SDG7: The Energy Progress Report</em> (formerly <em>Sustainable Energy for All Global Tracking Framework</em>). It would be desirable, over time, to develop more refined sectoral level energy intensity indicators that make it possible to look at energy intensity by industry (e.g. cement, steel) or by type of vehicle (e.g. cars, trucks), for example. Doing so will not be possible without statistical collaboration with the relevant energy consuming sectors. </p>\n<p>Decomposition analysis of energy intensity trends seeks to filter out factors that affect energy demand, such as economy wide scale and structure shifts, from more narrowly defined energy intensity shifts. The methodology applies decomposition analysis to isolate a more refined measure of energy intensity, one that sifts out the temporal shift of relative sector weights. This analysis is also reported in the <em>Tracking SDG7: The Energy Progress Report</em>. </p>"}
