&lt;p&gt;Energy intensity is defined as the energy supplied to the economy per unit value of economic output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concepts: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total energy supply, as defined by the International Recommendations for Energy Statistics (IRES), is made up of production plus net imports minus international marine and aviation bunkers plus-stock changes. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the measure of economic output. For international comparison purposes, GDP is measured in constant terms at purchasing power parity.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
