	<data>&lt;p&gt;Energy intensity is an indication of how much energy is used to produce one unit of economic output. It is an inverse proxy of the efficiency with which an economy is able to use energy to produce economic output. A lower ratio indicates that less energy is used to produce one unit of output, so decreasing trends indicate progress.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
