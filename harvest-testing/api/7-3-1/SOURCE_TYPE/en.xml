&lt;p&gt;Total energy supply is typically calculated in the making of national energy balances. Energy balances are compiled based on data collected for around 150 economies from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and for all countries in the world from the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GDP data are taken mainly from the World Bank &amp;#x2013; World Development Indicator database.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
