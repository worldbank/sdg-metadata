	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 7-3-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;This indicator is based on the development of comprehensive energy statistics across supply and demand for all energy sources &amp;#x2013; statistics used to produce the energy balance. Internationally agreed methodologies for energy statistics are described in the &amp;#x201C;International Recommendations for Energy Statistics&amp;#x201D; (IRES), adopted by the UN Statistical Commission, available at: &lt;a href=&quot;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/methodology/ires/&quot;&gt;unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/methodology/ires/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the energy balance is developed, the indicator can be obtained by dividing total energy supply over GDP.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
