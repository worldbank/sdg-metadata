	<data>&lt;p&gt;Energy intensity is only an imperfect proxy for energy efficiency. It can be affected by a number of factors, such as climate, structure of the economy, nature of economic activities etc. that are not necessarily linked to pure efficiency. For better assessment of energy efficiency progress, more disaggregated data are needed, such as those at the sectoral and end-use level.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
