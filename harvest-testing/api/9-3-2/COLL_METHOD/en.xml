	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 9-3-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;One of the main sources of data for this indicator currently available is the Enterprise Survey conducted by the World Bank which covers the formal sector and contains data for small and medium enterprises only (with 5 or more employees). In some countries, additional surveys, including Informal Surveys of unregistered enterprises and/or Micro Surveys for registered firms with less than five employees, are conducted and available at country level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Enterprise Survey is based on a representative sample of enterprises run by the private sector. The surveys cover a broad range of business environment topics including access to finance, corruption, infrastructure, crime, competition, and performance measures. Since 2002, the World Bank has collected these data from face-to-face interviews with top managers and business owners in over 161,000 companies in 144 economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surveys have been conducted since 2002 by different units within the World Bank. Since 2005-06, most data collection efforts have been centralized within the Enterprise Analysis Unit. Data from 2006 onward is comparable across countries. The raw individual country datasets, aggregated datasets (across countries and years), panel datasets, and all relevant survey documentation are publicly available on the Enterprise Surveys web site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator uses a simple weighted percentage formula, where the weights are the sampling weights. The strata for Enterprise Surveys are firm size, business sector, and geographic region within a country. Enterprise Surveys provide indicators covering manufacturing and services activities. Proportion of &amp;#x201C;small-scale industries&amp;#x201D; with a loan or line of credit for manufacturing only can be extracted from the micro data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enterprises are classified as small, medium or large based on the number of employees as follows: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Size of enterprise&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Number of employees&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Small&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;5 to 19 &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Medium&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;20 to 99 &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Large&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;more than 99&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey also defines an enterprise with female ownership as an enterprise having at least one female owner, and female-managed is measured by whether the top manager is a woman.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
