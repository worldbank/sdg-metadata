	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Concepts and definitions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definition:&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-1&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small-scale industrial enterprises&lt;/strong&gt;, in the SDG framework also called &amp;#x201C;&lt;strong&gt;small-scale industries&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#x201D;, defined here for the purpose of statistical data collection and compilation refer to statistical units, generally enterprises, engaged in production of goods and services for market below a designated size class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator shows the number of &amp;#x201C;small-scale industries&amp;#x201D; with an active line of credit or a loan from a financial institution in the reference year in percentage to the total number of such enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International recommendations for industrial statistics 2008 (IRIS 2008) (United Nations, 2011) define an &lt;strong&gt;enterprise&lt;/strong&gt; as the smallest legal unit that constitutes an organizational unit producing goods or services. The enterprise is the basic statistical unit at which all information relating to its production activities and transactions, including financial and balance-sheet accounts, are maintained. It is also used for institutional sector classification in the 2008 System of National Accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;establishment&lt;/strong&gt; is defined as an enterprise or part of an enterprise that is situated in a single location and in which only a single productive activity is carried out or in which the principal productive activity accounts for most of the value added. An establishment can be defined ideally as an economic unit that engages, under single ownership or control, that is, under a single legal entity, in one, or predominantly one, kind of economic activity at a single physical location. Mines, factories and workshops are examples. This ideal concept of an establishment is applicable to many of the situations encountered in industrial inquiries, particularly in manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the definition of an establishment allows for the possibility that there may be one or more secondary activities carried out in it, their magnitude should be small compared with that of the principal activity. If a secondary activity within an establishment is as important, or nearly as important, as the principal activity, then the unit is more like a local unit. It should be subdivided so that the secondary activity is treated as taking place within an establishment separate from the establishment in which the principal activity takes place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of most &lt;strong&gt;small-sized businesses&lt;/strong&gt;, the enterprise and the establishment will be identical. Some enterprises are large and complex with different kinds of economic activities undertaken at different locations. Such enterprises should be broken down into one or more establishments, provided that smaller and more homogeneous production units can be identified for which production data may be meaningfully compiled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As introduced in IRIS 2008 (United Nations, 2011), an &lt;strong&gt;economic activity&lt;/strong&gt; is understood as referring to a process, that is to say, to the combination of actions carried out by a certain entity that uses labor, capital, goods and services to produce specific products (goods and services). In general, industrial statistics reflect the characteristics and economic activities of units engaged in a class of industrial activities that are defined in terms of the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities, Revision 4 (ISIC Rev.4) (United Nations, 2008) or International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities, Revision 3.1 (ISIC Rev. 3) (United Nations, 2002).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total numbers of persons employed&lt;/strong&gt; is defined as the total number of persons who work in or for the statistical unit, whether full-time or part-time, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working proprietors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Active business partners&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unpaid family workers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paid employees (for more details see United Nations, 2011).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of a statistical unit based on employment should be defined primarily in terms of the average number of persons employed in that unit during the reference period. If the average number of persons employed is not available, the total number of persons employed in a single period may be used as the size criterion. The size classification should consist of the following classes of the average number of persons employed: 1-9, 10-19, 20-49, 50-249, 250 and more. This should be considered a minimum division of the overall range; more detailed classifications, where required, should be developed within this framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;loan&lt;/strong&gt; is a financial instrument that is created when a creditor lends funds directly to a debtor and receives a nonnegotiable document as evidence of the asset. This category includes overdrafts, mortgage loans, loans to finance trade credit and advances, repurchase agreements, financial assets and liabilities created by financial leases, and claims on or liabilities to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the form of loans. Trade credit and advances and similar accounts payable/receivable are not loans. Loans that have become marketable in secondary markets should be reclassified under debt securities. However, if only traded occasionally, the loan is not reclassified under debt securities (IMF, 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lines of credit&lt;/strong&gt; and loan commitments provide a guarantee that undrawn funds will be available in the future, but no financial liability/asset exists until such funds are actually provided. Undrawn lines of credit and undisbursed loan commitments are contingent liabilities of the issuing institutions&amp;#x2014; generally, banks (IMF, 2011). A loan or line of credit refers to regulated financial institutions only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some of the text on concepts and definition may be identical to Metadata submitted for Indicators 9.3.1. &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-1&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</data>
