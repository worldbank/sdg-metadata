	<message>The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 14-a-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data sources: regular direct submission to the GOSR questionnaire/GOSR portal (https://gosr.ioc-unesco.org).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questionnaire used for the first edition of the GOSR was reviewed by the Editorial Board of the GOSR2020 as well as by UIS in 2017/2018 prior to the data collection exercise started in 2018. Assessments from 2018 on were conducted with an improved questionnaire (https://gosr.ioc-unesco.org/methodology).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novelty of the GOSR published for the first time in 2017, and the respective data collection of the 14.a.1 related data, requires the IOC Secretariat to collect the data via its national focal point until now. Future data collections might explore data availability at NSOs. New national reporting mechanisms are being established, which facilitate the provision of the required information (e.g. Colombia, Canada, Italy; document IOC-XXIX/2 Annex 14). The GERD (gross domestic expenditure on research and development) data were obtained from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics/World Bank, based on information directly provided from NSOs.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
