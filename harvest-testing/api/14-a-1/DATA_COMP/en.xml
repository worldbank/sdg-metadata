	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 14-a-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Indicator 14.a.1 = National governmental research expenditure in marine technology / National governmental R&amp;amp;D expenditure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National governmental R&amp;amp;D expenditure data are assessed annually by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National governmental ocean science expenditures are envisaged to be assessed biannually via the GOSR portal (IOC-XXIX/2 Annex 10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of the GOSR data repository/data portal will take place in close collaboration with UIS and IOC (at Headquarters and at the IOC Project Office for IODE, Oostende, Belgium).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
