&lt;p&gt;The proportion of youth (aged 15-24 years) and of adults (aged 15 years and above) who have achieved or exceeded a fixed level of proficiency in (a) literacy and (b) numeracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concepts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;fixed level of proficiency (FLP)&lt;/strong&gt; is the benchmark of basic knowledge in a domain (literacy or numeracy) measured through learning assessments. Currently, the FLP for global reporting is PIAAC level 2 descriptor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concepts of functional literacy and functional numeracy are based on the UNESCO definitions, which cover a continuum of proficiency levels rather than a dichotomy. A person is functionally literate if he/she can engage in all those activities in which literacy is required for the effective functioning of his/her group and community and also which enables them to continue to use reading, writing and calculation for his/her own and the community&amp;#x2019;s development.&lt;/p&gt;
