	<message>The QUALITY_ASSMNT field for indicator 4-6-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The criteria to ensure the quality and standardization of the data are: the data sources must include adequate documentation; data values should be representative at the national population level and should otherwise be included in a footnote; data values are based on a sufficiently large sample; and the data are plausible and based on trends and consistency with previously published or reported estimates for the indicator.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
