	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Sources of differences between global and national figures:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As national agencies are responsible for data collection, no differences between country produced data and international estimated data on the indicator are expected to arise if standard methodologies and procedures are followed at all stages of the reporting process. Missing data and other local variables and frequency of data collection usually affects the figures reported at the global and national level. For this indicator, national data will be used to derive global figures. In instances where global values differ from national figures, efforts will be made for harmonization.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
