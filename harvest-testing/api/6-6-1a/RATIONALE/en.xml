	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 6-6-1a, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Rationale:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target 6.6 aims to &amp;#x201C;protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes&amp;#x201D; through Indicator 6.6.1 which aims to understand how and why these ecosystems are changing in extent over time. All of the different components of Indicator 6.6.1 are important to form a comprehensive picture that enables informed decisions towards the protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems. However, a lack of data within countries to support Indicator 6.6.1 has become clear through the 2017 pilot testing and thus a combination of national data and data based on satellite images is proposed. All data generated is processed using internationally recognized methodologies, resulting in high quality global datasets with extensive spatial and temporal scale.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
