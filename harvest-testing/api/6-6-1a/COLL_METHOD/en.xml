	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Collection process:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sub-Indicators 1 and 2: All globally available data generated for Sub-Indicators 1 and 2 is shared with countries for validation. This geospatial data will be generated annually at national, sub-national, and waterbody scales. While this data is generated annually, the measurement to report change in extent requires validation every five years. Validated annual datasets will be utilized by the custodian agencies to generate percentage changes on behalf of countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sub-Indicators 3, 4, and 5: All data collected within countries for Sub-Indicators 3, 4, and 5 will be submitted to the custodian agencies for review and quality assurance checks against the methodology minimum criteria. This review process will be facilitated via email communication through the global help desk. Once annual &amp;#x2018;raw&amp;#x2019; data is reviewed, percentage change calculations will be completed and validated between the custodian agencies and the national representative. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
