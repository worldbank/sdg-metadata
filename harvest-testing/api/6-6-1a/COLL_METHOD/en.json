{"status":"success","message":"The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 6-6-1a, translated into en","data":"<p>Each sub-indicator (including permanent lakes and river area; seasonal lakes and river area; reservoir minimum and maximum area and water quality; inland wetlands area; mangroves area; lake water quality) is computed separately and thus Indicator 6.6.1 is undertakes several sub-indicator specific computational methods. Globally derived data using spatial area measurements are computed in a comparable and consistent manner across the different ecosystem types e.g. surface water, wetland, mangroves. Globally derived data on water quality is computed using the parameters of turbidity and trophic state to infer a measure of water quality. National data on quantity of water in ecosystems is used to measure stream flow and groundwater volumes. Below are the method descriptions: </p>"}
