	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Concepts and definitions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definition:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator includes five categories: 1) vegetated wetlands, 2) rivers and estuaries, 3) lakes, 4) aquifers, and 5) artificial waterbodies. For purposes of this methodology, the text refers only to these five ecosystem category terminologies. To address its complexity, Indicator 6.6.1 has been divided into 5 Sub-Indicators to capture the various data sources and methodologies required for monitoring components of the Indicator. Data sources come from a combination of ground sampling and earth observations. Depending on the type of ecosystem and the type of extent being measured, the data collection methodology can also differ greatly. A progressive monitoring approach with two levels is proposed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 1: 2 Sub-Indicators based on globally available data from earth observations which will be validated by countries against their own methodologies and datasets: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sub-Indicator 1 &amp;#x2013; spatial extent of water-related ecosystems &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sub-Indicator 2 &amp;#x2013; water quality of lakes and artificial water bodies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Level 2: Data collected by countries through 3 Sub-Indicators:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sub-Indicator 3 &amp;#x2013; quantity of water (discharge) in rivers and estuaries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sub-Indicator 4 &amp;#x2013; water quality imported from SDG Indicator 6.3.2 &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sub-Indicator 5 &amp;#x2013; quantity of groundwater within aquifers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full methodology for this indicator is available in the document entitled, &amp;#x201C;Monitoring Methodology for SDG Indicator 6.6.1&amp;#x201D;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concepts and definitions used in the methodology have been based on existing international frameworks and glossaries unless where indicated otherwise below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Water-related ecosystems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#x2013; includes five categories: 1) vegetated wetlands, 2) rivers and estuaries, 3) lakes, 4) aquifers, and 5) artificial waterbodies. For purposes of this methodology, the text refers only to these five ecosystem category terminologies. The majority of water-related ecosystem types monitored in Indicator 6.6.1 contain freshwater, with the exception of mangroves and estuaries which contain brackish waters and are included in Indicator 6.6.1. Ecosystems containing or within salt waters are not included as these are covered within other SDG indicators (Goal 14). Other categories of wetlands aligning with the Ramsar Convention definitions are captured within the ecosystem category of &amp;#x2018;vegetated wetlands&amp;#x2019;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vegetated Wetlands &amp;#x2013; the water-related ecosystem category of vegetated wetlands includes swamps, fens, peatlands, marshes, paddies, and mangroves. This definition is closely related to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands definition of wetlands, which is: &amp;#x201C;areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres&amp;#x201D; with the exception that salt waters are not included in Indicator 6.6.1 reporting (as they are covered in SDG 14) and with the exception that vegetated wetlands are distinct from the other ecosystem categories of lakes, rivers and estuaries, aquifers, and artificial waterbodies. Vegetated wetlands have been separated as their own ecosystem category because of their importance for target achievement and because the methodology for monitoring them with earth observations is unique from other open waters. The data generated by applying this methodology will also generate data required by countries to report to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artificial Waterbodies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#x2013; the water-related ecosystem category of artificial waterbodies includes open waterbodies created by humans such as reservoirs, canals, harbors, mines and quarries. While it is recognized that these are not traditional water ecosystems which should be protected and restored, in some countries they hold a noteworthy amount of freshwater and have thus been included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#x2013; as any area of surface water unobstructed by aquatic vegetation. This includes the following 3 water-related ecosystem categories: rivers and estuaries, lakes, and artificial waterbodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Extent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#x2013; has been expanded beyond spatial extent to capture additional basic parameters needed for the protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems. Extent includes three components: the spatial extent or surface area, the quality, and the quantity of water-related ecosystems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Change&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#x2013; a shift from one condition of extent to another over time within a water-related ecosystem, measured against a point of reference.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
