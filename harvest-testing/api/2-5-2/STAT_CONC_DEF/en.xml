	<message>The STAT_CONC_DEF field for indicator 2-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Definition: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator presents the percentage of local livestock breeds among local breeds with known risk status classified as being at risk of extinctions at a certain moment in time, as well as the trends for this percentage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concepts: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar indicator was originally proposed for the Target 15.5, and it serves also as an indicator for the Aichi Target 13 &amp;#x201C;Genetic Diversity of Terrestrial Domesticated Animals&amp;#x201D; under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). It is described on the webpage of the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership (BIP), a network of organizations, which have come together to provide the most up-to date biodiversity information possible for tracking progress towards the Aichi Targets (http://www.bipindicators.net/domesticatedanimals). Further, it is presented in the Global Biodiversity Outlook 4, page 91 (see http://www.cbd.int/gbo/gbo4/publication/gbo4-en-lr.pdf) which is an output of the processes under the CBD.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
