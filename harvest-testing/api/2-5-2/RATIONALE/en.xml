	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 2-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The indicator has a direct link to &amp;#x201C;biodiversity&amp;#x201D; as animal or livestock genetic resources represent an integral part of agricultural ecosystems and biodiversity as such. Further there are indirect links to &amp;#x201C;malnutrition&amp;#x201D;: Animal genetic resources for food and agriculture are an essential part of the biological basis for world food security, and contribute to the livelihoods of over a thousand million people. A diverse resource base is critical for human survival and well-being, and a contribution to the eradication of hunger: animal genetic resources are crucial in adapting to changing socio-economic and environmental conditions, including climate change. They are the animal breeder&amp;#x2019;s raw material and amongst the farmer&amp;#x2019;s most essential inputs. They are essential for sustainable agricultural production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No increase of the percentage of breeds being at risk or being extinct is directly related to &amp;#x201C;halt the loss of biodiversity&amp;#x201D;.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
