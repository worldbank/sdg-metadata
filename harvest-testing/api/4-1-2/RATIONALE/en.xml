	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 4-1-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Rationale:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is explicitly referenced in the text of target 4.1: &amp;#x2018;&lt;em&gt;ensure that all girls and boys complete [&amp;#x2026;] primary and secondary education&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#x2019;. A completion rate at or near 100% indicates that all or most children and adolescents have completed a level of education by the time they are 3 to 5 years older than the official age of entry into the last grade of that level of education. A low completion rate indicates low or delayed entry into a given level of education, high drop-out, high repetition, late completion, or a combination of these factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The completion rate can be used either as a self-standing indicator or in combination with SDG indicator 4.1.1 (proportion of children and young people (a) in Grade 2 or 3; (b) at the end of primary education; and (c) at the end of lower secondary education achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics). Combining the completion rate with indicator 4.1.1 provides information on the percentage of children or young people &lt;em&gt;in a cohort&lt;/em&gt; who achieve a minimum level of proficiency, and not only on the percentage of children&lt;em&gt; in school&lt;/em&gt; who achieve minimum proficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
