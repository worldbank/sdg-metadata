{"status":"success","message":"The RATIONALE field for indicator 4-1-2, translated into en","data":"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n<p>The indicator is explicitly referenced in the text of target 4.1: &#x2018;<em>ensure that all girls and boys complete [&#x2026;] primary and secondary education</em>&#x2019;. A completion rate at or near 100% indicates that all or most children and adolescents have completed a level of education by the time they are 3 to 5 years older than the official age of entry into the last grade of that level of education. A low completion rate indicates low or delayed entry into a given level of education, high drop-out, high repetition, late completion, or a combination of these factors.</p>\n<p>The completion rate can be used either as a self-standing indicator or in combination with SDG indicator 4.1.1 (proportion of children and young people (a) in Grade 2 or 3; (b) at the end of primary education; and (c) at the end of lower secondary education achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics). Combining the completion rate with indicator 4.1.1 provides information on the percentage of children or young people <em>in a cohort</em> who achieve a minimum level of proficiency, and not only on the percentage of children<em> in school</em> who achieve minimum proficiency.</p>"}
