	<data>&lt;p&gt;The UNCTAD IIA Navigator is a comprehensive free database of international investment agreements (IIAs). It is primarily built on information provided by governments on a voluntary basis, as well as other reliable sources. The IIA Navigator is continuously adjusted as a result of verification with, and comments from, UN member States. The IIA Navigator contains information on IIAs by country and country grouping, a detailed mapping of the provisions of 2,500 IIAs and a collection of model IIAs. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
