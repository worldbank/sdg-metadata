			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;As explained under data sources, UNCTAD will combine data collected from national authorities with information sourced from international databases and Internet research, as necessary. Once country data have been completed and verified with member States, the indicator will be calculated by aggregating the country data within a specific sub-region, region and globally. Each country that has at least one type of investment promotion regime in place that supports LDCs either directly or through measures intended for developing countries will be counted once for indicator 17.5.1.&lt;/p&gt;
