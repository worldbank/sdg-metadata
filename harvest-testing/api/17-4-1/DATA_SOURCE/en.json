The national data provider of &#x201C;Exports of Goods, and Services&#x201D; is the institution in charge of the collection and compilation of the Balance of Payments statistics. This responsibility varies and is country specific (i.e. Central Bank). World Bank staff estimates for &#x201C;Exports of Goods and Services&#x201D; data are used for gap filling purposes. &#x201C;Exports of Goods and Services&#x201D; data are not reported directly to the World Bank from the national data provider. They are reported to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is the institution in charge of overseeing balance of payment stability as part of its institutional mandate.</p>"}
