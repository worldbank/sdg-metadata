	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 17-19-2b, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Methodology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Computation method:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sub-indicators of the indicator 17.19.2(b) are expressed as proportions: at the global level, the proportion of countries that have achieved 100 per cent birth registration is measured as the number of countries that have achieved 100 per cent birth registration to the total number of countries. The computation is done in an analogous manner for the death registration part as well as for the regional measurements of both birth and death registration sub-indicators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest compiled data for this indicator are part of the Statistical Annex to the 2017 SG&amp;#x2019;s progress report, available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/report/2017/secretary-general-sdg-report-2017--Statistical-Annex.pdf%20&quot;&gt;https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/report/2017/secretary-general-sdg-report-2017--Statistical-Annex.pdf&lt;/a&gt; (please refer to the last two pages). These data are compiled using the country-reported information on availability and completeness of birth and death registration data at the country level, to the United Nations &lt;em&gt;Demographic Yearbook&lt;/em&gt;, via the &lt;em&gt;Demographic Yearbook &lt;/em&gt;Vital Statistics questionnaire and accompanying metadata. United Nations &lt;em&gt;Demographic Yearbook &lt;/em&gt;collection and associated online compilations are published by the United Nations Statistics Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Please refer to: &lt;a href=&quot;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/default.htm&quot;&gt;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/default.htm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the present time, the thresholds used for compiling the data for the indicator 17.19.2(b) are 90 per cent for birth registration and 75 per cent for death registration, due to the classification that has been used in the &lt;em&gt;Demographic Yearbook&lt;/em&gt; metadata questionnaire on vital statistics. This classification has currently been modified to enable reporting according to the exact formulation of the indicator 17.19.2(b).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
