The evaluation and monitoring of quality and completeness of birth and death registration systems are addressed in Part three, sub-Chapters: D. Quality assessment methods; E. Direct versus indirect assessment, and F. Choosing appropriate methods for assessing completeness and qualitative accuracy of registration and register-based vital statistics (para 579 to 622).</p>\n<p>Indicator 17.19.02b has two parts; the first concerning the birth registration and the second concerning the death registration of each individual country or area. </p><p>The national level of completeness of birth and death registration is provided by the National Statistical Offices of all countries and areas to the United Nations Statistics Division as part of the annual data collection for the United Nations Demographic Yearbook. This information is usually reported as part of the metadata worksheets of the Vital Statistics questionnaire.

The essential purpose of civil registration system is to furnish legal documents of direct interest to individuals. Aside from the direct and overarching importance of civil registration to the public authorities, in that the information compiled using the registration method provides essential data for national and regional preparation and planning for medical and health-care programmes, the role played by civil registration in proving, establishing, implementing and realizing many of the human rights embodied in international declarations and conventions reflects one of its most important contributions to the normal functioning of societies.</p><p>The two sub-indicators of the indicator 17.19.02b are expressed as proportions: at the global level, the proportion of countries that have achieved 100 per cent birth registration is measured as the number of countries that have achieved 100 per cent birth registration divided by the total number of countries. The computation is done in an analogous manner for the death registration part as well as for the regional measurements of both birth and death registration sub-indicators. </p>\n<p>The latest compiled data for this indicator are part of the Statistical Annex to the annual SG&#x2019;s progress report, available at https://unstats.un.org/sdgs. These data are compiled using the country-reported information on availability and completeness of birth and death registration data at the country level, to the United Nations Demographic Yearbook, via the Demographic Yearbook Vital Statistics questionnaire and accompanying metadata. United Nations Demographic Yearbook collection and associated online compilations are published by the United Nations Statistics Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs.
