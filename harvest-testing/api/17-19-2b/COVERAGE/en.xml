	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the current availability please refer to the Statistical Annex to the 2017 SG&amp;#x2019;s progress report, available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/report/2017/secretary-general-sdg-report-2017--Statistical-Annex.pdf&quot;&gt;https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/report/2017/secretary-general-sdg-report-2017--Statistical-Annex.pdf&lt;/a&gt; (please refer to the last two pages).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By their definition, the sub-indicators of the indicator 17.19.2(b) refer to the national levels of completeness of birth and death registration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, knowledge of the birth and death registration completeness at sub-national administrative areas, as well as by income, sex, age group, disability status, etc. is very important for monitoring and improving the functioning of birth and death registration systems.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
