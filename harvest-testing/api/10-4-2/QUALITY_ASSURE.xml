			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;In its role as custodian agency of the proposed indicator for SDG 10.4, the World Bank Group is responsible for quality control of and quality assurance over all data submitted to the SDG Indicators Database, as well as the underlying analysis and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice and taking advantage of the proposed partnership between the WBG and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ceqinstitute.org/&quot;&gt;Commitment to Equity Institute&lt;/a&gt; at Tulane University regarding the monitoring of the proposed indicator, the Institute will be responsible for quality control of and quality assurance over the Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicators submitted by the Institute. Similarly, the OECD will be responsible for quality control of and quality assurance over the Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicators submitted by OECD member nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any data reporting outside of the CEQ Institute and OECD, the World Bank will review accompanying technical documentation to confirm that the methodology employed is consistent with that described in Lustig (2018). Where questions arise, the World Bank will engage with the reporting institution to verify the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
