Data compilers will be responsible for compiling the necessary information and documentation in ways that are compliant with the posting requirements described as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The WBG will compile information all Commitment to Equity Assessments conducted by WBG teams and by (non-OECD) national participants working independently. The focus of this exercise will be on assessments conducted in or after 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Commitment to Equity Institute will compile information on all Commitment to Equity Assessments conducted by the Institute. The Institute&amp;#x2019;s submissions to the WBG will include information on pre-fiscal and post-fiscal Gini Indices, information needed to complete the necessary metadata (when available) and do-files needed for replication (when available).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The OECD will compile information on all fiscal assessments conducted by OECD national participants. The OECD&amp;#x2019;s submissions to the WBG will include information on pre-fiscal and post-fiscal Gini Indices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three data compilers will meet periodically to review the reporting and submission process, exchange information on (new) methodological changes, and coordinate on further methodological innovations regarding the Commitment to Equity Assessment as needed. &lt;/p&gt;
