			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;As of February 2021, the Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicator is available from the Commitment to Equity Institute and the World Bank and &lt;em&gt;for at least one year&lt;/em&gt; in 78 countries across the following regions: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;East Asia and the Pacific: 11&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Europe and Central Asia: 38&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Latin America and the Caribbean: 10&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Middle East and North Africa: 3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;North America: 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;East Asia Pacific: 11&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sub-Saharan Africa: 14&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is available for 34 of the 37 OECD member countries for Pre-fiscal and Disposable Income only. Data are available annually (with the exception of countries whose income survey is fielded every two or three years) through the OECD Income Distribution Database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time series:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicator is currently &lt;em&gt;for the most part&lt;/em&gt; available for single country/year pairs only. The main limitation to producing more frequent time series is the availability of more frequent household surveys. However, that is also a limitation faced by other SDG indicators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicator can be shown separately for as many different subgroups as are represented in the survey or micro-data from which it is drawn: income subgroups; by gender, age group, ethnic grouping; geographic location; disability status, household size; household dependency ratios, and so on. These are frequently reported in the main CEQ studies which the SDG indicators are drawn from but not reported within the SG database itself.&lt;/p&gt;
