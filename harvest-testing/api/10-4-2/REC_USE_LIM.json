{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 10-4-2, translated into all languages","data":{"ar":"","en":"<p>Reporting on assumptions: The choice of whether to report the <u>Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy</u> indicator under the pensions as deferred income or pensions as transfers scenario will be left to the country authority or international agency in charge of submitting this indicator, <em>but the choice must be clearly indicated in the reporting document.</em> For countries for which the data exist, pre-fiscal and post-fiscal inequality should be calculated for both pension scenarios, and the default included in the SDGs database is pension as deferred income. If only data treating pensions as transfers are available, it is recommended to report them only for the working age population (under 65 years of age). Some authorities may also choose to use equivalized income instead of per capita income as the welfare indicator. This too should be clearly indicated in the reporting document. Last, some authorities may report these data based on a micro-data set using income or expenditure as the relevant welfare concept. Once these decisions are taken, they should be maintained in subsequent years in order to assure comparability, except that all countries are encouraged to provide data with pension as deferred income. The data reported in the UN Global Database try, to the extent possible, to distinguish between the different concepts used for different countries.</p>\n<p>Feasibility: The Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicator can be estimated for any country with a micro-data set detailing incomes or expenditures (or both) at the household or individual level and with a set of fiscal, administrative, or budgetary records detailing public expenditures at the program level and revenue collections at the revenue-collection instrument level.</p>\n<p>Suitability/Relevance: The Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicator provides a direct estimate of the current impact of fiscal policy on redistribution (of incomes). It therefore provides a direct estimate of progress on SDG Target 10.4: &#x201C;<strong>Adopt policies, especially fiscal</strong>, wage <strong>and social protection policies</strong>, <strong>and progressively achieve greater equality</strong>.&#x201D; </p>\n<p>Limitations: The Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicator does not address wage policy. It does not include the benefits of public provision of in-kind benefits, such as health, education, sanitation and housing services, which may have both present-day and longer-term impacts on present-day and future inequality. </p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
