	<message>The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 2-2-3, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Once survey data are compiled and the Bayesian hierarchical mixture model is run to generate anaemia estimates, countries are sent a memorandum to provide a background to the estimates and explain the process. Information on the survey data used to generate the estimates for that country, estimates for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2019, and the resulting plots for each country are provided along with an explanation of the methodology used in generating the estimates. Countries are requested to provide feedback within six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
