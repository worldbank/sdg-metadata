	<message>The DATA_SOURCE field for indicator 2-2-3, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;There are two main data sources of survey data for anaemia: 1) reports generated by countries or implementing partners and 2) published manuscripts. Occasionally, Member States, regional offices, the international community or colleagues managing other databases within WHO provide reports directly to staff responsible for maintaining the WHO Micronutrients Database. If data meet the eligibility criteria, they are entered into the database. Reports and publications are primarily requested and collected from: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ministries of Health through WHO regional and country offices, &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;National research and academic institutions,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nongovernmental organizations, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organizations of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unsceb.org/directory&quot;&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; system. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</data>
