As a result, the estimates may not capture the full variation across countries and regions, tending to &#x201C;shrink&#x201D; towards global means when data are sparse. Additionally, it was not possible to incorporate into the analyses some potentially important predictors of blood haemoglobin concentration, especially dietary iron and iron supplementation, because of limited data.</p>"}
