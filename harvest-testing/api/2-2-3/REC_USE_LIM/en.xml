	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Comments and limitations:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the extensive data search, data for blood haemoglobin concentrations are still limited, compared to other nutritional indicators such as child anthropometry (1, 24); this was especially true in the high-income countries of the WHO European Region. As a result, the estimates may not capture the full variation across countries and regions, tending to &amp;#x201C;shrink&amp;#x201D; towards global means when data are sparse. Additionally, it was not possible to incorporate into the analyses some potentially important predictors of blood haemoglobin concentration, especially dietary iron and iron supplementation, because of limited data.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
