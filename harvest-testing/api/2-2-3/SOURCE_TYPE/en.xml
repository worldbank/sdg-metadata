&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preferable source of data is population-based surveys, followed by data from surveillance systems. In some cases, anonymized individual-level data are obtained from multi-country surveys, including demographic and health surveys, multiple indicator cluster surveys, reproductive health surveys and malaria indicator surveys. However, the Micronutrients Database of the WHO Vitamin and Mineral Information System (VMNIS) (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/vmnis/database/en/&quot;&gt;https://www.who.int/vmnis/database/en/&lt;/a&gt;) compiles and summarizes data on the micronutrient status of populations from various other sources, including data collected from the scientific literature and through collaborators, including WHO regional and country offices, United Nations organizations, ministries of health, research and academic institutions, and nongovernmental organizations.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
