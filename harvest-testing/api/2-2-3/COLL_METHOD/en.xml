	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Collection process:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A PubMed search was carried out for relevant search terms related to anaemia, haemoglobin and iron status, searching for studies published after 1 January 1990. In addition to indexed articles, many reports of national and international agencies were identified and accessed through requests to each corresponding organization. Once survey data are compiled and the Bayesian hierarchical mixture model is run to generate anaemia estimates, countries are sent a memorandum to provide a background to the estimates and explain the process. Information on the survey data used to generate the estimates for that country, estimates for the year 2015, and the resulting plots for each country are provided along with an explanation of the methodology used in generating the estimates. Countries are requested to provide feedback within six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
