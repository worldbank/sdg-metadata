While we see no issues in terms of the feasibility and suitability of 17.1.2 for cross-country comparisons, we question the relevance of one single global indicator that combines data for advanced economies with those of emerging market and low income countries. </p>\n<p>For reporting this indicator, budgetary central government is considered the most appropriate level of institutional coverage as it will encompass all countries. In principle, GFS should cover all entities that materially affect fiscal policies. However, for most developing and many emerging market economies compiling data for the consolidated general government and its subsectors is problematic owing to limitations in the availability and/or timeliness of source data. A country may have one central government; several state, provincial, or regional governments; and many local governments, and the GFSM 2014 recommends that statistics should be compiled for all such general government units. This reporting structure is illustrated below:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are some countries that report &#x201C;consolidated central government&#x201D; without necessarily providing the budgetary central government subsector separately. The IMF intends to provide data for the budgetary central government and will work to address this issue, where needed, as outlined under section 5, above.</p>"}
