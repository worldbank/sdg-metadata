	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 17-1-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current data availability / indicator tier:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classification of the indicator into one of the following three tiers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend that 17.1.2 remain classified as Tier 1: The indicator is conceptually clear and standards are available. The underlying data are regularly produced by countries, and there is current data available. From the IAEG-SDGs Tier Classification description at &lt;a href=&quot;https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/tier-classification/&quot;&gt;https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/tier-classification/&lt;/a&gt;, a key criteria is that &amp;#x201C;data are regularly produced by countries for at least 50 per cent of countries&amp;#x201D;. The IMF GFS database, with 110+ regular annual reporting countries using the same reporting format certainly meets this key criteria. All IMF member countries produce revenue (and expenditure) data for surveillance purposes. In the current (2017) round of soliciting annual GFS series from countries, we have specifically encouraged those countries that were non-reporters over the past few years to (at a minimum) provide the key revenue and expenditure series needed to monitor 17.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General government units have four types of revenue: (i) compulsory levies in the form of taxes and certain types of social contributions; (ii) property income derived from the ownership of assets; (iii) sales of goods and services; and (iv) other transfers receivable from other units. Of these, compulsory levies and transfers are considered the main sources of revenue for most general government units (GFSM 2014 paragraph 5.1). These four types of revenue are represented by the following aggregates: Taxes, Social contributions, Grants, Other revenue. Similarly, the economic classification of expense identifies eight types of expense incurred according to the economic process involved. For example, compensation of employees, use of goods and services, and consumption of fixed capital all relate to the costs of producing nonmarket (and, in certain instances, market) goods and services by government. Subsidies, grants, social benefits, and transfers other than grants relate to transfers in cash or in kind, and are aimed at redistributing income and wealth. The functional classification of expense provides information on the purpose for which an expense was incurred. Examples of functions are education, health, and environmental protection. The detailed GFS classification structure used in the annual questionnaire that is used by countries to report data allows for sufficient disaggregation for compiling 17.1.2.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
