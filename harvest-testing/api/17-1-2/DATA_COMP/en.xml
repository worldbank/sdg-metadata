	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 17-1-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;GFS budgetary central government revenue series - collected in Table 1 of the annual data questionnaire provided to all countries - will be combined with series on budgetary central government expenditure (actual execution of the main budget) on &amp;#x201C;expense&amp;#x201D; plus the &amp;#x201C;net acquisition of nonfinancial assets&amp;#x201D;, as defined in &lt;em&gt;GFSM 2014&lt;/em&gt;). GFS Expenditure series are reported by the economic classification in Tables 2, and 3 (items under code 31). Alternatively, for those countries that report total expenditure according to the functional classification (COFOG) in GFS Table 7, a similar calculation can be made. The &lt;em&gt;Proportion of domestic budgetary central government expenditure funded by taxes&lt;/em&gt; will be calculated as (Taxes / Expenditure expressed as a %) using the following data series:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistency across countries will be ensured through the underlying structure of the IMF GFS database and application of one simple mathematical formulas to make computations on the country reported source data used to produce the indicator (no adjustments and/or weighting techniques will be applied). Mixed sources are not being used nor will the calculation change over time (i.e., there are no discontinuities in the underlying series as these are key aggregates/ components in all country reported GFS series).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
