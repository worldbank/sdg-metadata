	<data>&lt;p&gt;The ILO produces global and regional estimates of employment by economic class (and thus, of working poverty rates) using the ILO&amp;#x2019;s Employment by Class (EbyC) model. These estimates are part of the ILO Estimates and Projections series, analysed in the ILO&amp;apos;s World Employment and Social Outlook reports. For more information, on the model used to derive these estimates, refer to the ILO paper &amp;#x201C;Employment and economic class in the developing world&amp;#x201D; (Kapsos and Bourmpoula, 2013), available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---inst/documents/publication/wcms_216451.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---inst/documents/publication/wcms_216451.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
