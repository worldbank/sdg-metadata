&lt;p&gt;The common source data are data reported by banks for supervisory purposes. National supervisors check and validate the data that are used by national FSI compilers. IMF staff check the FSIs reported by countries before posting on the FSI website and address data issues in collaboration with the national compilers whenever such issues are flagged by the validation and consistency checks implemented in the IMF data processing system. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
