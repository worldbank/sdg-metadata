	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 10-5-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of end-December 2018, there were 138 FSI reporters. All countries report all or most core FSIs and some encouraged FSIs that can be used to support the interpretation of these seven SDG indicators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time series:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data for most countries are reported on a monthly or quarterly basis; a few countries report data on a semi-annual basis and with a lag of more than a quarter. Data are available as far back as 2005 for some countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSIs disseminated by the IMF are weighted averages for the sector as a whole (e.g., deposit takers, other financial corporations, nonfinancial corporations). Data for parent banks, their branches, and relevant subsidiaries are consolidated; if this consolidation is not possible or not applicable, an explanation is provided in the metadata. There are no disaggregated breakdowns of the FSIs reported to the IMF.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
