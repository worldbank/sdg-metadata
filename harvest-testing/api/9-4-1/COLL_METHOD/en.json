Additionally, missing years for countries with at least one data point for GDP reported by the World Bank have been estimated using National Accounts &#x2013; Analysis of Main Aggregates (AMA) growth rates.</p>\n<p>For the calculation of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from manufacturing industries per unit of MVA indicator, the MVA and GDP country data are collected through a national accounts questionnaire (NAQ) sent by UNSD.
