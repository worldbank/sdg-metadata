	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Quality assurance:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IEA has extensive data quality checks on the energy data submissions (around 30 statisticians working on it), and iterates with countries on data issues and how to address them. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iea.org/statistics/resources/questionnaires/annual/&quot;&gt;http://www.iea.org/statistics/resources/questionnaires/annual/&lt;/a&gt;. The IEA also works in cooperation with the IPCC and the UNFCCC to ensure the highest consistency between international methodologies and methodologies adopted at the IEA; the IEA validates energy data submitted to the UNFCCC by countries within their inventories. The IEA convenes international workshops among partner Agencies working on energy data to ensure consistency between energy data at global level is enhanced continuously, and methodologies are harmonised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IEA has an extensive data quality assurance and validation process through exchange with national data providers worldwide. It also convenes its Energy Statistics Development Group meeting to discuss energy statistics developments with its Members, and cooperates with partners worldwide to ensure coherence of data and methods.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
