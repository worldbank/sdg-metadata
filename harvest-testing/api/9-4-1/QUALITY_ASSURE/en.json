The IEA convenes international workshops among partner Agencies working on energy data to ensure consistency between energy data at global level is enhanced continuously, and methodologies are harmonised.</p>\n<p>The IEA has an extensive data quality assurance and validation process through exchange with national data providers worldwide. It also convenes its Energy Statistics Development Group meeting to discuss energy statistics developments with its Members, and cooperates with partners worldwide to ensure coherence of data and methods.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/unsystem/Documents/QAF-UNIDO.pdf\">The UNIDO Quality Assurance Framework</a> is followed to ensure that the statistical activities of UNIDO are relevant and the data compiled and disseminated are accurate, complete within the defined scope and coverage, timely, comparable in terms of internationally recommended methods and classification standards and internally coherent to variables included in the datasets. While these generally accepted, broad dimensions of quality of statistical data may be defined in each NSO&apos;s own quality assurance framework, UNIDO makes maximum effort that data produced from the statistical operation undertaken with the UNIDO technical cooperation are accurate, internationally comparable and coherent.</p>"}
