	<data>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; At country level&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providing all the elements of energy balance, underlying the IEA CO&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;emissions estimations has often required estimations. Estimations have been generally made after consultation with national statistical offices, energy companies, utilities and national energy experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; At regional and global levels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the compilation of the IEA energy balances which are the underlying for estimating the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and in addition to estimates at a country level, adjustments addressing differences in definitions alongside estimations for informal and/or confidential trade, production or stock changes of energy products are sometimes required to complete major aggregates, when key statistics are missing. Such estimations and adjustments implemented by IEA have been generally made after consultation with national statistical offices, energy companies, utilities and national energy experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No imputation is provided if values are missing for the entire country or the region. It can only be projected from the data reported for previous years.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
