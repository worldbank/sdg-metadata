	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 6-a-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Rationale:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of water and sanitation-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) is a quantifiable measurement as a proxy for &amp;#x201C;international cooperation and capacity development support&amp;#x201D; in financial terms. It is essential to be able to assess ODA in proportion with how much of it is included in the government budget to gain a better understanding of whether donors are aligned with national governments while highlighting total water and sanitation ODA disbursements to developing countries over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A low value of this indicator (near 0%) would suggest that international donors are investing in water and sanitation related activities and programmes in the country outside the purview of the national government. A high value (near 100%) would indicate that donors are aligned with national government and national policies and plans for water and sanitation.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
