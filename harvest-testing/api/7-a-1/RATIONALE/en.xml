	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 7-a-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Total ODA and OOF flows to developing countries quantify the public financial effort (excluding export credits) that donors provide to developing countries for renewable energies. The additional flows (from the IRENA database) capture the flows to non-ODA Recipients in developing regions, flows from countries and institutions not currently reporting to the DAC and certain other types of flows, such as export credits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy access is a major development constraint in many developing countries and, while starting from a relatively low base, energy demand is expected to grow very rapidly in many of these countries in the future. This presents an opportunity for developing countries to utilize clean and renewable technologies to meet their future energy needs if they can gain access to the appropriate technologies and expertise. This indicator provides a suitable measure of the international support given to developing countries to access these technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
