			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The OECD DAC Mandate states that the overarching objective of the DAC for the period 2018-2022 is to promote development co-operation and other relevant policies so as to contribute to implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, poverty eradication, improvement of living standards in developing countries, and to a future in which no country will depend on aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to achieve this overarching objective, the Committee shall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) monitor, assess, report, and promote the provision of resources that support sustainable development by collecting and analysing data and information on ODA and other official and private flows, in a transparent way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a mandate from countries around the world, IRENA encourages governments to adopt enabling policies for renewable energy investments, provides practical tools and policy advice to accelerate renewable energy deployment, and facilitates knowledge sharing and technology transfer to provide clean, sustainable energy for the world&amp;#x2019;s growing population. Collecting official statistics (including international public finance flows) is in line with these aims. &lt;/p&gt;
