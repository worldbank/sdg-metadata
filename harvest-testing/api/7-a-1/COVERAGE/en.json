{"status":"success","message":"The COVERAGE field for indicator 7-a-1, translated into en","data":"<h1>Data availability</h1>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n<p>The CRS contains flows to all DAC recipient countries. Global and regional figures are based on the sum of ODA and OOF flows to the renewable energy projects.</p>\n<p>IRENA currently includes data about renewable energy projects in 29 developed countries and 104 developing countries (133 countries overall).</p>\n<h2>Time series:</h2>\n<p><strong><em>OECD</em></strong>: annual data from 1960 onwards (see above). </p>\n<p><strong><em>IRENA:</em></strong> annual data from 2000 onwards.</p>\n<h2>Disaggregation:</h2>\n<p>Data in the CRS contain markers which reflect whether a policy objective is attained through the activity. Measuring gender equality is included in the CRS. Data from the CRS are reported at the project level and can be disaggregated by type of flow (ODA or OOF), by donor, recipient country, type of finance, type of aid (project, agriculture sub-sector, etc.).</p>\n<p>Data in IRENA are stored by country (source and recipient) at the project-level, allowing disaggregation of the data in several dimensions. For example, financial flows can be divided by technologies (i.e. bioenergy, geothermal energy, hydropower, ocean energy, solar energy, and wind energy) and sub-technologies (e.g. onshore and offshore wind), by geography (both at the country and regional level), by financial instrument and by type of recipient.</p>"}
