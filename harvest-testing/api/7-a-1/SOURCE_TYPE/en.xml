&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OECD/DAC has been collecting data on official and private resource flows from 1960 at an aggregate level and 1973 at an activity level through the Creditor Reporting System (CRS data are considered complete from 1995 for commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements). Data are reported on an annual calendar year basis by statistical reporters in national administrations (aid agencies, Ministries of Foreign Affairs or Finance, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IRENA&amp;#x2019;s data on financial flows from public sources in support of renewable energy are available in IRENA&amp;#x2019;s Public Renewable Energy Investment Database. IRENA collects this data from a wide range of publicly available sources, including the databases and annual reports of all of the main development finance institutions and 20 other bilateral and multilateral agencies investing in renewable energy. The database is updated annually and (at end-2016) covers public renewable energy investment flowing to 29 developed countries and 104 developing countries, for the period 2000-2015. As new publicly-funded financial institutions start investing in renewable energy, the IRENA database will expand to include these new investors over time.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
