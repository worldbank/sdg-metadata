	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 16-10-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;To report on the number of countries that adopted the guarantees, data collected through the survey instrument are triangulated by a desk research. The data, which include years of adoption of such guarantees, are monitored and updated annually to reflect changes, such as: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; whether a country just passed a guarantee for Access to Information; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; whether a country amended its existing guarantee(s) for Access to Information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel, to link the data on adoption above with the implementation aspect, and to measure the component of implementation at national level, UNESCO collects data directly from countries and their territories via the Survey on Public Access to Information (SDG Indicator 16.10.2). &lt;/p&gt;</data>
