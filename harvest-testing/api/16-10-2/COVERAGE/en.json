{"status":"success","message":"The COVERAGE field for indicator 16-10-2, translated into en","data":"<h1>Data availability</h1>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n<p>Data on the existence of freedom of information laws are available for at least 195 countries. However, for future data collection and analysis, efforts are underway to ensure that the data is analyzed to yield information on aspects relating to how FOI laws are actually &quot;implemented&quot;, rather than just their existence.</p>\n<h2>Disaggregation:</h2>\n<p>The indicator can be disaggregated in terms of the extent to which the residence of citizens affects their ability to access information (e.g. how do rural, peri-rural, urban and peri-urban dwellers access information from public bodies). It can also be disaggregated in terms of whether gender influences ability to access information. Furthermore, aspects of how disability affects public access to information can also be assessed.</p>"}
