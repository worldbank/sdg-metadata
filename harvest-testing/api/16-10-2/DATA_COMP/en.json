and obtained 1 point</li>\n  <li>Question 2: responded &#x2018;YES&#x2019; and obtained 1 point</li>\n  <li>Question 3: responded &#x2018;NO&#x2019; and obtained 0 point</li>\n  <li>Question 4: selected three of five options provided. Each answer has 0.2 point, so it obtained 0.6 point. </li>\n  <li>Question 5: responded &#x2018;NO&#x2019; and obtained 0 point. </li>\n  <li>Question 6: selected four of five options provided. Each answer has 0.4 point and obtained 1.6 point. </li>\n  <li>Question 7: responded &#x2018;NO and obtained 0 point</li>\n  <li>Question 8: responded &#x2018;YES and obtained 1 point</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Therefore, Country X obtained a total score of 5.2. This score will not be assigned to any level category (e.g.: low, medium or high). However, it will contribute to global aggregates, in which data will be interpreted using the sum formula to show trends. </p>\n<p>Below is an example of how responses to the survey are used in the interpretation of a global aggregate that illustrate a trend in the &#x201C;Record keeping and reporting&#x201D; principle: </p>\n<p>Out of 100 countries that responded to UNESCO Survey on Public Access to Information (SDG Indicator 16.10.2), 80% have oversight institutions on Access to Information (ATI). However, only 50% of them keep records of appeals with regards RTI requests. This flags the need for improvement, as good record-keeping is vital for evidence-based reporting, which can provide many advantages for improving ATI. Without adequate and reliable records of the requests received and how they are processed, it is difficult to produce evidence and measure progress. </p>\n<p>In addition, where applicable, supplementary data will be collected through follow-up questions, which will not be scored and will be used to contextualize UNESCO&#x2019;s analysis. The follow-up questions are as follow:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Question 1<ul>\n      <li>If responded &#x2018;YES&#x2019;: What are the guarantees (by type &#x2013; primary legislation, secondary legislation/regulation, binding policy document, etc)?</li>\n      <li>If responded &#x2018;NO&#x2019;: Are there still any non-binding policies on Access to Information (Public Statement such Open Government Partnership Action Plan; Strategy such as in Open Government/Open Data/ Open Access; Master or Action Plan/ SOP/ protocols/ digital or e-government policies relating to implementation of ATI; or Others) - then &#x2018;End survey&#x2019;. </li>\n      <li>If responded &#x2018;IN PROGRESS&#x2019;: Please explain - then &#x2018;End survey&#x2019;</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Question 2, if responded &#x2018;YES&#x2019;: <ul>\n      <li>\n        <ol>\n          <li>What is it / are they?
