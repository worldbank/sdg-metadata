	<data>&lt;p&gt;For developing countries, classification is based on SDG grouping provided by the UN Statistical Office (regional classification, LDCs, LLDCs, SIDS). Income classification follows the World Bank grouping (low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high income).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For development partners, classification is based on SDG grouping. In addition, bilateral partners can be distinguished between members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and non-members. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
