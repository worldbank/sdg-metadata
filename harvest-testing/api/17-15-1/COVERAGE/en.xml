	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 17-15-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data availability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data collected in the 2016 and 2018 monitoring round generated data for a total of 96 recipient countries and for above 100 development partners &amp;#x2013;including the 29 countries that are members of the OECD&amp;#x2019;s Development Assistance Committee and the six major multilateral organizations in terms of development finance (i.e. the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations Development Programme, African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time series:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the bottom-up approach in generating the indicator, disaggregation is possible at the country level and at the development partner level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While data collection is led at the country level, in a bottom-up approach, global and regional aggregates can be used for monitoring internationally-agreed commitments related to strengthening country ownership and better partner alignment with nationally-set development goals. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
