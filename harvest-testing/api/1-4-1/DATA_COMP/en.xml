	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 1-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;This indicator is a combination of various components of basic services which on their own are already existing as standalone indicators of the SDGs. As a result, the team of experts advised and agreed that these should be presented as a dashboard. Their metadata provide the specific methodologies for computing these indicators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data presentation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual components of access to basic services will be computed separately from various data sources over the years. However, the dashboard will be configured to display the most recent data points, but with the possibility to visualize data for older years through a drill down access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data will be presented or visualized as a dashboard but with the possibility to map it out through various visualization tools such as spider web of the achievement of access to different basic services in a country through plotting the various components of the indicators. In this way, policy makers can be informed of most needed intervention areas for any region and country. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
