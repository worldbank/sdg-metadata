	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 12-b-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While SEEA and TSA tables are currently not compiled everywhere, ALL countries are able to provide information on this indicator. Those States where no tables are compiled report a value of zero (0). In the first data collection exercise initiated in 2019, UNWTO received over 100 country responses. These include countries in all regions. The data has already been uploaded on the SDG Global Database. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time series:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is available from 2008 onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disaggregation of the different TSA tables and SEEA tables (water flows, energy flows, GHG emissions and solid waste), and disaggregation by standard (TSA and SEEA), will be possible. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
