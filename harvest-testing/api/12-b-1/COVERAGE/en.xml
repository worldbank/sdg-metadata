	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data availability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While SEEA and TSA tables are currently not compiled everywhere, ALL countries are able to provide information on this indicator. Those States where no tables are compiled report a value of zero (0). There are currently (as of March 2021) data available for over 150 countries,in all regions. The data has already been uploaded on the SDG Global Database. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time series:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is available from 2008 onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disaggregation of the different TSA tables and SEEA tables (water flows, energy flows, GHG emissions and solid waste), and disaggregation by standard (TSA and SEEA), will be possible. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
