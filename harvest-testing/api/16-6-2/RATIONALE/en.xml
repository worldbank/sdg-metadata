	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 16-6-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Governments have an obligation to provide a wide range of public services that should meet the expectations of their citizens in terms of access, responsiveness and reliability/quality. When citizens cannot afford some essential services, when their geographic or electronic access to services and information is difficult, when the services provided do not respond to their needs and are of poor quality, citizens will naturally tend to report lower satisfaction not only with these services, but also with public institutions and governments. In this regard, it has been shown that citizens&amp;#x2019; experience with front-line public services affects their trust in public institutions (OECD 2017, &lt;em&gt;Trust and Public Policy &amp;#x2013; How Better Governance Can Help Rebuild Public Trust; Eurofound 2018, Societal change and trust in institutions&lt;/em&gt;). Mindful of this close connection between service provision/performance, citizen satisfaction and public trust, governments are increasingly interested in better understanding citizens&amp;#x2019; needs, experiences and preferences to be able to provide better targeted services, including for underserved populations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measuring satisfaction with public services is at the heart of a citizen-centered approach to service delivery and an important outcome indicator of overall government performance. Yet while a large number of countries have experience with measuring citizen satisfaction with public services, there is also large variability in the ways national statistical offices and government agencies in individual countries collect data in this area, in terms of the range of services included, the specific attributes of services examined, question wording and response formats, among other methodological considerations. This variability poses a significant challenge for cross-country comparison of such data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SDG indicator 16.6.2 aims to generate globally comparable data on satisfaction with public services. To this end, SDG 16.6.2 focuses global reporting on the three service areas of (1) healthcare, (2) education and (3) government services (i.e. services to obtain government-issued identification documents and services for the civil registration of life events such as births, marriages and deaths.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rationale for selecting these three public services is threefold: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First, these are &amp;#x2018;services of consequence&amp;#x2019;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-12&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-12&quot;&gt;[11]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, salient for all countries and for both rural and urban populations within countries. They are also among the most common service areas&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;covered by national household or citizen surveys on satisfaction with public services&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-13&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-13&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Second, while healthcare and education services are covered by other SDG indicators&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-14&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-14&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, most of these other indicators rely on administrative sources (i.e. they do not measure people&amp;#x2019;s direct experiences and level of satisfaction with services) and are mainly focused on measuring the national coverage of a given service. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Third, government services are not monitored under other Goals. This is a gap that indicator 16.6.2 can usefully fill, especially since Goal 16 is dedicated to enhancing governance. While Goal 16 does consider birth registration services under indicator 16.9.1, it falls short of measuring satisfaction with the services provided. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the aim of generating harmonized statistics, indicator 16.6.2 is measured through five attributes-based questions under each service area (e.g. on the accessibility and affordability of the service, the quality of facilities, etc.):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The attributes-based questions are asked &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the overall satisfaction question. This is based on the intention to enhance the accuracy of the proposed statistical measure on overall satisfaction &amp;#x2013; that is, to ensure that it correctly reflects the underlying concept that it is intended to capture (based on the specific attributes selected for each service). Experts in governance measurements have found that citizen satisfaction with public services is influenced not only by citizens&amp;#x2019; previous experiences with the services, but also by citizens&amp;#x2019; expectations&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-15&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-15&quot;&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. These can be influenced by cultural assumptions about the extent to which service providers should be responsive to citizens&amp;#x2019; preferences; by broad public perception of services as communicated through the media; by individual experiences of friends, family and acquaintances; and by how service providers themselves communicate about the type of services they commit to delivering. For instance, national experiences with different question formats have shown that more highly educated respondents who interact more frequently with government (and who possibly have higher awareness of their own rights and of their government&amp;#x2019;s obligations) have higher expectations in terms of what constitutes a public service of &amp;#x2018;good quality&amp;#x2019;, compared to the rest of the population&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-16&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-16&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Given these multiple influences over citizen expectations of public services, which differ across different national contexts and across different demographic groups, it is essential for this methodology to foster a common understanding among respondents of which aspects of &amp;#x2018;good quality&amp;#x2019; service provision are measured. To this end, this methodology &amp;#x2018;primes&amp;#x2019; respondents with a common set of attributes of &amp;#x2018;good quality&amp;#x2019; service provision prior to asking about their overall satisfaction. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;National experiences have also shown that asking attributes-based questions prior to an overall satisfaction question helps respondents recall their last experience with more specificity.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-17&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-17&quot;&gt;[16]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A key reference used to identify relevant attributes for each service area covered by SDG 16.6.2 is the OECD Serving Citizens Framework (OECD 2015, Government at a Glance), which measures the quality of public services delivered to citizens by assessing three key dimensions of service provision, namely Access&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-18&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-18&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, Responsiveness&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-19&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-19&quot;&gt;[18]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and Reliability/Quality&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-20&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-20&quot;&gt;[19]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Each one of these three dimensions is then further assessed with specific attributes. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The list of attributes in the OECD Serving Citizens Framework is comprehensive and more than a global indicator can feasibly and usefully cover. SDG 16.6.2, therefore, focuses on a limited subset of attributes. The specific set of five attributes used by SDG 16.6.2 to measure satisfaction with healthcare and education service areas was selected on the basis of statistical analysis performed on accessible datasets on satisfaction with these two services, namely from the Afrobarometer and the European Quality of Life Survey. Regression and cluster analysis were conducted on these two datasets to determine the main &amp;#x2018;drivers&amp;#x2019; of overall satisfaction among several such attributes, for healthcare and education services&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-21&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-21&quot;&gt;[20]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The below table presents the results of this empirical analysis &amp;#x2013; that is, the subset of five attributes used by SDG 16.6.2 to assess satisfaction in each service area:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Attributes-specific questions aim to be specifically informative for national policymaking. The specificity of the information generated by such questions, as well as the focus on citizen &lt;em&gt;experiences&lt;/em&gt; rather than simply perceptions, have greater policy use than stand-alone perception data on overall satisfaction, which may not reveal &amp;#x201C;what needs to be fixed&amp;#x201D;. &lt;/li&gt;
