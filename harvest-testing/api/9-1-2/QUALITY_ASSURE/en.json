Significant correspondence is undertaken with the countries over potential errors, and common issues and challenges are discussed at both the ITF annual statistics meeting and the UNECE&#x2019;s annual Working Party on Transport Statistics.</p>\n<p>A common problem for many countries is that passenger-km are only collected for public transport. Given that private passenger cars form the majority of passenger trips in most countries, this would clearly significantly underestimate road passenger-km, which is why the breakdown where available between passenger cars, buses and motorcycles is given. </p>"}
