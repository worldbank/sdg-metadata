	<message>The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 9-2-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The preferred official national data source for this indicator is a household-based labour force survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a labour force survey, a population census and/or other type of household survey with an appropriate employment module may also be used to obtain the required data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where no household survey exists, establishment surveys or some types of administrative records may be used to derive the required data, keeping into account the limitations of these sources in their coverage. Specifically, these sources may exclude some types of establishments, establishments of certain sizes, some economic activities or some geographical areas.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
