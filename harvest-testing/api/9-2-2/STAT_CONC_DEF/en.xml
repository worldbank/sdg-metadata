	<data>&lt;p&gt;Definitions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator presents the share of manufacturing employment in total employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concepts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employment comprises all persons of working age who during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The working-age population is usually defined as all persons aged 15 and above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For further clarification, see: Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization (2013), available from &lt;a href=&quot;http://ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm&quot;&gt;http://ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No distinction is made between persons employed full time and those working less than full time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manufacturing sector is defined according to the International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC) revision 4 (2008, the latest) or revision 3 (1990). It refers to industries belonging to sector C in revision 4 or sector D in revision 3.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
