The ICD-10 codes corresponding to the indicator includes X40, X43-X44, X46-X49.</p><h1>Data sources</h1>\n<h2>Description:</h2>\n<p>Data inputs to the estimate include (a) data on WASH services and practices, and (b) cause-of-death data, of which the preferred data source is death registration systems with complete coverage and medical certification of cause of death. Other possible data sources include household surveys with verbal autopsy, sample or sentinel registration systems, special studies and surveillance systems.</p><h2>Collection process:</h2>\n<p>WHO collects data directly from country sources, and following established method, estimates are shared with countries to receive their feedback before publication. See Indicator 6.1 above for more details.</p><h1>Calendar</h1>\n<h2>Data collection:</h2>\n<p>Ongoing </p><h2>Data release:</h2>\n<p>End of 2016 </p><h1>Data providers</h1>\n<p>National statistics offices, various line ministries and databases covering civil registration with complete coverage and medical certification of cause of death.</p><h1>Data compilers</h1>\n<p>WHO</p><h2>Rationale:</h2>\n<p>Measuring how the mortality rate from unintentional poisonings provides an indication of the extent of inadequate management of hazardous chemicals and pollution, and of the effectiveness of a country&#x2019;s health system. </p><h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n<p>Data on deaths are widely available from countries from death registration data or sample registration systems, which are feasible systems, but good quality data are not yet available in all countries. Such data are crucial for improving health and reducing preventable deaths in countries. For countries that do not have such registration systems, data need to be completed with other types of information.</p><h1>Methodology</h1>\n<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n<p>The methods with agreed international standards have been developed, reviewed and published in various documents.</p>\n<p>The methods used for the analysis of causes of death depend on the type of data available from countries. </p>\n<p>For countries with a high-quality vital registration system including information on cause of death, the vital registration that member states submit to the WHO Mortality Database were used, with adjustments where necessary, e.g. for under-reporting of deaths.</p>\n<p>For countries without high-quality death registration data, cause of death estimates are calculated using other data, including household surveys with verbal autopsy, sample or sentinel registration systems, special studies and surveillance systems. In most cases, these data sources are combined in a modelling framework.</p>\n<p>Complete methodology may be found here: <a href=\"http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GlobalCOD_method_2000_2012.pdf?ua=1\">http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GlobalCOD_method_2000_2012.pdf?ua=1</a></p><h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Data for missing country-years are interpolated or extrapolated, according to the data available.
