			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The data principles of the World Health Organization (WHO) provide a foundation for continually reaffirming trust in WHO&amp;#x2019;s information and evidence on public health. The five principles are designed to provide a framework for data governance for WHO. The principles are intended primarily for use by WHO staff across all parts of the Organization in order to help define the values and standards that govern how data that flows into, across and out of WHO is collected, processed, shared and used. These principles are made publicly available so that they may be used and referred to by Member States and non-state actors collaborating with WHO.&lt;/p&gt;
