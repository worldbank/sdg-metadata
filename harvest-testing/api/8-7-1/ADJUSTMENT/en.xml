	<message>The ADJUSTMENT field for indicator 8-7-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;While the concept of child labour includes working in activities that are hazardous in nature, to ensure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;comparability of estimates over time and to minimize data quality issues, work beyond age-specific hourly thresholds are used as a proxy for hazardous work for the purpose of reporting on SDG indicator 8.7.1. Similarly, while the worst forms of child labour other than hazardous also form part of the concept of child labour more broadly, data on the worst forms of child labour are not currently captured in regular household surveys given difficulties with accurately and reliably measuring it. Therefore, this element of child labour is not captured by the indicators used for reporting on SDG 8.7.1. In addition, &amp;#x2018;own use production of goods&amp;#x2019;, including activities such as fetching water and collecting firewood,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;falls within the production boundary set by the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA). However, for the purpose of SDG reporting of indicator 8.7.1, and with the goal of facilitating international comparability, fetching water and collecting firewood have been classified as unpaid household services (i.e., household chores), a form of production that lies outside the SNA production boundary.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
