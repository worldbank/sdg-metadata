It sets international standards for labour statistics through the International Conference of Labour Statisticians. It also compiles and produces labour statistics with the goal of disseminating internationally comparable datasets, and provides technical assistance and training to ILO member States to support their efforts to produce high quality labour market data, including child labour data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNICEF provides technical and financial assistance to Member States to support their efforts to collect high quality data on child labour, including through UNICEF-supported MICS household survey programme. UNICEF also compiles child labour statistics with the goal of making internationally comparable datasets publicly available, and it analyzes child labour statistics, which are included in relevant data-driven publications, including in its flagship publication, &lt;em&gt;The State of the World&amp;#x2019;s Children&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
