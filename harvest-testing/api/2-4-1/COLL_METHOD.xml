			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;A questionnaire is sent to all countries annually since 2020 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators/241/en/&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators/241/en/&lt;/a&gt; ). Furthermore in order to facilitate data collection by countries, a data module has been designed, which contains the core set of questions necessary to obtain the data for SDG 2.4.1. If farm surveys already exist within a country, these questions can be integrated into existing instruments in order to minimize the burden to national statistical offices in data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All data collection activities will be done through the National Statistical Office or the office designated to collect data for this indicator. FAO, together with the Global Strategy to improve Agriculture and Rural Statistics (GSARS), have developed the capacity development material necessary for this indicator, including a methodological guide, an enumerator manual, calculation document and an e-learning course to train country NSO and other relevant staff on the indictor. &lt;/p&gt;
