	<message>The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 11-a-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data sources&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary source of data is the official documents of national urban policies and regional development plans, available in or provided by national and regional administrations of the countries. All these will be derived from the national and global state of NUP survey results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alignment of the policies and plans with proposed indicators are assessed by independent national level policy evaluators to avoid subjectivity and bias. The field of practice on NUP has developed a database of experts across the regions where evaluators are routinely drawn for undertaking these reviews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help with this evaluation according to the three qualifiers, policy evaluators follow an agreed upon analysis framework. Other supporting tools such as expert opinion, baseline data, benchmarking, performance monitoring and reporting, and gap and content analysis could be used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global, regional and national level compilations and analyses of NUP have already been undertaken by UN-Habitat and partners, which provide a solid foundation of evidence and expertise for the monitoring of indicator this proposed proxy indicator for 11.a.1. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
