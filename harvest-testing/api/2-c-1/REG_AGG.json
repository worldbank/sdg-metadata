This is because the commodities and food baskets monitored across countries are not sufficiently homogenous to aggregate into one price index. However, if a majority of countries within a region presents abnormally high prices, either for a particular commodity or the food price index, this region is qualified as a region suffering from high prices. </p>\n<p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>\n<p>FAO relies on the Food Price Indices as reported in FAOSTAT as well as on available official domestic food price data that it compiles in the Food Price Monitoring and Analysis (FPMA) tool to calculate the indicator. The FPMA database brings together price series for main food commodities (mainly cereal products) in selected markets in countries around the world. As a result, the indicator estimated by FAO can differ from the indicator estimated at country level, as it may be calculated on prices for a different market or commodity. </p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
