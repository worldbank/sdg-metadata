  &lt;li&gt;The indicator is calculated on food price data, which is gathered from official sources, same as for the food price index published in FAOSTAT. To ensure the correct calculation of the indicator, the process for the calculation of the indicator relies on an automated system. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On request, countries are supported by FAO to implement the indicator and interpret the results. In addition, training is provided in the country upon request. &lt;/li&gt;
