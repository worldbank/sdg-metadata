	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 3-7-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, there is no discrepancy between data presented and data published in survey reports. However, some published national data have been adjusted by the Population Division to improve comparability. Notes are used in the data set to indicate when adjustments were made and where data differed from standard definitions. The global indicator represents all women of reproductive age. Some survey estimates represent women who are married or in a union and this is indicated in a note.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
