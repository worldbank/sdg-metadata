	<data>&lt;p&gt;Differences in the survey design and implementation, as well as differences in the way survey questionnaires are formulated and administered can affect the comparability of the data. The most common differences relate to the range of contraceptive methods included and the characteristics (age, sex, marital or union status) of the persons for whom contraceptive prevalence is estimated (base population). The time frame used to assess contraceptive prevalence can also vary. In most surveys there is no definition of what is meant by &amp;#x201C;currently using&amp;#x201D; a method of contraception. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some surveys, the lack of probing questions, asked to ensure that the respondent understands the meaning of the different contraceptive methods, can result in an underestimation of contraceptive prevalence, in particular for traditional methods. Sampling variability can also be an issue, especially when contraceptive prevalence is measured for a specific subgroup (by age-group, level of educational attainment, place of residence, etc.) or when analysing trends over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When data on women aged 15 to 49 are not available, information for married or in-union women is reported. Illustrations of base populations that are sometimes presented are: married or in-union women aged 15-44, sexually active women (irrespective of marital status), or ever-married women. Notes in the data set indicate any differences between the data presented and the standard definitions of contraceptive prevalence or unmet need for family planning or where data pertain to populations that are not representative of women of reproductive age. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
