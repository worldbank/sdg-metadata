	<message>The IMPUTATION field for indicator 12-3-1b, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Missing values are not imputed for national figures. However, UNEP is using a global modelling approach for level 1 (this is due to the lack of data on this topic and the interest in having data that can be used for high-level tracking).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
