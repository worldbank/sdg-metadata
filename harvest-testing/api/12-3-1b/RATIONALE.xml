			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;According to an FAO publication in 2011, approximately one-third of all food is lost or wasted. This results in economic loss and increased pressure on food systems. Reducing food waste is critical to maximizing the value of agricultural land and ensuring that natural resources are used in a sustainable way. This indicator will not only help countries identify where food is lost and wasted but also it can provide information which Governments, citizens and the private sector can take in order to reduce food waste.&lt;/p&gt;
