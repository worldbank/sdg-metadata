	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 2-2-2b, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard analysis approach to construct the joint data set aims for a maximum comparability of country estimates. For the inclusion of survey estimates into the JME dataset, the inter-agency group applies survey quality assessment criteria. When there is insufficient documentation, the survey is not included until information becomes available. When raw data are available, and there is a question about the analysis approach, data re-analysis is performed following the standard methodology. Discrepancies between results from standardised approach and those reported may occur for various reasons, for example, the use of different standards for z-score calculations, imputation of the day of birth when missing, the use of rounded age in months, the use of different flagging systems for data exclusion. For surveys based on the previous NCHS/WHO references, and for which raw data are not available, a method for converting the z-scores to be based on the WHO Child Growth Standards is applied (Yang and de Onis, 2008). In addition, when surveys do not cover the age interval 0-&amp;lt;5 years, or are only representative of the rural areas, an adjustment based on other surveys for the same country, is performed. Any adjustment or conversion is transparently stated in the annotated joint data set.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
