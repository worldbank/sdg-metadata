&lt;p&gt;Exposure: Indicator 7.1.2 was used as exposure indicator for household air pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual mean concentration of particulate matter of less than 2.5 um was used as exposure indicator for ambient air pollution. The data is modelled according to methods described for Indicator 11.6.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposure-risk function: The integrated exposure-response functions (IER) developed for the GBD 2010 (Burnett et al, 2014) and further updated for the GBD 2013 study (Forouzanfar et al, 2015) were used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health data: The total number of deaths by disease, country, sex and age group have been developed by the World Health Organization (WHO 2014b).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
