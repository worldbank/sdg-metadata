	<data>&lt;p&gt;Rational environmental management means making the best use of resources to meet basic human needs without destroying the sustaining and regenerative capacity of natural systems. This requires a good understanding of the intersecting elements within the larger frame of development and implies the adoption and use of alternative, environmentally sound development strategies and related technologies. ESTs play an important role to improve efficiency of resources (materials and energy), reduce pollution and waste from different sectors. The importance of Environmentally Sound Technology was first emphasized during Rio Earth Summit in 1992 and ever since it has become a major component of international environmental cooperation. Access to ESTs also play a central role in the ground-breaking agreement, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda &amp;#x2013; which is an implementing mechanism for the global Sustainable Development Goals (2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development), the agreement was reached by the 193 UN Member States.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
