	<data>&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of possible sources of data on employees&amp;#x2019; earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establishment surveys are usually the most reliable source, given the high accuracy of earnings figures derived from them (the information typically comes from the payroll, so is precise). However, the scope of these statistics is limited to the coverage of the establishment survey in question (usually excluding small establishments, agricultural establishments and/or informal sector establishments).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Household surveys (and especially labour force surveys) can provide earnings statistics covering all economic activities, and all establishment types and sizes, but the quality of the data is highly dependent on the accuracy of respondents&amp;#x2019; answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on earnings could also be derived from a variety of administrative records.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
