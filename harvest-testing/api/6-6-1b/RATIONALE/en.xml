	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 6-6-1b, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rationale:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands is the Intergovernmental treaty that provides the framework for the Conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources. The Convention was adopted in 1971 and came into force in 1975. Since then 170 Countries, representing almost 90% on UN member states, from all the world&amp;#xB4;s geographic regions have acceded to become Contracting Parties under the Convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its 52nd meeting, in 2016, the Standing Committee of the Ramsar Convention agreed that Parties would include in their national reports for the 13th meeting of the Conference of the Parties, which have been submitted in January 2018, data on the &amp;#x201C;extent&amp;#x201D; of wetlands. This requirement provides an intergovernmental mechanism to obtain verified data that clearly contribute to Indicator 6.6.1 on wetland extent, but also to collect information for Target 15.1 which consider other types of ecosystems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator provides a measure of the relative extent of inland wetlands in a country. It follows the rationale of the forest indicator (Indicator 15.1.1). The availability of accurate data on a country&amp;apos;s wetland extent based on the country&amp;#xB4;s wetland inventory is crucial for the decision making regarding policies, restoration of critical wetlands or designation under national or international management or protected area categories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in the wetland extent reflect wetland loss and degradation for land use changes or for other uses and may help identify unsustainable practices from different sectors.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
