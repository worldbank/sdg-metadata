	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 14-1-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;This methodology mobilizes the collection of widely available earth observation data and other data sources which will be validated by countries. The methodologies used to generate this data are technical in nature. The methodology employs internationally recognized methods, from expert communities such as the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) and international space agencies and technical experts. There is a need to provide training on these indicators over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indicator is designed in a way to generate data to allow informed decision making towards identifying the state of pollution and pollution flows in oceans. It is assumed that countries would use the data to actively make decisions, but as oceans are transboundary, it makes this decision-making complex. Additionally, there is a need to consider data on pollution generation and waste in conjunction with these indicators.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
