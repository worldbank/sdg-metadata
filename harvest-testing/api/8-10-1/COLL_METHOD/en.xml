	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Collection process:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, the FAS Team reaches out to FAS respondents to initiate the annual survey process. Data are compiled by countries and sent to the IMF through the ICS which allows for a secure submission of country information. Data are processed and validated by the FAS Team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each submission is carefully reviewed, and when necessary, the FAS Team engages with the country authorities for clarifications or adjustments to the data provided. In case a country needs to add additional relevant information pertinent to the data reported, they can do so through the metadata portal in ICS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, submissions are disseminated on the FAS website (&lt;a href=&quot;https://data.imf.org/fas&quot;&gt;https://data.imf.org/fas&lt;/a&gt;) on a rolling basis as soon as they are reviewed and validated by the FAS Team.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
