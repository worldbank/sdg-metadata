	<data>&lt;p&gt;The FAS is a supply-side database based on administrative data from central banks or other main financial regulators. The data collection is centralized at the regulatory agency, which sources data from financial institutions and financial services providers for series for which data are available. The regulatory agency reports aggregates for the total economy to the FAS. The FAS provides country-level metadata that explain the institutional coverage of each reporting economy. Data from the FAS may differ from household-based surveys because of possible difference in coverage, scope, or concept definitions. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
