  &lt;li&gt;FAS data are collected through the Integrated Collection System (ICS) which allows for a secure submission of country information. Data submitted by countries are received internally in a system that facilitates the validation process conducted by the FAS Team. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each submission is carefully reviewed, and when necessary, the FAS Team engages with the country authorities for clarifications or adjustments to the data provided. In case a country needs to add additional relevant information pertinent to the data reported, they can do so through the metadata portal in ICS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</data>
