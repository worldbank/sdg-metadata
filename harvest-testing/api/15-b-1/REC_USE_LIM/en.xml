	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 15-b-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Comments and limitations:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A) OECD CRS data are available since 1973. However, the data coverage at an activity level is considered complete from 1995 for commitments and 2002 for disbursements. The Rio biodiversity marker was introduced in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B) The OECD PINE database tracks the biodiversity-relevant economic instruments that countries have put in place, and countries are encouraged to also provide information on the revenue and finance channelled via each of the instruments. The comprehensiveness of data provided currently varies across the biodiversity-relevant economic instruments. The data on revenue generated by biodiversity-relevant taxes is currently the most comprehensive. For the data on biodiversity-relevant fees and charges, for example, of the total number of these instruments currently reported to the PINE database, 42% also include data on the finance they generate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all data provided by a diffuse set of respondents, the data is subject to missing values, human error, and differences in interpretation of the provided definitions. However, all possible efforts have been made to ensure that the data is complete, accurate, and comparable across countries.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
