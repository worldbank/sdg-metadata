			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Data for the indicator will follow the quality assurance measures put in place by IPU for Parline data. Data is collected directly from national parliaments. Quality controls and &amp;#x201C;sanity checks&amp;#x201D; are carried out by the IPU, using comparison against historical records for the same country and comparison between countries. In the case of any inconsistencies, a dialogue is opened with the parliament to clarify and, where necessary, correct the data. In addition, parliaments are invited to review all of their data on New Parline at regular intervals, at least annually and following elections.&lt;/p&gt;
