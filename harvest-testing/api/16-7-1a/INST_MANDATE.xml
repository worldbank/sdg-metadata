			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The IPU is a global organization of national parliaments founded in 1889 that promotes democracy and sustainable development and helps parliaments to become stronger, younger, gender-balanced and more diverse. The IPU has a historical record of collecting reference data on parliaments since the 1960s. It also maintains the flaghsip Parline database on national parliaments -- an authoratative and up-to-date resource containing over 600 data fields for every functioning parliament in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017 UNDP approached the IPU to jointly develop metadata for the 16.7.1a component of this indicator and in November 2018 the UN-IAEG approved the metadata and confirmed IPU as custodian.&lt;/p&gt;
