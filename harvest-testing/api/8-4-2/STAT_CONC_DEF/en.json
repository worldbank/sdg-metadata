{"status":"success","message":"The STAT_CONC_DEF field for indicator 8-4-2, translated into en","data":"<h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>\n<h2>Definition:</h2>\n<p>Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a standard material flow accounting (MFA) indicator and reports the apparent consumption of materials in a national economy. </p>\n<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n<p>Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) and MF need to be looked at in combination as they cover the two aspects of the economy, production and consumption. The DMC reports the actual amount of material in an economy, MF the virtual amount required across the whole supply chain to service final demand. A country can, for instance have a very high DMC because it has a large primary production sector for export or a very low DMC because it has outsourced most of the material intensive industrial process to other countries. The material footprint corrects for both phenomena. </p>"}
