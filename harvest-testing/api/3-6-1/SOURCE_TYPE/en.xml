&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the road traffic deaths we have two sources of data. Data from Global Status Report on Road Safety survey and Vital registration or certificate deaths data that WHO receive every year from member states (ministries of health).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the population, we used data from the United Nations / Department of Economic and Social Affairs/ Population division.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
