	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Comments and limitations:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no vital registration data for all countries to make comparison against the data received on the survey. We published only confidence intervals for countries that have poor completeness of vital registration data. Also we cannot collect road traffic data every year using this methodology outlined in the Global status report.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
