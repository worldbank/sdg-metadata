It includes activities that are normally integrated into the process of production and occur at sea, such as fishing vessels which process or preserve their catch on board. However, it does not include the processing or preserving of fish when it occurs in land based facilities.</p>\n<p>A <u>fish stock</u> is a subset of a species (fish, crustacean, mollusc, etc.) or a population inhabiting a geographical area and participating in the same reproductive process.</p>\n<p><u>Maximum sustainable yield (MSY)</u> is the highest theoretical equilibrium yield that can be continuously taken (on average) from a stock under existing (average) environmental conditions without significantly affecting the reproduction process. A stock fished at <u>(MSY)</u> is referred to as <u>biologically sustainable</u>, as it may remain stable or grow while sustaining losses from fishing and natural sources of mortality.</p>\n<p><u>FAO Fishing Areas for Statistical Purposes</u> are arbitrary areas to facilitate comparison of data, improving the possibilities of cooperation in statistical matters.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[1]</a></sup></p>\n<p>The basic concepts associated with this indicator are part of the following international instruments and classification schemes:</p>\n<p><u>The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)</u><sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[2]</a></sup></p>\n<p><em>This instrument is the basis upon which all the subsequent instruments are built.

This data is obtained from UNSD and OECD databases, both available online. </p>\n<p>Stock status:</p>\n<p>The fish stocks that FAO has monitored since 1974 represent a wide spectrum of data availability, ranging from data-rich and formally assessed stocks to those that have very little information apart from catch statistics by FAO major fishing area and those with no stock assessment at all. For the purposes of using the best available data and information and maintaining consistency among stocks and assessors, a procedure has been defined to identify stock status information (FAO 2011).</p>\n<p>FAO collects national data through a questionnaire sent to the Principal Focal Point (PFP) of each country. The PFP organises an institutional set-up which identifies the competent authorities to develop a reference list of stocks and completes the questionnaire. The information or data collected through the questionnaire from a country will initially only inform individual country progress. Depending on the evolution and further standardization of country reporting over the next 3-5 years, national data may be used to inform global/regional estimates. </p><p>Data for GDP and value added is retrieved by FAO from UNSD (or the OECD in case of missing values) once a year every February.</p>\n<p>FAO compiles stock status information biennially.</p><p>New data for this indicator is expected to be released biennially in March.</p><p>National governmental agencies reporting to:</p>\n<p>&#x2022; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).</p>\n<p>&#x2022; United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD). </p>\n<p>&#x2022; The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</p><p>Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.</p><p>FAO is the sole custodian of indicator 14.7.1, as designated by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goal Indicators (IAEG-SDGs).</p><p>Although target 14.7 promotes the sustainable use of marine resources &#x201C;including of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism&#x201D;, this indicator as selected by the IAEG-SDG focuses only on the sustainable use of marine resources by fisheries. The methodology hereby proposed by FAO thus measures sustainable fisheries as a percentage of GDP, in accordance to the agreed indicator formulation.</p>\n<p>The share of value added from an industry in GDP is commonly used as an indication of its economic importance. Accordingly, the value added of marine capture fisheries indicates the prominence of marine fish related activities in the country&#x2019;s economy and its importance for livelihoods. Both GDP and the VA are measured in constant prices and domestic currency.</p>\n<p>Stocks that are fished at sustainable levels are able to support the communities and industries which rely on them, without compromising reproduction and long-term sustainability. By contrast, a stock that is exploited to a point where it cannot replenish itself will ultimately provide sub-optimal long-term economic returns for stakeholders. </p>\n<p>The status of a fish stock is evaluated through a various processes of assessment that commonly combines biological and statistical information to assess changes in its abundance in response to fishing, which also enables forecasting of future trends. </p>\n<p>FAO has been periodically analysing and compiling the status of marine fish stocks combining the results of formal stock assessments available, including the assessments carried out at the regional level and a finer scale by national institutions and scientific working groups. For stocks that do not have a formal stock assessment, effort is made to collect relevant data and information from the literature, or from local experts, that could be used to infer stock status (for instance trends in catch rates, size frequency distribution of the catch, occasional fishing mortality estimates through surveys, etc.). The information from various sources is analysed and synthesized to classify the exploitation status of fish stocks. FAO monitoring of stocks will be enhanced with the implementation of SDG indicator 14.4.1, which tracks progress towards more fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels at national, regional (across FAO Major Fishing Areas) and global levels.</p>\n<p>Based on FAO&#x2019;s monitoring of stocks at regional and global level, the percentage of fish resources that are within biologically sustainable levels has exhibited a downward trend from 90 percent in 1974 to 67 percent in 2015, while 33 percent are considered to be overexploited. Overexploitation not only has negative ecological consequences, but also reduces long-term fishery yields, which have adverse social and economic effects, particularly for dependent communities in developing countries and Small Island Developing States (SIDS).</p><p>The indicator measures the value added of sustainable marine capture fisheries as a proportion of GDP. However, the vast majority of countries report only aggregated data for value added for the fisheries and aquaculture sector. To overcome this problem it is necessary to separate the value added for marine capture fisheries from the aggregated data. Preferably this would be done using the value of marine capture fisheries as a proxy. However, in the absence of value data, the quantity of marine capture fisheries as a proportion of total production is used as a proxy for the proportion of value added.</p>\n<p>For marine capture fisheries, despite the expanded coverage of FAO&#x2019;s assessments in recent years, data deficiencies may lead to uncertainty as to the level of exploitation of a stock. While data limitations exist, the methodology employed by FAO seeks to eliminate discrepancies and provide a representative assessment of marine fish stocks. The time series for which stock assessment is available starts with the first public release of FAO stock assessment, in 2011 for each FAO Major Fishing area. FAO continues to release this information biennially.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-9\" id=\"footnote-ref-9\">[8]</a></sup></p>\n<p>National fish stock assessments are only available for a few countries, and therefore are not globally or regionally representative. Therefore, the sustainability multiplier used in the compilation of this indicator is based on the average fish stock sustainability calculated by FAO for each Major Fishing Area. For each country, the sustainability multiplier will be the average sustainability weighted by the proportion of the quantity of marine capture for each respective fishing area in which the country performs fishing activities. </p>\n<p>Currently, FAO aims to begin compiling country-level estimates for SDG indicator 14.4.1 (proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels) in 2020. Once these estimates become available, the computation method for the current indicator will use country-level estimates rather than estimates based on FAO Major Fishing Areas to determine the sustainability multiplier and hence estimate the value added of sustainable marine capture fisheries as a proportion of GDP. </p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-9\">8</sup><p> The most recent version of Review of the State of World Marine Fishery Resources which contains stock status is available at <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf</a> <a href=\"#footnote-ref-9\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div><p>The method of computation for 14.7.1 differs depending on the availability of data.

National statistical systems are the primary providers of data for each aspect of the indicator. Value added and GDP data are collected and validated by the countries themselves. All inputs are reviewed for consistency prior to calculation of the indicator to ensure the consistency of figures and methodologies</p><p>National accounts data is harmonised to ensure that figures for GDP and the value added of fisheries and aquaculture are obtained from the same ISIC review and System of National Accounts (SNA) series.</p><ul>\n  <li>At country level</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This indicator examines economic contribution from marine capture fisheries. If a country has no marine capture fisheries then the indicator is not calculated for that country.</p>\n<p>No imputation is performed to derive estimates for countries or years when the value added of fisheries and aquaculture is not available. </p>\n<p>FAO employs a wide spectrum of data and analysis to assess 500 fish stocks, which accounts for 70&#x2013;80 percent of global landings. A detailed description of the approach used by FAO is available at the Review of the State of World Marine Fishery Resources.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-10\" id=\"footnote-ref-10\">[9]</a></sup> If national estimates of fish stocks are not available from SDG 14.4.1 , then regional stock status will be used.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>At regional and global level</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not applicable. Regional aggregates will only be calculated based on contribution of sustainable fisheries to the GDP of those countries that have reported value added for fishing and aquaculture in a given year. </p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-10\">9</sup><p> The most recent version of Review of the State of World Marine Fishery Resources is available at <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf</a> <a href=\"#footnote-ref-10\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div><p>Regional and global aggregates will be generated by taking the average value of the indicator for countries in each SDG region.</p>\n<p>When interpreting regional aggregates, it is important to consider that a country&#x2019;s geographic region is not necessarily indicative of how or where it fishes. Countries may fish in completely different fishing areas from others in their region, and therefore land-based regional aggregates can be inappropriate when dealing with marine resources.</p><p>All data used in the calculation of this indicator is drawn from already available international sources. As such there is no additional reporting burden for countries.</p><p>N/A</p><p>In order to provide continuity of collection of data for value added for fisheries and aquaculture, and GDP across different versions of the Systems of National Accounts (SNA) and ISIC revisions, FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Department ensures its consistency by the use of backwards and forwards linkages when collecting and validating the information.</p>\n<p>While SDG indicator 14.7.1 is completely constructed on data already provided by countries to FAO, to the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) and to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), countries are invited to collaborate with FAO to increase the precision of their results, by providing otherwise unavailable inputs for the calculation of the indicator.</p><p>The indicator provides a clear framework for monitoring countries&#x2019; progress towards target 14.7. Inputs are robust, standardised, globally recognised and available for a wide range of countries, including many developing nations. As such there is comprehensive coverage for the majority of countries.</p>\n<p>There may be variation in the completeness of nationally reported data. Improvements in data collection by national statistics systems may improve the accuracy of this indicator. When regional stock status is used in the calculation of this indicator it may not fully reflect the sustainability of national fisheries.</p><p>Data availability:</p>\n<p>The indicator may be calculated based on currently available data for 128 countries which have marine capture fisheries and have reported the value added of fisheries and aquaculture at least once since 2011. This includes 35 SIDS, 68 developing countries and 23 least developed countries.</p>\n<p>Breakdown of country data availability by region, starting in 2011:</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n

Sin embargo, no incluye la elaboración o conservación de pescado cuando se produce en instalaciones terrestres. </p>\n<p> Una <u> población de peces </u> es un subconjunto de una especie (peces, crustáceos, moluscos, etc.) o una población que habita una zona geográfica y participa en el mismo proceso de reproducción. </p>\n<p> <u> Rendimiento máximo sostenible (RMS) </u> es el rendimiento de equilibrio teórico más alto que puede obtenerse continuamente (en promedio) de una población en condiciones ambientales (promedio) existentes sin afectar significativamente el proceso de reproducción.

Cuando los datos notificados por los países para el indicador 14.4.1 de los ODS (&#x201C;proporción de las poblaciones de peces dentro de los niveles biológicamente sostenibles&#x201D;) estén disponibles, se utilizarán para sustituir el actual multiplicador de sostenibilidad del indicador 14.7.1 de los ODS. </p><h2> Publicación de datos: </h2>\n<p> Se espera que los nuevos datos para este indicador se publiquen cada dos años en marzo. </p><h1> Proveedores de datos</h1>\n<p> Agencias gubernamentales nacionales que reportan a:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Agricultura y la Alimentación (FAO). </li>\n  <li> División de Estadística de las Naciones Unidas. </li>\n  <li> La Organización de Cooperación y Desarrollo Económicos (OCDE). </li>\n</ul><h1> Compiladores de datos</h1>\n<p> Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Agricultura y la Alimentación. </p><h2>Justificación:</h2>\n<p>Aunque la meta 14.7 promueve el uso sostenible de los recursos marinos &#x201C; incluidos los de la pesca, la acuicultura y el turismo&#x201D;, este indicador, tal como fue seleccionado por el IAEG-ODS, se centra únicamente en el uso sostenible de los recursos marinos por parte de la pesca. Así pues, la metodología propuesta por la FAO mide la pesca sostenible como porcentaje del PIB, de conformidad con la formulación de indicadores acordada. </p>\n<p> La participación del valor agregado de una industria en el PIB se utiliza comúnmente como indicación de su importancia económica. En consecuencia, el valor agregado de la pesca de captura marina indica la prominencia de las actividades relacionadas con la pesca marina en la economía del país y su importancia para los medios de vida. Tanto el PIB como el VA se miden en precios constantes y en moneda nacional. </p>\n<p> Las poblaciones que se pescan a niveles sostenibles pueden apoyar a las comunidades e industrias que dependen de ellas, sin comprometer la reproducción y la sostenibilidad a largo plazo. Por el contrario, una población que se explota hasta un punto en el que no puede reponerse por sí misma proporcionará en última instancia rendimientos económicos a largo plazo subóptimos para las partes interesadas. </p>\n<p> El estado de una población de peces se evalúa a través de varios procesos de evaluación que comúnmente combinan información biológica y estadística para evaluar los cambios en su abundancia en respuesta a la pesca, lo que también permite predecir las tendencias futuras. </p>\n<p> La FAO ha estado analizando y compilando periódicamente la situación de las poblaciones de peces marinos combinando los resultados de las evaluaciones oficiales de las poblaciones disponibles, incluidas las evaluaciones realizadas a nivel regional y una escala más fina por las instituciones nacionales y los grupos de trabajo científicos. En el caso de las poblaciones que no tienen una evaluación oficial de las poblaciones, se hace un esfuerzo por recopilar datos e información pertinentes de la bibliografía, o de expertos locales, que podrían utilizarse para inferir el estado de las poblaciones (por ejemplo, las tendencias en las tasas de captura, la distribución de la frecuencia del tamaño de las capturas, las estimaciones ocasionales de la mortalidad por pesca mediante encuestas, etc.). La información procedente de diversas fuentes se analiza y sintetiza para clasificar el estado de explotación de las poblaciones de peces. El seguimiento de las poblaciones de peces por parte de la FAO se mejorará con la aplicación del indicador 14.4.1 de los ODS, que hace un seguimiento del progreso hacia un mayor aumento de las poblaciones de peces dentro de niveles biológicamente sostenibles a nivel nacional, regional (en las principales zonas de pesca de la FAO) y mundial. </p>\n<p>Sobre la base del monitoreo de las poblaciones de la FAO a nivel regional y mundial, el porcentaje de recursos pesqueros que se encuentran dentro de niveles biológicamente sostenibles ha mostrado una tendencia a la baja del 90 por ciento en 1974 al 67 por ciento en 2015, mientras que el 33 por ciento se considera sobreexplotado. La sobreexplotación no sólo tiene consecuencias ecológicas negativas, sino que también reduce los rendimientos de la pesca a largo plazo, que tienen efectos sociales y económicos adversos, en particular para las comunidades dependientes de los países en desarrollo y los pequeños Estados insulares en desarrollo. </p><h2> Comentarios y limitaciones:</h2>\n<p> El indicador mide el valor agregado de la pesca de captura marina sostenible como proporción del PIB. Sin embargo, la gran mayoría de los países sólo reportan datos agregados de valor agregado para el sector de la pesca y la acuicultura. Para superar este problema es necesario separar el valor agregado para la pesca de captura marina de los datos agregados. Preferiblemente, esto se haría utilizando el valor de la pesca de captura marina como sustituto. Sin embargo, a falta de datos sobre el valor, la cantidad de pesca de captura marina como proporción de la producción total se utiliza como indicador de la proporción de valor agregado. </p>\n<p> En el ámbito de la pesca de captura marina, a pesar de la ampliación de la cobertura de las evaluaciones de la FAO en los últimos años, las deficiencias de los datos pueden dar lugar a incertidumbre en cuanto al nivel de explotación de una población. Si bien existen limitaciones de datos, la metodología empleada por la FAO trata de eliminar las discrepancias y proporcionar una evaluación representativa de las poblaciones de peces marinos. La serie temporal para la que se dispone de una evaluación de las poblaciones comienza con la primera publicación de la evaluación de las poblaciones de la FAO, en 2011, para cada zona de pesca importante de la FAO. La FAO sigue divulgando esta información cada dos años. <sup><a href=\"#footnote-8\" id=\"footnote-ref-8\"> [8] </a></sup></p>\n<p> Las evaluaciones nacionales de las poblaciones de peces sólo están disponibles para unos pocos países y, por lo tanto, no son representativas a nivel mundial o regional. Por lo tanto, el multiplicador de sostenibilidad utilizado en la compilación de este indicador se basa en la sostenibilidad media de las poblaciones de peces calculada por la FAO para cada zona de pesca importante. Para cada país, el multiplicador de sostenibilidad será la sostenibilidad promedio ponderada por la proporción de la cantidad de captura marina para cada zona de pesca respectiva en la que el país realiza actividades pesqueras. </p>\n<p> Actualmente, la FAO tiene como objetivo comenzar a compilar estimaciones a nivel de país para el indicador 14.4.1 de los ODS (proporción de poblaciones de peces dentro de niveles biológicamente sostenibles) en 2020. Una vez que estas estimaciones estén disponibles, el método de cálculo para el indicador actual utilizará estimaciones a nivel de país en lugar de estimaciones basadas en las principales zonas de pesca de la FAO para determinar el multiplicador de sostenibilidad y, por lo tanto, estimar el valor agregado de la pesca de captura marina sostenible como proporción del PIB. </p><div class=\"footnotes\"> <div> <sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-8\">8</sup><p> La versión más reciente de Examen del estado de los recursos pesqueros marinos mundiales que contiene el estado de las poblaciones está disponible en <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf</a> <a href=\"#footnote-ref-8\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div><h1>Metodología</h1>\n<p>A nivel de país, la contribución de la pesca de captura marina sostenible al PIB se calcula de la siguiente manera:</p>\n<p>a) La contribución porcentual de la pesca y la acuicultura al PIB se estima simplemente dividiendo el valor agregado de la pesca y la acuicultura por el PIB nacional.</p>\n<p><em>PIB de la pesca y la acuicultura (%) = valor agregado de la pesca y la acuicultura/PIB</em></p>\n<p><em>PIB<sub>PA</sub> = VA<sub>PA</sub>/PIB</em></p>\n<p>b) A fin de desglosar por el valor agregado de la pesca de captura marina y el valor agregado de la acuicultura, la cantidad de pescado producido a partir de la pesca de captura marina se dividirá por la cantidad total de producción nacional de pescado, y luego se multiplicará por el porcentaje del PIB de la pesca y la acuicultura.

Los países pueden pescar en zonas de pesca completamente diferentes de otras de su región y, por lo tanto, los agregados regionales terrestres pueden ser inadecuados cuando se trata de recursos marinos. </p><h2> Garantía de calidad:</h2>\n<p> Con el fin de proporcionar continuidad a la recopilación de datos sobre el valor agregado para la pesca y la acuicultura, y el PIB en las diferentes versiones de los Sistemas de Cuentas Nacionales (SCN) y las revisiones de la CIIU, el Departamento de Pesca y Acuicultura de la FAO garantiza su coherencia mediante el uso de vínculos hacia atrás y hacia adelante al recopilar y validar la información. </p>\n<p> Si bien el indicador 14.7.1 de los ODS se basa completamente en datos ya proporcionados por los países a la FAO, a la División de Estadística de las Naciones Unidas y a la Organización de Cooperación y Desarrollo Económicos (OCDE), se invita a los países a colaborar con la FAO para aumentar la precisión de sus resultados, proporcionando insumos que de otro modo no estarían disponibles para el cálculo del indicador. </p><h1> Disponibilidad de los datos</h1>\n<h2> Descripción:</h2>\n<p> El indicador puede calcularse sobre la base de los datos actualmente disponibles para 128 países que tienen pesquerías de captura marina y que han notificado el valor añadido de la pesca y la acuicultura al menos una vez desde 2011. Esto incluye a 35 pequeños Estados insulares en desarrollo, 68 países en desarrollo y 23 países menos adelantados. </p>\n<p> Desglose de la disponibilidad de datos de países por región, a partir de

Lorsque les données communiquées par les pays pour l'indicateur 14.4.1 de l'ODD (&#x201C;proportion de stocks de poissons se situant dans des limites biologiquement viables&#x201D;) seront disponibles, elles seront utilisées pour remplacer le multiplicateur de viabilité actuel pour l'indicateur 14.7.1 de l'ODD.</p><h2>Publication des données :</h2>\n<p>Les nouvelles données pour cet indicateur devraient être publiées tous les deux ans en mars.</p><h1>Fournisseurs de données </h1>\n<p>Agences gouvernementales nationales relevant de :</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Organisation des Nations Unies pour l'alimentation et l'agriculture (FAO).</li>\n  <li>Division de la statistique des Nations Unies (UNSD). </li>\n  <li>L'Organisation de coopération et de développement économiques (OCDE).</li>\n</ul><h1>Compilateurs de données </h1>\n<p>Organisation des Nations Unies pour l'alimentation et l'agriculture.</p><h2>Justification : </h2>\n<p>Bien que la cible 14.7 encourage l'utilisation durable des ressources marines &#x201C;y compris de la pêche, de l'aquaculture et du tourisme &#x201D;, cet indicateur, tel qu'il a été sélectionné par le GIAE-GSS, se concentre uniquement sur l'utilisation durable des ressources marines par la pêche. La méthodologie proposée ici par la FAO mesure donc la pêche durable en pourcentage du PIB, conformément à la formulation convenue de l'indicateur.</p>\n<p>La part de la valeur ajoutée d'une industrie dans le PIB est généralement utilisée comme une indication de son importance économique. En conséquence, la valeur ajoutée des pêches de capture marines indique la prédominance des activités liées aux poissons marins dans l'économie du pays et son importance pour les moyens de subsistance. Le PIB et la VA sont tous deux mesurés en prix constants et en monnaie nationale.</p>\n<p>Les stocks qui sont pêchés à des niveaux durables sont capables de soutenir les communautés et les industries qui en dépendent, sans compromettre la reproduction et la durabilité à long terme. En revanche, un stock qui est exploité à un point tel qu'il ne peut pas se reconstituer fournira en fin de compte des rendements économiques à long terme sous-optimaux pour les parties prenantes. </p>\n<p>L'état d'un stock de poissons est évalué par divers processus d'évaluation qui combinent généralement des informations biologiques et statistiques pour évaluer les changements dans son abondance en réponse à la pêche, ce qui permet également de prévoir les tendances futures. </p>\n<p>La FAO analyse et compile périodiquement l'état des stocks de poissons marins en combinant les résultats des évaluations officielles disponibles, y compris les évaluations effectuées au niveau régional et à une échelle plus fine par des institutions nationales et des groupes de travail scientifiques. Pour les stocks qui n'ont pas fait l'objet d'une évaluation formelle, on s'efforce de collecter des données et des informations pertinentes dans la littérature ou auprès d'experts locaux, qui pourraient être utilisées pour déduire l'état du stock (par exemple, les tendances des taux de capture, la distribution de la fréquence des tailles de la capture, les estimations occasionnelles de la mortalité par pêche grâce aux enquêtes, etc.) Les informations provenant de diverses sources sont analysées et synthétisées pour classer l'état d'exploitation des stocks de poissons. Le suivi des stocks par la FAO sera renforcé par la mise en œuvre de l'indicateur 14.4.1 de l'ODD, qui permet de suivre les progrès accomplis pour accroître les stocks de poissons à des niveaux biologiquement viables aux niveaux national, régional (dans les principales zones de pêche de la FAO) et mondial</p>.\n<p>D'après le suivi des stocks de la FAO aux niveaux régional et mondial, le pourcentage des ressources halieutiques qui se situent dans des niveaux biologiquement durables a connu une tendance à la baisse, passant de 90 pour cent en 1974 à 67 pour cent en 2015, tandis que 33 pour cent sont considérés comme surexploités. La surexploitation a non seulement des conséquences écologiques négatives, mais elle réduit également les rendements halieutiques à long terme, ce qui a des effets sociaux et économiques néfastes, notamment pour les communautés dépendantes des pays en développement et des petits États insulaires en développement (PEID).</p><h2>Commentaires et limites :</h2>\n<p>L'indicateur mesure la valeur ajoutée des pêches de capture marines durables en tant que proportion du PIB. Cependant, la grande majorité des pays ne communiquent que des données agrégées sur la valeur ajoutée du secteur de la pêche et de l'aquaculture. Pour surmonter ce problème, il est nécessaire de séparer la valeur ajoutée des pêches de capture marines des données agrégées. Il serait préférable de le faire en utilisant la valeur des pêches de capture marines comme approximation. Toutefois, en l'absence de données sur la valeur, la quantité de pêches de capture marine par rapport à la production totale est utilisée comme approximation de la proportion de valeur ajoutée.</p>\n<p>Pour les pêches de capture marines, malgré la couverture élargie des évaluations de la FAO ces dernières années, les insuffisances des données peuvent conduire à une incertitude quant au niveau d'exploitation d'un stock. Bien que les données soient limitées, la méthodologie employée par la FAO cherche à éliminer les divergences et à fournir une évaluation représentative des stocks de poissons marins. La série chronologique pour laquelle l'évaluation des stocks est disponible commence avec la première publication de l'évaluation des stocks de la FAO, en 2011, pour chaque zone de pêche majeure de la FAO. La FAO continue de publier ces informations tous les deux ans.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-8\" id=\"footnote-ref-8\">[8]</a></sup></p>\n<p> Les évaluations nationales des stocks de poissons ne sont disponibles que pour quelques pays, et ne sont donc pas représentatives au niveau mondial ou régional. Par conséquent, le multiplicateur de durabilité utilisé dans la compilation de cet indicateur est basé sur la durabilité moyenne des stocks de poissons calculée par la FAO pour chaque zone de pêche majeure. Pour chaque pays, le multiplicateur de durabilité sera la durabilité moyenne pondérée par la proportion de la quantité de capture marine pour chaque zone de pêche respective dans laquelle le pays exerce des activités de pêche. </p>\n<p> Actuellement, la FAO vise à commencer à compiler les estimations au niveau des pays pour l'indicateur ODD 14.4.1 (proportion des stocks de poissons dans des niveaux biologiquement durables) en 2020. Une fois que ces estimations seront disponibles, la méthode de calcul de l'indicateur actuel utilisera les estimations au niveau national plutôt que les estimations basées sur les principales zones de pêche de la FAO pour déterminer le multiplicateur de durabilité et donc estimer la valeur ajoutée des pêches de capture marines durables en tant que proportion du PIB. </p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-8\">8</sup><p> La version la plus récente de l'Examen de l'état des ressources halieutiques marines mondiales, qui contient l'état des stocks, est disponible à l'adresse suivante : <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf </a> <a href=\"#footnote-ref-8\"> &#x2191; </a> </p> </div> </div><h1>Méthodologie</h1>\n<p>A l'échelle d'un pays, la contribution des pêches de capture marines durables au PIB est calculée comme suit :</p>\n<p>a) La contribution en pourcentage de la pêche et de l'aquaculture au PIB est estimée en divisant simplement la valeur ajoutée de la pêche et de l'aquaculture par le PIB national.</p>\n<p><em>PIB de la pêche et de l'aquaculture (%) = Valeur ajoutée de la pêche et de l'aquaculture/PIB</em></p>\n<p><em>PIB<sub>FIA</sub> = VA<sub>FIA</sub>/GDP</em></p>\n<p>b) Afin de désagréger pour la valeur ajoutée des pêches de capture marines et la valeur ajoutée de l'aquaculture, la quantité de poisson produite par les pêches de capture marines sera divisée par la quantité totale de la production nationale de poisson, puis multipliée par le pourcentage du PIB provenant de la pêche et de l'aquaculture.

Когда станут доступны данные, представленные странами по показателю 14.4.1 ЦУР (&#x201C; Доля рыбных запасов, находящихся в биологически устойчивых пределах &#x201D;), они будут использоваться вместо нынешнего коэффициент рационального использования для показателя 14.7.1 ЦУР. </p><h2> Выпуск данных: </h2>\n<p> Ожидается, что новые данные по этому показателю будут публиковаться раз в два года в марте. </p><h1> Поставщики данных </h1>\n<p> Национальные правительственные агентства, представляющие отчеты в адрес: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Продовольственной и сельскохозяйственной организации ООН (ФАО). </li>\n  <li> Статистического отдела Организации Объединенных Наций (СОООН). </li>\n  <li> Организации экономического сотрудничества и развития (ОЭСР). </li>\n</ul><h1> Составители данных </h1>\n<p> Продовольственная и сельскохозяйственная организация ООН. </p><h2> Обоснование: </h2>\n<p> Хотя задача 14.7 способствует устойчивому использованию морских ресурсов &#x201C;, включая рыболовство, аквакультуру и туризм &#x201D;, этот показатель, отобранный МГЭ-ЦУР, фокусируется только на устойчивом использовании морских ресурсов в сфере рыболовства. Таким образом, предложенная ФАО методология оценивает устойчивое рыболовство в процентах от ВВП в соответствии с согласованной формулировкой показателя. </p>\n<p> Доля добавленной стоимости отрасли в ВВП обычно используется как показатель ее экономической значимости. Соответственно, добавленная стоимость морского рыболовства указывает на важность видов деятельности, связанных с морской рыбой, в экономике страны и их важность для жизнеобеспечения. И ВВП, и добавленная стоимость отражаются в постоянных ценах и в национальной валюте. </p>\n<p> Запасы, которые вылавливаются на устойчивом уровне, могут поддерживать сообщества и отрасли, которые от них зависят, без ущерба для воспроизводства и долгосрочной устойчивости. Напротив, запасы, которые эксплуатируются до такой степени, что они не могут пополняться, в конечном итоге не обеспечат достаточную долгосрочную экономическую выручку для заинтересованных сторон. </p>\n<p>Состояние рыбных запасов оценивается с помощью различных процессов оценки, которые обычно объединяют биологическую и статистическую информацию для оценки изменений в их численности как реакцию на промысловую деятельность, что также позволяет прогнозировать будущие тенденции. </p>\n<p> ФАО периодически анализирует и формирует состояние морских рыбных запасов, объединяя результаты имеющихся официальных оценок запасов, включая оценки, проводимые на региональном уровне и в более мелком масштабе национальными учреждениями и научными рабочими группами. Для запасов, по которым нет официальной оценки запаса, предпринимаются усилия по сбору соответствующих данных и информации из литературных источников или от местных экспертов, которые могут быть использованы для подготовки заключения о состоянии запаса (например, тенденции в интенсивности рыболовства, частотное распределение размеров вылова, оценки случайной промысловой смертности, получаемые с помощью обследований и т. д.). Информация из различных источников анализируется и объединяется для систематизации эксплуатационного статуса рыбных запасов. Мониторинг запасов ФАО будет усилен с внедрением показателя 14.4.1 ЦУР, по которому надлежит отслеживать прогресс в направлении увеличения рыбных запасов в биологически устойчивых состояниях на национальном, региональном (по важным районам рыбного промысла ФАО) и глобальном уровнях. </p>\n<p> По данным мониторинга запасов ФАО на региональном и глобальном уровнях, доля рыбных ресурсов, находящихся в пределах биологически устойчивых уровней, показала тенденцию к снижению с 90 процентов в 1974 году до 67 процентов в 2015 году, вместе с тем 33 процента рыбных ресурсов считаются чрезмерно эксплуатируемыми. Чрезмерная эксплуатация не только имеет негативные экологические последствия, но и снижает рыбные уловы в долгосрочной перспективе, что имеет неблагоприятные социальные и экономические последствия, особенно для общин, зависящих от рыболовства в развивающихся странах и малых островных развивающихся государствах (МОРАГ).</p><h2> Комментарии и ограничения: </h2>\n<p>Показатель отражает добавленную стоимость устойчивого морского рыболовства как долю в ВВП. Однако подавляющее большинство стран предоставляют только агрегированные данные по добавленной стоимости сектора рыболовства и аквакультуры. Чтобы решить эту проблему, необходимо выделить добавленную стоимость морского рыболовства из агрегированных данных. Желательно, чтобы это было сделано с использованием величины морского рыболовства в качестве косвенного показателя. В условиях отсутствия стоимостных данных, количество выловленной морской рыбы, как доли в общем объеме производства, используется в качестве косвенного показателя доли добавленной стоимости.</p>\n<p> В отношении морского рыболовства, несмотря на более широкий охват в последние годы оценок ФАО, недостаток в данных может привести к неопределенности в отношении уровня эксплуатации запаса. Несмотря на существующую ограниченность данных, применяемая ФАО методология старается устранить расхождения и обеспечить репрезентативную оценку запасов морских рыб. Временные ряды, в которых имеется оценка запасов, начинаются с первой публикации в 2011 году в открытом доступе оценки запасов, сделанной ФАО для каждого важного района рыбного промысла. ФАО продолжает публиковать эту информацию раз в два года. <sup> <a href=\"#footnote-8\" id=\"footnote-ref-8\"> [8] </a> </sup> </p>\n<p>Национальные оценки рыбных запасов доступны только для нескольких стран и поэтому не являются репрезентативными на глобальном или региональном уровне. Следовательно, коэффициент рационального использования, применяемый при составлении этого показателя, основан на среднем значении рационального использования рыбных запасов, рассчитываемого ФАО для каждого важного района рыбного промысла. Для каждой страны коэффициент рационального использования будет являться средним значением рационального использования, взвешенным на долю в количестве морского рыбного промысла для каждого соответствующего района рыболовства, в котором страна осуществляет рыболовную деятельность. </p>\n<p> В настоящее время ФАО намерена приступить к составлению оценок на страновом уровне для показателя 14.4.1 ЦУР (доля рыбных запасов, находящихся в биологически устойчивых пределах) в 2020 году. Как только эти оценки станут доступны, метод расчета для текущего показателя будет скорее использовать оценки на уровне страны, а не оценки, основанные на важных районах рыбного промысла ФАО, чтобы определить коэффициент рационального использования и, следовательно, оценить добавленную стоимость устойчивого морского рыболовства как долю в ВВП. </p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div> <sup class = \" footnote-number \"id =\" footnote-8 \"> 8 </sup> <p> Самая последняя версия Обзора состояния мировых морских рыбных ресурсов, содержащего информацию о состоянии запасов, доступна по адресу \n<a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf</a><a href=\"#footnote-ref-8\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><h1>Методология</h1>\n<p>На страновом уровне вклад устойчивого морского рыболовства в ВВП рассчитывается следующим образом: </p>\n<p>a) Доля рыболовства и аквакультуры в ВВП оценивается простым делением добавленной стоимости рыболовства и аквакультуры (РиА) на национальный ВВП.</p>\n<p><em>Вклад в ВВП рыболовства и аквакультуры (%) = Добавленная стоимость рыболовства и аквакультуры / ВВП</em></p>\n<em>ВВП<sub>РиА</sub> = ДС<sub>РиА</sub>/ВВП</em></p>\n<p>b) Для того чтобы дезагрегировать добавленную стоимость морского рыболовства и добавленную стоимость аквакультуры, необходимо количество рыбы, добытой в результате морского рыболовства, разделить на общее количество национальной добычи рыбы, а затем умножить на долю рыболовства и аквакультуры в ВВП. Таким образом, количество продукции морского рыболовства используется в качестве косвенного показателя стоимости морского рыболовства. </p>\n<p><em>Косвенный показатель добавленной стоимости морского рыболовства (%)</em>\n<p><em>Доля в ВВП рыболовства и аквакультуры x (Количество добытой рыбы морского рыболовства / общее количество добытой рыбы)</em></p>\n<p><em>ДС<sub>Р </sub> ВВП<sub>РиА</sub> x (К<sub>М</sub>/К<sub>В</sub>)</em></p>\n<p>c)Коэффициент рационального использования будет рассчитываться на основе среднего значения рационального использования, периодически публикуемого для каждого важного района рыбного промысла ФАО. </p>\n<p>Для каждой страны коэффициентом рационального использования будет являться средним значением рационального использования, взвешенным на долю количества морского вылова для каждого соответствующего района рыболовства, в котором страна осуществляет рыболовную деятельность.
