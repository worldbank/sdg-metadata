{"status":"success","message":"The COVERAGE field for indicator 3-8-2, translated into en","data":"<h1>Data availability</h1>\n<p>This indicator relies primarily on the same data sources that are used to monitor SDG indicator 1.1.1 with the additional requirement of the availability of information regarding health expenditures. Taking this into account, the World Bank and WHO have identified 1566 potentially suitable household survey datasets from 155 countries. Some of these surveys were excluded because they were either inaccessible, lacked key variables required for the estimation of the proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health as a share of total household expenditure or income, they did not pass the quality assurance process or were not part of a consistent time series. As of December 2017 a total of 553 datapoints from 132 countries or territories spanning the period 1984-2015 have been used to produce SDG indicator 3.8.2. </p>\n<p>Data availability measured in
