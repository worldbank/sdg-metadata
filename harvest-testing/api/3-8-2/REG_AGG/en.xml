	<message>The REG_AGG field for indicator 3-8-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;To construct regional and global level estimates, when survey-based estimates are not available for the reference years of 2000, 2005 or 2010 all survey-based estimates within a 5 year window of the reference year are &amp;#x201C;lined-up&amp;#x201D; by using a combination of interpolation, extrapolation, econometric modelling and imputation based on regional medians ( Wagstaff et al.,2018; chapter 2 of the 2017 WHO and World Bank report on tracking universal health care coverage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank and the World Health Organization use their own regional grouping, in addition to the regional breakdown proposed for the SDG by UNSD. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
