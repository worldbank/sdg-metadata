	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Comments and limitations:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Survey estimates come with levels of uncertainty due to both sampling error and non-sampling error (e.g. mesasurement technical error, recording error etc.,). None of the two sources of errros have been fully taken into account for deriving estimates neither at country nor at regional and global levels. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
