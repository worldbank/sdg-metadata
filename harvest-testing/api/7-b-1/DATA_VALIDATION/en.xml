	<message>The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 7-b-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;All countries are invited to provide their capacity data or at least review the data that IRENA has compiled (from other official and unofficial sources) through an annual process of data collection using the IRENA Renewable Energy Questionnaire. This process is reinforced through IRENA&amp;#x2019;s renewable energy statistics training workshops, which are held twice a year in different (rotating) regions. To date, over 200 energy statisticians have participated in these workshops, many of whom provide renewable energy data to IRENA. In addition, IRENA&amp;#x2019;s statistics are presented each year to member countries at one of IRENA&amp;#x2019;s three governing body meetings, where discrepancies or other data issues can be discussed with country representatives.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
