	<data>&lt;p&gt;IRENA&amp;#x2019;s electricity capacity database contains information about the electricity generating capacity installed at the year-end, measured in MW. The dataset covers all countries and areas from the year 2000 onwards. The dataset also records whether the capacity is on-grid or off-grid and is split into 36 different renewable energy types that can be aggregated into the six main sources of renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Population data:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the population part of this indicator, IRENA uses population data from the United Nations World Population Prospects. The population data reflects the residents in a country or area regardless of legal status or citizenship. The values are midyear estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs published information about their methodology on the link below:&lt;/p&gt;
