	<data>&lt;p&gt;Countries are asked to designate a focal point to undertake the coordination at the country level necessary for the collection and validation of the data. Most designated focal points are within the NWMs, a number are within the NSOs and some are within both the NWMs and the NSOs. After verification,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-3&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-3&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the data with relevant laws, polices and other sources included, is sent to the designated focal points/country counterparts to review and validate. Final answers are arrived at after the process of validation with country counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-3&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; Verification includes information (eg national legal sources) compiled under World Bank Group and OECD Development Centre procedures by legal practitioners/researchers on gender equality. The World Bank Group&amp;#x2019;s Women, Business and the Law and the OECD Development Centre&amp;#x2019;s Social Institutions and Gender Index are two well-known global databases on national legal frameworks that promote gender equality which have been collecting data in this area for 10 and 9 years respectively. &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-3&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</data>
