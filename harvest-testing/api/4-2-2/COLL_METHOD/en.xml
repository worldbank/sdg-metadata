	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 4-2-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The UNESCO Institute for Statistics produces time series based on enrolment data reported by Ministries of Education or National Statistical Offices and population estimates produced by the UN Population Division. The enrolment data are gathered through the annual Survey of Formal Education. Countries are asked to report data according to the levels of education defined in the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) to ensure international comparability of resulting indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data received are validated using electronic error detection systems that check for arithmetic errors and inconsistencies and trend analysis for implausible results. Queries are taken up with the country representatives reporting the data so that corrections can be made (of errors) or explanations given (of implausible but correct results). During this process countries are also encouraged to provide estimates for missing or incomplete data items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, countries also have an opportunity to see and comment on the main indicators the UIS produces in an annual &amp;#x201C;country review&amp;#x201D; of indicators. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
