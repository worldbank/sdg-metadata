	<data>&lt;p&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationally-published figures may differ from the international ones because of differences between national education systems and the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED); or differences in coverage (i.e. the extent to which different types of education &amp;#x2013; e.g. private or special education &amp;#x2013; are included in one rather than the other) and/or between national and the United Nations Population Division (UNPD) population estimates.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
