	<message>The REG_AGG field for indicator 4-2-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regional aggregates:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional and global aggregates are calculated as weighted averages using the denominator of the indicator as the weight. As described previously, where publishable data are not available for a given country or year, values are imputed for the purpose of calculating the regional and global aggregates.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
