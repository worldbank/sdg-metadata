{"status":"success","message":"The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 8-1-1, translated into en","data":"<p>Sources of discrepancies: </p>\n<p>The differences with country data include the following: </p>\n<p> Official country data are typically available in domestic currency only. The data estimates for this indicator are in US dollars. </p>\n<p>Countries or areas may not have a full set of official GDP data. The GDP data estimated by UNSD include imputations using various estimation procedures as described above to obtain estimates for the entire time series. </p>\n<p>Official country data are often reported as multiple sets of time series versions, with each version representing a unique methodology used to compile the national accounts data (for example, a difference between two time series versions could reflect a change in currency, a switch from 1968 SNA to 1993 SNA, a change in the office responsible for compiling national accounts, etc.). These time series versions may not be comparable, especially when a country has shifted from the 1968 SNA to 1993 SNA or 2008 SNA. When a single time series version does not exist for the entire period (1970 to t-1), UNSD uses estimation procedures to backcast the most recently reported time series version. Backcasting is only performed when time series overlap for at least one year. The overlapping year is used to create a ratio; this ratio is then applied backwards to the previous time series version. If there is a change of fiscal year between two official data time series, the older series are converted to the fiscal year type of the most recent time series prior to backcasting. UNSD uses the same backcasting methods when official country constant price time series versions include multiple base years or when constant price time series versions are reported as constant prices of the previous year (CPPY). CPPY data are backcasted by using the officially reported current price data and the officially reported constant price data. The data are backcasted into a single series with a fixed base year. </p>\n<p>The population estimates from the United Nations Population Division may be different from country-produce estimates as the former include analysis carried out to take into account deficiencies such as incompleteness of coverage, lack of timeliness and errors in the reporting or coding of the basic information and to establish past population trends by resolving the inconsistencies affecting the basic data.</p>"}
