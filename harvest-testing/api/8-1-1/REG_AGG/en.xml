	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Regional and global aggregates:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each year, the real GDP and population estimates for each country or area are summed up to derive the regional and global aggregates. The regional and global aggregates are then divided by the corresponding population to derive the regional and global real GDP per capita estimates. These estimates are then used to calculate the annual growth rates in regional and global real GDP per capita using the formula as described above.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
