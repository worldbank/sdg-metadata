{"status":"success","message":"The STAT_CONC_DEF field for indicator 7-1-2, translated into en","data":"<h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>\n<h2>Definition:</h2>\n<p>Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology is calculated as the number of people using clean fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting divided by total population reporting that any cooking, heating or lighting, expressed as percentage. &#x201C;Clean&#x201D; is defined by the emission rate targets and specific fuel recommendations (i.e. against unprocessed coal and kerosene) included in the normative guidance WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: household fuel combustion.</p>\n<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n<p>Current global data collection focuses on the primary fuel used for cooking, categorized as solid or non-solid fuels, where solid fuels are considered polluting and non-modern, while non-solid fuels are considered clean. This single measure captures a good part of the lack of access to clean cooking fuels, but fails to collect data on type of device or technology is used for cooking, and also fails to capture other polluting forms of energy use in the home such as those used for lighting and heating.</p>\n<p>New evidence-based normative guidance from the WHO (i.e. WHO Guidelines for indoor air quality guidelines: household fuel combustion), highlights the importance of addressing both fuel and the technology for adequately protecting public health. These guidelines provide technical recommendations in the form of emissions targets for as to what fuels and technology (stove, lamp, and so on) combinations in the home are clean. These guidelines also recommend against the use of unprocessed coal and discourage the use kerosene (a non-solid but highly polluting fuel) in the home. They also recommend that all major household energy end uses (e.g. cooking, space heating, lighting) use efficient fuels and technology combinations to ensure health benefits.</p>\n<p>For this reason, the technical recommendations in the WHO guidelines, access to modern cooking solution in the home will be defined as &#x201C;access to clean fuels and technologies&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;access to non-solid fuels.&#x201D; This shift will help ensure that health and other &#x201C;nexus&#x201D; benefits are better counted, and thus realized.</p>"}
