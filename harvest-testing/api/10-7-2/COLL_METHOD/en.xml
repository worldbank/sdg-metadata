	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 10-7-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The Inquiry is conducted on behalf of the Secretary-General and is sent to all Permanent Missions in New York: 193 Member States, 2 observer States, and 2 non-member States. As per past practice, the Permanent Missions redirect the three thematic modules of the Inquiry to the relevant line ministries or government departments who are tasked with answering the questions. The Inquiry modules can be completed either through an online questionnaire or a fillable questionnaire in PDF. Countries responses are transmitted back to UN DESA for basic consistency checking. The data are then compiled/integrated into the World Population Policies database. The results of the Inquiry are disseminated though the database, updated every two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the collaboration on SDG indicator 10.7.2, IOM assisted in garnering country responses to Module III by following up through its respective country or regional counterparts. OECD, as partner agency for this indicator, supported these efforts for its member countries. The collaboration increased response rates from countries and improved the quality of the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data are to be collected biennially, to ensure that there is sufficient information to monitor progress in the achievement of the target. This will also allow for gathering benchmark data twice within each HLPF 4-year cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No adjustments to standard classifications are envisioned. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
