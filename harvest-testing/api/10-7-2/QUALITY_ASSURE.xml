  &lt;li&gt;Answers to the Inquiry are provided and validated directly by responding government entities. UN DESA, with support from IOM and OECD as needed, carried out basic consistency checking. Any inconsistencies are flagged to national counterparts for resolution. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since the indicator is informed directly by country responses to the Inquiry, no additional consultation process with countries on the national data submitted to the SDGs Indicators Database is envisaged. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
