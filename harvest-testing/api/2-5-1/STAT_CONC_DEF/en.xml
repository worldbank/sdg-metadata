	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Concepts and definitions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definition:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conservation of plant and animal genetic resources for food and agriculture (GRFA) in medium or long term conservation facilities (&lt;em&gt;ex situ&lt;/em&gt;, in genebanks) represents the most trusted means of conserving genetic resources worldwide. Plant and animal GRFA conserved in these facilities can be easily used in breeding programmes as well, even directly on-farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure of trends in &lt;em&gt;ex situ&lt;/em&gt; conserved materials provides an overall assessment of the extent to which we are managing to maintain and/or increase the total genetic diversity available for future use and thus protected from any permanent loss of genetic diversity which may occur in the natural habitat, i.e. &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt;, or on-farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two components of the indicator, plant and animal GRFA, are separately counted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plant genetic resources &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant component is calculated as the number of accessions of plant genetic resources secured in conservation facilities under medium or long term conditions, where an &amp;#x2018;accession&amp;#x2019; is defined as a distinct sample of seeds, planting materials or plants which is maintained in a genebank. Genebank Standards for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (accessible at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/7b79ee93-0f3c-5f58-9adc-5d4ef063f9c7/&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/7b79ee93-0f3c-5f58-9adc-5d4ef063f9c7/&lt;/a&gt;), set the benchmark for current scientific and technical best practices for conserving plant genetic resources, and support key international policy instruments for the conservation and use of plant genetic resources. These voluntary standards have been endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at its Fourteenth Regular Session (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/028/mg538e.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/028/mg538e.pdf&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal genetic resources &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animal component is calculated as the number of local breeds (i.e. being reported to exist only in one country) stored within a genebank collection with an amount of genetic material stored which is required to reconstitute the breed in case of extinction (further information on &amp;#x201C;sufficient material stored to reconstitute a breed&amp;#x201D; can be found in the Guidelines on Cryconservation of Animal Genetic Resources, FAO, 2012, accessible at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm&lt;/a&gt;). The guidelines have been endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at its Thirteenth Regular Session (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/024/mc192e.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/024/mc192e.pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plant genetic resources&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (PGRFA):&lt;/em&gt; Any genetic material of plant origin of actual or potential value for food and agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accession:&lt;/em&gt; An accession is defined as a sample of seeds, planting materials or plants representing either a wild population, a landrace, a breeding line or an improved cultivar, which is conserved in a genebank. Each accession should be distinct and, in terms of genetic integrity, as close as possible to the sample provided originally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Base collection:&lt;/em&gt; A base collection is defined as a set of unique accessions to be preserved for a medium to long-term period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Active collection:&lt;/em&gt; An active collection is defined as a set of distinct accessions that is used for regeneration, multiplication, distribution, characterization and evaluation. Active collections are maintained in short to medium-term storage and usually duplicated in a base collection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medium or long term conservation facilities:&lt;/em&gt; Biological diversity is often conserved &lt;em&gt;ex situ&lt;/em&gt;, outside its natural habitat, in facilities called genebanks. In the case of plant genetic resources, genebanks conserve base collections under medium or long term storage conditions, in the form of seeds in cold rooms, plants in the field and tissues &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and/or cryoconserved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal genetic resources&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breed:&lt;/em&gt; A breed is either a sub-specific group of domestic livestock with definable and identifiable external characteristics that enable it to be separated by visual appraisal from other similarly defined groups within the same species, or a group for which geographical and/or cultural separation from phenotypically similar groups has led to acceptance of its separate identity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medium or long term conservation facilities:&lt;/em&gt; Biological diversity is often conserved &lt;em&gt;ex situ&lt;/em&gt;, outside its natural habitat, in facilities called genebanks. In the case of domestic animal diversity, &lt;em&gt;ex situ&lt;/em&gt; conservation includes both the maintenance of live animals (&lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;) and cryoconservation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cryoconservation&lt;/em&gt; is the collection and deep-freezing of semen, ova, embryos or tissues for potential future use in breeding or regenerating animals.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
