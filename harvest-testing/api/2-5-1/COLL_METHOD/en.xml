	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Collection process:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is related to a monitoring framework endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture in which the status and trends of plant and animal genetic resources are described through globally agreed indicators and regular country-driven assessments. Officially appointed National Focal Points / National Coordinators report directly to FAO, using a format agreed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sessions of the intergovernmental technical working groups on plant and on animal genetic resources for food and agriculture allow for formal consultation processes.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
