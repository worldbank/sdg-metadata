	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 3-d-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Rationale:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revised International Health Regulations (IHR) were adopted in 2005 and entered into force in 2007 (available at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43883/1/9789241580410_eng.pdf&quot;&gt;http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43883/1/9789241580410_eng.pdf&lt;/a&gt;) . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the IHR, States Parties are obliged to develop and maintain minimum core capacities for surveillance and response, including at points of entry, in order to early detect, assess, notify, and respond to any potential public health events of international concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article 54 of the IHR request that States Parties and the Director-General shall report to the World Health Assembly on the implementation of these Regulations as decided by the World Health Assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the World Health Assembly, through the adoption of Resolution WHA61(2), and later on 2018 with the Resolution WHA71(15), decided that &amp;#x201C;that States Parties and the Director-General shall continue to report annually to the Health Assembly on the implementation of the International Health Regulations (2005), using the self-assessment annual reporting tool&amp;#x201D;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This SDG 3.d.1. indicator reflects the capacities State Parties of the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) had agreed and committed to develop. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
