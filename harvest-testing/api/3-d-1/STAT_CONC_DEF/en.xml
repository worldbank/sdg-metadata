	<data>&lt;p&gt;The revised International Health Regulations (IHR) were adopted in 2005 and entered into force in 2007. Under the IHR, States Parties are obliged to develop and maintain minimum core capacities for surveillance and response, including at points of entry, in order to early detect, assess, notify, and respond to any potential public health events of international concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article 54 of the IHR states that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;States Parties and the Director-General shall report to the Health Assembly on the implementation of these Regulations as decided by the Health Assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IHR self-assessment and reporting tool captures the level of self-assessed national capacities. They are essential public health capacities that States Parties are required to have in place throughout their territories pursuant to Articles 5 and 12, and Annex 1A of the IHR (2005) requirements. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
