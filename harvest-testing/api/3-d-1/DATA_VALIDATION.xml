&lt;p&gt;When the national authority is filling in the questionnaire, some electronic check is made automatically with pop-up alerts to help with potential mistakes and missing critical information on the report, before final submission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seminars are promoted tutorials are available and consultation with national authorities can be made, in coordination with all levels of WHO. &lt;/p&gt;
