The 13 core capacities are: (1) Legislation and financing; (2) IHR Coordination and National Focal Point Functions; (3) Zoonotic events and the Human-Animal Health Interface; (4) Food safety; (5) Laboratory; (6) Surveillance; (7) Human resources; (8) National Health Emergency Framework; (9) Health Service Provision; (10) Risk communication; (11) Points of entry; (12) Chemical events; (13) Radiation emergencies.</p>\n<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n<p><strong>Core capacity:</strong> the essential public health capacity that States Parties are required to have in place throughout their territories pursuant to Articles 5 and 12, and Annex 1A of the IHR (2005) requirements by the year 2012. Thirteen core capacities and 24 indicators are defined in this document. </p>\n<p><strong>Indicator</strong>: a variable that can be measured repeatedly (directly or indirectly) over time to reveal change in a system. It can be qualitative or quantitative, allowing the objective measurement of the progress of a programme or event. The quantitative measurements need to be interpreted in the broader context, taking other sources of information (e.g. supervisory reports and special studies) into consideration and they should be supplemented with qualitative information. </p>\n<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> one of a set of specific elements or characteristics that reflect the level of performance or achievement of a specific indicator. </p>\n<p><strong>Capability levels:</strong> Each attribute has been assigned a level of maturity, or a &#x2018;capability level.&#x2019; Attainment of a given capability level requires that all attributes at lower levels are in place. In the checklist, the status of core capacity development is measured at five capability levels, each of the 5 levels used is described by specific indicators, according related capacity.</p><h1>Data sources</h1>\n<h2>Description:</h2>\n<p>State Parties of IHR can use the on-line reporting tool, that reflects the questionnaire of the IHR State Parties Self-Assessment Tool was published in July 2018 (all references and results published at: <a href=\"https://extranet.who.int/e-spar/\">https://extranet.who.int/e-spar/</a>. </p>\n<p>The tool consists of 24 indicators for the thirteen IHR capacities needed to detect, assess, notify, report and respond, including at points of entry, to public health risk and acute events of domestic and international concern. </p>\n<p>For each of the 13 capacities, one to three indicators are used to measure the status of each capacity. Each indicator is based on five cumulative levels for annual reporting. For each indicator, the reporting State Party is asked to select which of the five levels best describes the State Party&#x2019;s current status. For each indicator, in order to move to the next level, all capacities described in previous levels should be in place. </p><h2>Collection process:</h2>\n<p>WHO receives the data send by each State Party from the Official IHR National Focal Point from designated officers that will have access to e-SPAR restrict page for reporting on line and consult all national reports submitted in the e-SPAR database. </p>\n<p>After submission of data by each State Party, State Party and WHO IHR staff involved in the specific report will receive acknowledgement message from e-SPAR, with summary of information provided. </p>\n<p>WHO also will review data received at all level of the organization, using the e-SPAR platform for monitoring and evaluation of results, before final report to the World Health Assembly is produced and published.</p>\n<p>Breakdown of results can be done by country, WHO administrative Regions, Capacities and its indicators.
