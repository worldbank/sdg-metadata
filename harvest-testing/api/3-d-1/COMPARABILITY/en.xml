	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 3-d-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The national IHR annual self-assessment and reporting have specific indicators, based on IHR requirements for core capacities needed to detect, assess, notify, report and respond, including at points of entry, to public health risk and acute events of domestic and international concern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;External voluntary evaluation of similar capacities can be done, by the same country, such as using the &amp;#x201C;Joint external evaluation tool&amp;#x201D;, supported by several countries, in complement to the self-assessment. More details at: Health Security and Emergency Preparedness (SPH) Portal (&lt;a href=&quot;https://extranet.who.int/sph/&quot;&gt;https://extranet.who.int/sph/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</data>
