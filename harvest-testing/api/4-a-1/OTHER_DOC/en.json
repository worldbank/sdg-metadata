Estimation methods followed those suggested by the respective organization providing the cross-national assessment data. All surveys utilized a two-stage sampling procedure, randomly selecting schools and within those classes or students. School-level (first stage) data was used to estimate the percentages of schools with the given facilities. Data was weighted by school sampling weights. The population which the sample of schools represented are presented in Annexe Table 1.</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"10\">\n        <p>Annex Table 1.
