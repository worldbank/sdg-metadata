{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 12-4-2, translated into all languages","data":{"ar":"","en":"<p>Data on hazardous waste generation and treatment may be scarce in some countries, due to a series of factors, such as lack of, or insufficient, policies and regulations on management and/or reporting; limited human, financial and technical resources within government agencies, lack of clear disclosure and reporting rules and requirements, and unwillingness of generators and public officials in certain countries to disclose the quantities of hazardous waste generated. Some countries may have the data and monitoring systems needed to report, while for others there is a need for training and capacity development to enhance data collection, validation and reporting capacity. </p>\n<p>Limitations in terms of usable data for calculating the indicator(s) may arise due to differences in the way of understanding the terminology used in the indicator or differences between these definitions and the definitions included in national legislation. This can lead to differences in reported values and difficulties in cross-checking of reported data. For example, by national legislation, countries may define additional types of waste to be considered as hazardous beyond the waste streams defined in the Basel Convention.</p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
