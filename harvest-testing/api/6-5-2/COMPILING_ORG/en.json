{"status":"success","message":"The COMPILING_ORG field for indicator 6-5-2, translated into en","data":"<h1>Data compilers</h1>\n<p>UNECE and UNESCO-IHP Reporting under the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Water Convention) will also gather the information needed for the calculation of the indicator, especially on the cooperation arrangements, transboundary waters covered by them as well as operationality. The Convention&#x2019;s regular reporting on transboundary water cooperation, involving both Parties and non-Parties to the Convention, will collect this information every 3 years as of 2017. The reporting covers transboundary rivers, lakes and groundwaters. UNESCO IHP will contribute to the reporting on transboundary aquifers. More than 100 countries participate in the Water Convention&#x2019;s activities. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe acts as Secretariat for the Water Convention. Some countries already report to regional organizations (e.g. the European Union or the Southern African Development Community) on the advancement of transboundary water cooperation, and similar arrangements could be strengthened and facilitated.</p>"}
