{"status":"success","message":"The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 6-5-2, translated into en","data":"<h1>Data sources</h1>\n<h2>Description:</h2>\n<p>At the country level, ministries and agencies responsible for surface water and groundwater resources (depends on the country but commonly ministry of the environment, water, natural resources, energy or agriculture; institutes of water resources, hydrology or geology, or geological surveys) typically have the spatial information about the location and extent of the surface water basin boundaries and aquifer delineations (as Geographical Information Systems shapefiles). Information on existing arrangement and their operationality is also commonly available from the same institutions.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Regular reporting contributing to the information collection</em></strong></p>\n<p>Reporting under the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Water Convention) will also gather the information needed for the calculation of the indicator, especially on the cooperation arrangements, transboundary waters covered by them as well as operationality. The Convention&#x2019;s regular reporting on transboundary water cooperation, involving both Parties and non-Parties to the Convention, will collect this information every 3 years as of 2017. The reporting covers trans-boundary rivers, lakes and ground waters. UNESCO IHP will contribute to the reporting on transboundary aquifers. More than 100 countries participate in the Water Convention&#x2019;s activities. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe acts as Secretariat for the Water Convention.</p>\n<p>Some countries already report to regional organizations on the advancement of transboundary water cooperation, and similar arrangements could be strengthened and facilitated.</p>\n<p>In the absence of available information at the national level global datasets on transboundary basins as well as about agreements and organizations for transboundary cooperation are available, which could be used in the absence of more detailed information, in the short term in particular.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Delineations of transboundary basins</em></strong></p>\n<p>In global databases, the most up-to-date delineations are available through the Transboundary Waters Assessment Programme (TWAP). TWAP covered 286 main transboundary rivers, 206 transboundary lakes and reservoirs and 199 transboundary aquifers. Relevant information have also been compiled for 592 transboundary aquifers by the UNESCO ISARM project. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Cooperation arrangements</em></strong></p>\n<p>Existence of treaties is available from the International Freshwater Treaties Database, maintained by Oregon State University (OSU). This was last updated to include all arrangements up to 2008. The treaty database includes in total 686 international freshwater treaties. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Organizations for transboundary water cooperation</em></strong></p>\n<p>International River Basin Organization (RBO) Database detailed information about over 120 international river basin organizations, including bilateral commissions, around the world. </p>\n<p>Regional assessments describing and inventorying agreements have been undertaken, contributing to the baseline globally, for example, regional inventories of transboundary aquifers under the UNESCO-IHP ISARM.</p>"}
