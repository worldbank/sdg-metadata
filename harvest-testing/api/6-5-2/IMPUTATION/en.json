{"status":"success","message":"The IMPUTATION field for indicator 6-5-2, translated into en","data":"<h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>At country level</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the case of spatial data: For the basin delineations, Digital Elevation Model information can be used to delineate surface water basin boundaries. For aquifers, geological maps can provide a basis for approximating aquifer extent. In the case of groundwater, uncertainty about transboundary nature remains unless investigations of hydraulic properties have been made. In the absence of administrative records, gaps about the cooperation arrangements are difficult to fill.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>At regional and global levels</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The indicator is not appropriate for countries without a terrestrial border, so notably island states will not be reporting a value on this indicator. International databases and inventories (as described in section 6) are available for reference in the absence of information reported by countries. Missing surface water basin extent can be extracted from Digital Elevation Models available globally. Global geological maps and maps of hydrogeology/groundwater potential also exist which could be used to approximate aquifer extent (surface area).</p>\n<p>Concerning agreements, consistency of information reported by co-riparian countries can be used to fill gaps in information about agreements and their operationality.</p>"}
