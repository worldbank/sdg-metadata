It is derived by adding up the surface area in a country of those transboundary surface water catchments and transboundary aquifers (i.e. &#x2018;transboundary&#x2019; basins) that are covered by an operational arrangement and dividing the obtained area by the aggregate total area in a country of all transboundary basins (both catchments and aquifers). The result is multiplied by 100 to obtain it expressed as percentage share.</p>\n<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n<p>&quot;The proposed monitoring has as basis the spatial coverage of transboundary basins shared by each country, and focuses on monitoring whether these are covered by cooperation arrangements that are operational. The criteria needing to be met for the cooperation on a specific basin being considered &#x201C;operational&#x201D; seeks to capture whether the arrangement(s) indeed provide an adequate basis for cooperation in water management. </p>\n<p>Transboundary basins are basins of transboundary waters, that is, of any surface waters (notably rivers, lakes) or groundwaters which mark, cross or are located on boundaries between by two or more states. For the purpose of the calculation of this indicator, for surface waters, the basin is the extent of the catchment area; for groundwater, the area considered is the extent of the aquifer. </p>\n<p>Arrangement for water cooperation: a bilateral or multilateral treaty, convention, agreement or other formal arrangement, such as memorandum of understanding) between riparian countries that provides a framework for cooperation on transboundary water management. Agreements or other kind of formal arrangements may be interstate, intergovernmental, interministerial, interagency or between regional authorities. </p>\n<p>Operational: For an agreement or other kind of formal arrangement (e.g. a memorandum of understanding) for cooperation between the riparian countries to be considered operational, all the following criteria needs to be fulfilled: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>There is a joint body, joint mechanism or commission (e.g. a river basin organization) for transboundary cooperation </li>\n  <li>There are regular formal communications between riparian countries in form of meetings </li>\n  <li>There is a joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or joint objectives have been set</li>\n  <li>There is a regular exchange of data and information.</li>\n</ul>"}
