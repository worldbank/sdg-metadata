	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 6-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Comments and limitations:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spatial information on transboundary surface water basins&amp;#x2019; boundaries and the extents of the catchment areas are commonly available and essentially static; consequently, once determined, no updating need is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information on the areal extent of transboundary aquifers may evolve over time as such information is generally more coarse but likely to improve because of the evolving knowledge on aquifers. Technical studies and exchange of information will improve the delineation and might also lead to the identification of additional transboundary aquifers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In situations where more than two riparian countries share a basin, but only some of them have operational cooperation arrangements, the indicator value may mask the gap that a riparian country does not have cooperation arrangements with both its upstream and downstream neighbours. Such complementary information can be obtained by aggregating data at the level of the basins but not from the reporting at the national level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal basis for cooperation develops slowly: conclusion of new agreements on transboundary waters is commonly a long process that takes many years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operationality of cooperation is more dynamic as it evolves with the expansion of cooperation. The operationality can be expected to evolve over shorter time frames, and in a year or two, progress could potentially be observed.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
