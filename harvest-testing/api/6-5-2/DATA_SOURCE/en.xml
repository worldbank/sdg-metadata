	<message>The DATA_SOURCE field for indicator 6-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Data providers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data are not so far included in the National Statistical Systems but the information needed to calculate the indicator is simple, does not require advanced monitoring capacities and is normally available to all countries at the ministries or agencies responsible for water resources. Spatial information (&amp;#x201C;transboundary basin area&amp;#x201D;) is normally available in ministries in charge of water resources. The value of this component is relatively fixed although the precision may vary (especially on aquifers), and may require only limited update on the basis of improved knowledge. Regarding operationality of arrangement the data needed for calculating the indicator can be directly obtained from information from administrative records (Member States have records of cooperation arrangements).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
