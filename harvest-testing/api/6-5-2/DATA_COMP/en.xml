	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Methodology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Computation method:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step 1 Identify the transboundary surface waters and aquifers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the identification of transboundary surface water is straightforward, the identification of transboundary aquifers requires investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are no transboundary surface waters or groundwaters, reporting is not applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step 2 Calculate the surface area of each transboundary basin and the total sum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commonly at least the basins of the rivers and lakes have been delineated through topographic maps and the basin area is known or easily measurable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total transboundary surface area in the country is the sum of the surface areas in the country of each of the transboundary basins and aquifers (expressed in km2). Transboundary areas for different types of systems (e.g. river basin and aquifer) or multiple aquifers may overlap. The area of transboundary aquifers, even if located within a transboundary river basin, should be added to be able to track progress of cooperation on transboundary aquifers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The calculations can most easily be carried with Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Once generated, with appropriate tools for spatial analysis, the shapes of the surface catchments and the aquifers can be used to report both disaggregated (for the surface water basin or aquifer) and aggregated (agreement exists on either one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step 3 Review existing arrangements for transboundary cooperation in water management and verify which transboundary waters are covered by a cooperation arrangement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some operational arrangements for integrated management of transboundary waters in place cover both surface waters and groundwaters. In such cases, it should be clear that the geographical extent of both is used to calculate the indicator value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other cases, the area of application may be limited to a border section of the watercourse and in such cases only the corresponding area should be considered as potentially having an operational arrangement for calculating the indicator value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of this step, it should be known which transboundary basins are covered by cooperation arrangements (and their respective areas). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step 4 Check which of the existing arrangements for transboundary cooperation in water management are operational&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following check-list allows determining whether the cooperation arrangement on a particular basin or in relation to a particular co-riparian country is operational:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;existence of a joint body, joint mechanism or commission for transboundary cooperation &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;regularity of formal communication in form of meetings &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;existence of joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or of joint objectives &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;regular exchange of information and data &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any of the conditions is not met, the cooperation arrangement cannot be considered operational. This information is currently available in countries and can also be withdrawn from global, regional or basin reporting systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step 5 Calculate the indicator value&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, the area share by adding up the surface area in the country of those transboundary surface water basins or aquifers that are covered by an operational cooperation arrangement and dividing it by the total summed up area in the country of all transboundary basins (including aquifers), multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage share.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
