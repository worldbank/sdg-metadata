{"status":"success","message":"The RATIONALE field for indicator 5-5-1a, translated into en","data":"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n<p>The indicator measures the degree to which women have equal access to parliamentary decision making. Women&#x2019;s participation in parliaments is a key aspect of women&#x2019;s opportunities in political and public life, and is therefore linked to women&#x2019;s empowerment. Equal numbers of women and men in lower chambers would give an indicator value of 50 per cent.</p>\n<p>A stronger presence of women in parliament allows new concerns to be highlighted on political agendas, and new priorities to be put into practice through the adoption and implementation of policies and laws. The inclusion of the perspectives and interests of women is a prerequisite for democracy and gender equality, and contributes to good governance. A representative parliament also allows the different experiences of men and women to affect the social, political and economic future of societies.</p>\n<p>Changes in the indicator have been tracked over time. Although the international community has supported and promoted women&#x2019;s participation in political decision-making structures for several decades, improvement in women&#x2019;s access to parliament has been slow. This has led to the introduction of special policy and legal measures to increase women&#x2019;s shares of parliamentary seats in several countries. Those countries that have adopted special measures generally have greater representation of women in parliament than countries without special measures.</p>"}
