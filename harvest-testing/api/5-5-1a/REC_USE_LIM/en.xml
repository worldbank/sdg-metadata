	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 5-5-1a, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Comments and limitations:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The number of countries covered varies with suspensions or dissolutions of parliaments. As of 1 February 2016, 193 countries are included.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There can be difficulties in obtaining information on by-election results and replacements due to death or resignation. These changes are ad hoc events which are more difficult to keep track of. By-elections, for instance, are often not announced internationally as general elections are.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The data excludes the numbers and percentages of women in upper chambers of parliament. The information in available on the IPU website at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ipu.org/women-ranking&quot;&gt;http://www.ipu.org/women-ranking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Parliaments vary considerably in their internal workings and procedures, however, generally legislate, oversee government and represent the electorate. In terms of measuring women&amp;#x2019;s contribution to political decision making, this indicator may not be sufficient because some women may face obstacles in fully and efficiently carrying out their parliamentary mandate.&lt;/li&gt;
