			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Global and regional indicators are weighted averages of national indicators with weights equal to the denominators indicated in section 3.3, a-g. Global and regional estimates are based on econometric models designed to impute missing data in countries for which nationally-reported data are unavailable. The output of the models is a complete set of single-year estimates for seven social protection indicators for 169 countries. The country-level data (reported and imputed) are then aggregated to produce global and regional estimates of the social protection indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
