A comparison can be made with past assessments and other existing data sources. Regular contacts between the main reporting entity and UNCCD secretariat via a help desk system, and through regional, sub-regional, and national workshops, will form part of this review process, enable data adjustments when needed, and contribute to building national capacities. The data will then be aggregated at sub-regional, regional and global levels by the UNCCD and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leveraging an already established reporting mechanism, this data flows and validation mechanism increases the efficiency with which UNCCD can gather data from countries. In addition, since the definitions and methodologies for reporting on SDG Indicator 15.3.1 are aligned with those adopted by the UNCCD, the reporting burden on countries and the need for harmonization/validation of the indicator values is reduced. Since national data and information to report on SDG Indicator 15.3.1 generally comes from outside the National Statistical Offices (NSOs), prior to submitting the data to the UN Statistical Division (UNSD), the UNCCD consults with the NSOs and requests them to review and validate the data submitted by their country as part of their national report. For those countries that have not submitted a national report, the UNCCD provides the NSOs with national estimates derived from global data sources for review and validation.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-32&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-32&quot;&gt;[31]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-32&quot;&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; https://www.unccd.int/sites/default/files/sessions/documents/2018-12/ICCD_CRIC%2817%29_8-1819696E.pdf &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-32&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
