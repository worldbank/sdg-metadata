	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 15-3-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data on the indicator and sub-indicators will be provided by national authorities (&amp;#x201C;main reporting entity&amp;#x201D;) to the UNCCD in their national reports following a standard format every four years beginning in 2018 or through other national data platforms and mechanisms endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission. This will include the original data and reference sources, and descriptions of how these have been used to derive the indicator and sub-indicators. Eligible (i.e. developing) countries will receive financial and technical assistance in preparing their national reports from the UNCCD and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;
