This will include the original data and reference sources, and descriptions of how these have been used to derive the indicator and sub-indicators. Eligible (i.e. developing) countries will receive financial and technical assistance in preparing their national reports from the UNCCD and its partners.</p>\n<p>Once received, national reports will undergo a review process by the UNCCD and its partners to ensure the correct use of definitions and methodology as well as internal consistency. A comparison can be made with past assessments and other existing data sources. Regular contacts between the main reporting entity and UNCCD secretariat via a help desk system, and through regional, sub-regional, and national workshops, will form part of this review process, enable data adjustments when needed, and contribute to building national capacities. The data will then be aggregated at sub-regional, regional and global levels by the UNCCD and its partners.</p>"}
