	<message>The IMPUTATION field for indicator 15-6-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; At country level&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the number of SMTA, the data is the number of SMTA reported through the online system of the International Treaty (Easy-SMTA) for each country, while the actual number of SMTA issued (signed) could be higher, as all SMTAs signed may not be reported through the online system and therefore not recorded. SMTA is a private contract, therefore it is reported by users, not by a government focal point. Users have also a two-year period for reporting their SMTAs, and therefore the number reported for a specific year would be fixed in two years (may also change during the two years). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; At regional and global levels&lt;/p&gt;</data>
