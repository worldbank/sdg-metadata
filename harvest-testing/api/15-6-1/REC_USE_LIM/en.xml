	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 15-6-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;This indicator can be used to measure progress in adopting ABS legislative, administrative and policy frameworks over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator does not assess the scope or effectiveness of ABS legislative, administrative and policy frameworks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of framework suggests that there is a complete set of rules established on access and benefit-sharing. However, it is difficult to have a predefined idea of what constitutes an ABS framework. In the context of this indicator, the publication by a country of one or more ABS legislative, administrative and policy measure in the ABS Clearing-House would be considered progress by that country on having an ABS legislative, administrative and policy framework, and through the Online Reporting System on Compliance of the International Treaty in relation to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
