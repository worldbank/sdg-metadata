&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; At regional and global levels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All countries are expected to fully report on this indicator more consistently starting in 2020 with few challenges where missing values will be reported due to missing base map files. Only limited cases of missing values are anticipated, which can emanate from situations where population growth figures are unavailable or where land consumption rates are inestimable due to lack or poor quality of multi-temporal coverage of satellite imagery. Because the values will be aggregated at the national levels from a national sample of cities, missing values will be less observed at national and global levels&lt;/p&gt;
