  &lt;li&gt;The annual AQUASTAT questionnaire, used for collecting information on SDG indicator 6.4.1 has been endorsed by FAO&amp;#x2019;s Office of the Chief Statistician (OCS).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;During the SDG reporting process, the OCS provides overall guidance, including metadata reporting, based on the Metadata Dissemination Standard approved by the FAO IDWG-Statistics Technical Task Force.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After revision and validation, SDG indicators are submitted to the OCS which also ensures the quality of the data and results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</data>
