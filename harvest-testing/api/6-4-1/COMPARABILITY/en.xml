	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 6-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional differences, in particular in relation to irrigated agriculture and different climatic conditions (including variability), are to be considered in the interpretation of this indicator, especially in countries with large amounts of available water resources. Also for this reason, coupling this indicator with water stress (6.4.2) is important for the interpretation of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Obtaining internationally comparable data for global monitoring:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data for this indicator are collected through a questionnaire/calculation sheet that allows countries to identify the needed parameters, and provide some preliminary control checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data so collected are then reviewed by FAO experts, also through the GEMI team if needed. The finding of the review is then shared with the country, in order to ensure consistency and harmonization of methods, definitions and results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAO has prepared a Step-by-step methodological paper, in order to provide a technical guide for the country teams. Moreover, an e-learning tool, in the form of a course on-line, is being prepared and will be ready early in 2018. Finally, an overall manual is being drafted.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
