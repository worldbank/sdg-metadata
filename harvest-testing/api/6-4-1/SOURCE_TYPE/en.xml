	<message>The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 6-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data needed for the calculation of the indicator are administrative data collected at country level by the relevant institutions, either technical (for water and irrigation) or economic (for value added). Official counterparts at country level are the national statistics offices and/or the line Ministry for water resources and irrigation. More specifically, FAO requests countries to nominate a National Correspondent to act as the focal point for the data collection and communication. Data are mainly published within national statistical yearbooks, national water resources and irrigation master plans, and other reports (such as those from projects, international surveys or results and publications from national and international research centres).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
