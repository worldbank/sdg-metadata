	<message>The REG_AGG field for indicator 10-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The aggregates are derived from the country level data (including country level imputed observations). The regional and global labour shares are obtained by first adding up, across countries, the numerator and denominator of the formula that define the labour share - outlined above. Once both magnitudes are produced at the desired level of aggregation, the ratio between the two is used to compute the share for each regional grouping and the global level. Notice that this direct aggregation method can be used due to the imputation of missing observations at the country level. For further information on the estimates, please refer to the ILO modelled estimates methodological overview, available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/ilo-modelled-estimates/&quot;&gt;https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/ilo-modelled-estimates/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</data>
