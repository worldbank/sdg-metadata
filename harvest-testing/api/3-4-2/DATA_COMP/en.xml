	<data>&lt;h1&gt;Methodology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Computation method:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suicide mortality rate (per 100,000 population) = (Number of suicide deaths in a year x 100,000) / Mid-year population for the same calendar year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The methods used for the analysis of causes of death depend on the type of data available from countries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For countries with a high-quality vital registration system including information on cause of death, the vital registration that member states submit to the WHO Mortality Database were used, with adjustments where necessary, e.g. for under-reporting of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For countries without high-quality death registration data, cause of death estimates are calculated using other data, including household surveys with verbal autopsy, sample or sentinel registration systems, special studies and surveillance systems. In most cases, these data sources are combined in a modelling framework.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
