	<data>&lt;p&gt;FGM is a violation of girls&amp;#x2019; and women&amp;#x2019;s human rights. There is a large body of literature documenting the adverse health consequences of FGM over both the short and long term. The practice of FGM is a direct manifestation of gender inequality &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FGM is condemned by a number of international treaties and conventions. Since FGM is regarded as a traditional practice prejudicial to the health of children and is, in most cases, performed on minors, it violates the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Existing national legislation in many countries also include explicit bans against FGM.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
