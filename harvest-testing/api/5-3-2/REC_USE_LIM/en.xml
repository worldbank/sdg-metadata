	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 5-3-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;There are existing tools and mechanisms for data collection that countries have implemented to monitor the situation with regards to this indicator. The modules used to collect information on the circumcision status of girls aged 0-14 and girls and women aged 15-49 in the DHS and MICS have been fully harmonized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on FGM inform policymakers of critically important variables in an effort to better understand the practice and develop policies for its abandonment. That said, these data must be analysed in light of the extremely delicate and often sensitive nature of the topic. Self-reported data on FGM need to be treated with caution for several reasons. Women may be unwilling to disclose having undergone the procedure because of the sensitivity of the issue or the illegal status of the practice in their country. In addition, women may be unaware that they have been cut or of the extent of the cutting, particularly if FGM was performed at an early age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data users should also keep in mind the retrospective nature of these data, which results in this indicator not being sensitive to recent change. For more details on interpretation and common pitfalls for this indicator, see: &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/A-Generation-to-Protect-publication-English_2020.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Generation to Protect: Monitoring violence exploitation and abuse of children within the SDG framework&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(UNICEF 2020). &lt;/p&gt;</data>
