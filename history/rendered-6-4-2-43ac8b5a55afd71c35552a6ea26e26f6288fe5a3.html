Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>
<h2>Definition:</h2>
<p>The level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources is the ratio between total freshwater withdrawn by all major sectors and total renewable freshwater resources, after taking into account environmental <del class="diffmod">water</del><ins class="diffmod">flow</ins> requirements. Main sectors, as defined by ISIC standards, include agriculture; forestry and fishing; manufacturing; electricity industry; and services. This indicator is also known as water withdrawal intensity.</p>
<h2>Concepts:</h2>
<p>This indicator provides an estimate of pressure by all sectors on the country&#x2019;s renewable freshwater resources. A low level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors is marginal in relation to the resources, and has therefore little potential impact on the sustainability of the resources or on the potential competition between users. A high level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors represents a substantial share of the total renewable freshwater resources, with potentially larger impacts on the sustainability of the resources and potential situations of conflicts and competition between users. </p>
<p>Total renewable freshwater resources (TRWR) are expressed as the sum of internal and external renewable water resources. The terms &#x201C;water resources&#x201D; and &#x201C;water withdrawal&#x201D; are understood here as freshwater resources and freshwater withdrawal. </p>
<p>Internal renewable water resources are defined as the long-term average annual flow of rivers and recharge of groundwater for a given country generated from endogenous precipitation. </p>
<p>External renewable water resources refer to the flows of water entering the country, taking into consideration the quantity of flows reserved to upstream and downstream countries through agreements or treaties. </p>
<p>Total freshwater withdrawal (<del class="diffmod">TWW</del><ins class="diffmod">TFWW</ins>) is the volume of freshwater extracted from its source (rivers, lakes, aquifers) for agriculture, industries and <del class="diffmod">municipalities</del><ins class="diffmod">services</ins>.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1"><ins class="mod"><ins class="diffins">[1]</ins></a></sup> It is estimated at the country level for the following three main sectors: agriculture, <del class="diffmod">municipalities</del><ins class="diffmod">services</ins> (including domestic water withdrawal) and industries<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;(including cooling of thermoelectric plants)</ins>. Freshwater withdrawal includes<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;primary freshwater (not withdrawn before), secondary freshwater (previously withdrawn and returned to rivers and groundwater, such as discharged wastewater and agricultural drainage water) and</del> fossil groundwater. It does not include non-conventional water, i.e. direct use of treated wastewater, direct use of agricultural drainage water and desalinated water. <del class="diffdel">TWW is in general calculated as being the sum of total water withdrawal by sector minus direct use of wastewater, direct use of agricultural drainage water and use of desalinated water. </del></p>
<p>Environmental <del class="diffmod">water</del><ins class="diffmod">flow</ins> requirements (<del class="diffmod">Env.</del><ins class="diffmod">EFR</ins>) are <ins class="diffins">defined as </ins>the <del class="diffmod">quantities</del><ins class="diffmod">quantity and timing</ins> of <del class="diffmod">water</del><ins class="diffmod">freshwater</ins> <del class="diffmod">required</del><ins class="diffmod">flows and levels necessary</ins> to sustain <del class="diffmod">freshwater</del><ins class="diffmod">aquarian ecosystems, which, in turn, support human cultures, economies, sustainable livelihoods,</ins> and <del class="diffmod">estuarine ecosystems</del><ins class="diffmod">wellbeing</ins>.

Rationale (RATIONALE)</div></div></div><h2>Rationale:</h2>
<p>The purpose of this indicator is to show the degree to which water resources are being exploited to meet the country&apos;s water demand. It measures a country&apos;s pressure on its water resources and therefore the challenge on the sustainability of its water use. It tracks progress in regard to &#x201C;withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity&#x201D;, i.e. the environmental component of target 6.4.</p>
<p>The indicator shows to what extent water resources are already used, and signals the importance of effective supply and demand management policies. It indicates the likelihood of increasing competition and conflict between different water uses and users in a situation of increasing water scarcity. Increased water stress, shown by an increase in the value of the indicator, has potentially negative effects on the sustainability of the natural resources and on economic development. On the other hand, low values of the indicator indicate that water does not represent a particular challenge for economic development and sustainability.</p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><ins class="diffins">However, extremely low values may indicate the inability of a country to use properly its water resources for the benefit of the population. In such cases, a moderate and controlled increase in the value of the indicator can be a sign of positive development.</ins></p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.b. Comment and limitations (REC_USE_LIM)</div></div></div><h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>
<p><del class="diffmod">Water</del><ins class="diffmod">Freshwater</ins> withdrawal as a percentage of <del class="diffmod">water</del><ins class="diffmod">renewable freshwater</ins> resources is a good indicator of pressure on limited water resources, one of the most important natural resources. However, it only partially addresses the issues related to sustainable water management. </p>
<p>Supplementary indicators that capture the multiple dimensions of water management would combine data on water demand management, behavioural changes with regard to water use and the availability of appropriate infrastructure, and measure progress in increasing the efficiency and sustainability of water use, in particular in relation to population and economic growth. They would also recognize the different climatic environments that affect water use in countries, in particular in agriculture, which is the main user of water. Sustainability assessment is also linked to the critical thresholds fixed for this indicator<ins class="diffins">.</ins> <del class="diffmod">and</del><ins class="diffmod">Although</ins> there is no universal consensus on such <del class="diffmod">threshold</del><ins class="diffmod">thresholds, a proposal is presented below</ins>. </p>
<p>Trends in <del class="diffmod">water</del><ins class="diffmod">freshwater</ins> withdrawal show relatively slow patterns of change. Usually, three-five years are a minimum frequency to be able to detect significant changes, as it is unlikely that the indicator would show meaningful variations from one year to the other. </p>
<p>Estimation of water withdrawal by sector <del class="diffmod">is</del><ins class="diffmod">may</ins> <del class="diffmod">the</del><ins class="diffmod">represent</ins> <del class="diffmod">main</del><ins class="diffmod">a</ins> limitation to the computation of the indicator. Few countries actually publish water <del class="diffmod">use</del><ins class="diffmod">withdrawal</ins> data on a regular basis by sector. </p><del class="diffdel">
</del><p><del class="diffdel">Renewable water resources include all surface water and groundwater resources that are available on a yearly basis without consideration of the capacity to harvest and use this resource. Exploitable water resources, which refer to the volume of surface water or groundwater that is available with an occurrence of 90% of the time, are considerably less than renewable water resources, but no universal method exists to assess such exploitable water resources.</del></p>
<p>There is no universally agreed method for the computation of incoming freshwater flows originating outside of a country&apos;s borders. Nor is there any standard method to account for return flows, the part of the water withdrawn from its source and which flows back to the river system after use. In countries where return flow represents a substantial part of water withdrawal, the indicator tends to underestimate available water and therefore overestimate the level of water stress. </p>
<p>Other limitations that affect the interpretation of the water stress indicator include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>difficulty to obtain accurate, complete and up-to-date data; </li>
  <li>potentially large variation of sub-national data; </li>
  <li>lack of account of seasonal variations in water resources;</li>
  <li>lack of consideration to the distribution among water uses; </li>
  <li>lack of consideration of water quality and its suitability for use; and</li>
  <li>the indicator can be higher than 100 per cent when water withdrawal <del class="diffdel">includes secondary freshwater (water withdrawn previously and returned to the system), </del>non-renewable water (fossil groundwater), when annual groundwater withdrawal is higher than annual replenishment (over-abstraction) or when water withdrawal includes part or all of the water set aside for environmental water requirements. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these issues can be solved through disaggregation of the <del class="diffmod">index</del><ins class="diffmod">indicator</ins> at the level of hydrological units and by distinguishing between different use sectors. However, due to the complexity of water flows, both within a country and between countries, care should be taken not to double-count.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.c. Method of computation (DATA_COMP)</div></div></div><h1>Methodology</h1>
<h2>Computation method:</h2>
<p>Method of computation: The indicator is computed as the total freshwater withdrawn (<del class="diffmod">TWW</del><ins class="diffmod">TFWW</ins>) divided by the difference between the total renewable freshwater resources (TRWR) and the environmental <del class="diffmod">water</del><ins class="diffmod">flow</ins> requirements (<del class="diffmod">Env.</del><ins class="diffmod">EFR</ins>), multiplied by 100. All variables are expressed in km<sup>3</sup>/year (10<sup>9</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/year).</p>
<p>Stress (%) = <del class="diffmod">TWW</del><ins class="diffmod">TFWW</ins> / (TRWR - <del class="diffmod">Env.</del><ins class="diffmod">EFR</ins>) * 100</p>
<p><del class="diffmod">It is proposed to classify</del><ins class="diffmod">Following</ins> the <del class="diffmod">level</del><ins class="diffmod">experience of the initial five years of application of the indicator, and consistent with the approach taken during the MDG program, the threshold of 25% has been identified as the upper limit for a full and unconditional safety</ins> of water stress <del class="diffmod">in</del><ins class="diffmod">as</ins> <del class="diffmod">three</del><ins class="diffmod">assessed</ins> <del class="diffmod">main categories (levels): low, high and very high.

Regional aggregations (REG_AGG)</div></div></div><h2>Regional aggregates:</h2>
<p>Regional and global estimates will be done by summing up the national figures on renewable freshwater resources and total freshwater withdrawal, considering only the internal renewable water resources of each country in order to avoid double counting<ins class="diffins">, and the external renewable freshwater resources of the region as a whole if any. In case of regional aggregation without physical continuity (such as income groupings or Least Developed Countries group, etc.), total renewable water resources are summed up. The EFR at regional level is estimated as the average of the countries&#x2019; EFRs, in percentage, and applied to the regional water resources</ins>.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.h.

<p>This indicator provides an estimate of pressure by all sectors on the country&#x2019;s renewable freshwater resources. A low level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors is marginal in relation to the resources, and has therefore little potential impact on the sustainability of the resources or on the potential competition between users. A high level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors represents a substantial share of the total renewable freshwater resources, with potentially larger impacts on the sustainability of the resources and potential situations of conflicts and competition between users.</p>
<p>The indicator is computed based on three components:</p>
<p><strong>Total renewable freshwater resources (TRWR)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Total freshwater withdrawal (<del class="diffmod">TWW</del><ins class="diffmod">TFWW</ins>)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Environmental flow requirements (EFR)</strong> </p>

The process of collecting and checking the data has resulted in the establishment of a unique network of collaborators who provide data, use data from other countries for comparative purposes, and exchange views and experiences on how best to measure and account for water-related use. Users range from international private companies to non-governmental organizations, and virtually all significant reports related to water depend on the data provided by AQUASTAT.<br><a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc817e.pdf">http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc817e<ins class="diffins">.pdf</ins></a></p><ins class="diffins">

<p><strong><em>Cooling water for energy generation and its impact on national-level water statistics</em>&#xA0;<br></strong>This technical note, describing the issue of cooling water for energy generation and its impact on national-level water statistics, has two purposes: 1) to act as a general informational resource and 2) to encourage governmental agencies responsible for water usage to gather and report information disaggregated by sub-sector (keeping thermoelectric withdrawals separate from industrial and hydroelectric withdrawals), and to determine the point at which lower water withdrawal designs are more favourable, even if the required capital cost is higher.<br><a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc822e.pdf">http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc822e.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong><em>Municipal and industrial water withdrawal modelling for the years 2000 and 2005 using statistical methods</em>&#xA0;<br></strong>This document describes the efforts to generate models that estimate the municipal and industrial water withdrawals for the years 2000 and 2005.&#xA0;<br><a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc821e.pdf">http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc821e.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong><em>Disambiguation of water statistics</em>&#xA0;<br></strong>The nomenclature surrounding water information is often confusing and gives rise to different interpretations and thus confusion. When discussing the way in which renewable water resources are utilized, the terms water use, usage, withdrawal, consumption, abstraction, extraction, utilization, supply and demand are often used without clearly stating what is meant.&#xA0;<br><a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc816e.pdf">http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc816e.pdf</a></p>

<p><strong><em>International Recommendations for Water Statistics</em><br></strong>The International Recommendations for Water Statistics (IRWS) were developed to help strengthen national information systems for water in support of design and evaluation of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) policies.<br><a href="https://unstats.un.org/UNSD/envaccounting/irws/">https://unstats.un.org/UNSD/envaccounting/irws/</a></p>

Quality assurance (QUALITY_ASSURE)</div></div></div><h2>Quality assurance:</h2>
<p>Every data in AQUASTAT goes through a thorough validation process.</p>
<p>Before uploading, data is compared to other variables to ensure it is logically correct (in other words: 1+2=3) and whether the reference used is not leading back to AQUASTAT itself. In other words, AQUASTAT frequently finds data for 2014, which is really AQUASTAT data for 2000 with the year changed (most probably when the data was harvested).</p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Also during the validation process each new data-point is compared to other data already available for this variable in other years or in the same year. If it is impossible to harmonize or reconcile the different data, then one or the other data-point has to be deleted from the database. </ins></p>
<p>During uploading into the Main Database, another validation process takes place, using a set of about 300 validation rules. Of these, about 100 rules are obligatory rules, which means that if the data-point doesn&apos;t obey this rule, the validation process cannot go on. For example, the cultivated area of a country cannot be larger than the total area of the country. The other set of about 200 validation rules are warning signs for the person doing the validation. For example, in general the area equipped for irrigation using surface irrigation technology is at least half of the total area equipped for irrigation. However, in some countries the localized irrigation area or the sprinkler irrigation area might be larger than the surface irrigation area. If this is the case, then a warning pops up during validation for the analyst to check whether for this country it is possible. <del class="diffdel">Also during the validation process each new data-point is compared to other data already available for this variable in other years or in the same year. If it is impossible to harmonize or reconcile the different data, then one or the other data-point has to be deleted from the database. </del></p><del class="diffdel">

<p>Beyond the usual AQUASTAT validation described above, in the compilation of the indicator countries will be encouraged and supported in setting up their own quality control system, ensuring that all data used in the computation are checked, and that consistency is kept over the years to ensure comparability and robust identification of trends.</p>
<p>The indicator requires data from different sectors of expertise. Internationally, they are available of different datasets from various institutions, such as FAO, UNSD and IWMI. Each of these institutions has its own established mechanism to consult and validate the data with the countries.</p>
<p>For the data deriving from FAOSTAT and AQUASTAT, data are collected in countries through surveys consisting of data collection and country description by means of a detailed questionnaires were the source reference and comments are associated with each value, through <ins class="diffins">officially nominated </ins>national resource persons. Critical analysis of information and data processing is done by FAO staff. <del class="diffdel">Data are then organized in standard data tables, and feedback and approval is sought from national institutions before publication and dissemination.</del></p>
<p>However, for the SDG process a specific mechanism will be put in place, consisting in the identification in each country, by the national government, of a national focal point and a technical team, in charge of the collection and computation of the indicator, in close consultation with FAO. This system has been successfully tested during the initial phase of the GEMI project, carried out by FAO and other seven UN agencies, coordinated by UN-Water.</p>
<p>For those countries that could initially have difficulties in compiling and computing the indicator, FAO will provide support and ultimately will be able to produce the indicator starting from internationally available data. However, no data will be made public without the prior approval by the relevant national authorities.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">5.
