            <span class="d2h-code-line-ctn">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water-related ecosystems&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; are a sub-set of all ecosystems. They contain the world&amp;#x2019;s freshwater resources and can be defined as &amp;#x201C;a dynamic complex of plant, animal, and micro-organism communities and the non-living environment dominated by the presence of flowing or still water, interacting as a functional unit.&amp;#x201D; (MEA, 2005; Dickens et al, 2019). The indicator is framed around the monitoring of different types of water-related ecosystems including lakes, rivers, wetlands, groundwater and artificial waterbodies such as reservoirs. These water-related ecosystems contain freshwater, with the exception of mangroves which contain brackish water (i.e. a combination of fresh and saltwater) however mangroves are still included within indicator 6.6.1. Reservoirs are also included as a category of water-related ecosystem within the indicator methodology; while it is recognized that reservoirs are not traditional water ecosystems which should necessarily warrant protection and restoration, in many countries they hold a noteworthy amount of freshwater and have thus been included. By including data on reservoirs, it is intended that countries can better understand changes occurring to artificial water bodies in conjunction with changes occurring to natural water bodies. Ecosystems that are not included under indicator 6.6.1 are: coral reefs and sea grass which are covered within Goal 14 (Oceans); and mountains, forests, and drylands which are covered within Goal 15 (Land). The extent to which each of the water-related ecosystems included under indicator 6.6.1 can be measured, uses one or more of the following physical parameters of change: spatial area, quantity (or volume) of water, and water quality. The full monitoring methodology for indicator 6.6.1 is available here. The extent to which each of the water-related ecosystems included under indicator 6.6.1 can be measured, uses one or more of the following physical parameters of change: spatial area, quantity (or volume) of water, and water quality.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</span>

Inland vegetated wetlands do not include coastal mangroves. Data on mangroves which are produced separately to inland wetlands. This SDG indicator methodology is used for official reporting of SDG indicator 6.6.1 statistics. The SDG indicator 6.6.1 methodology does not apply the definition of wetlands defined by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, which is: &amp;#x201C;areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six meters&amp;#x201D;. The Ramsar definition of wetlands may be interpreted to mean all water within a country including the marine environment.

Some locations don&amp;#x2019;t have observations for all 12 months of the year (for reasons such as polar night).

If water is present throughout the observation period (i.e. unfrozen period), the water body is considered as a permanent water surface. If the area of the water body contracts during the unfrozen period, then the pixels along the borders of the lake or river are no longer water, and those pixels will be considered as a seasonal water surface.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</span>

            <span class="d2h-code-line-ctn">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water-related ecosystems&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; are a sub-set of all ecosystems. They contain the world&amp;#x2019;s freshwater resources and can be defined as &amp;#x201C;a dynamic complex of plant, animal, and micro-organism communities and the non-living environment dominated by the presence of flowing or still water, interacting as a functional unit.&amp;#x201D; (MEA, 2005; Dickens et al, 2019). The indicator is framed around the monitoring of different types of water-related ecosystems including lakes, rivers, wetlands, groundwater and artificial waterbodies such as reservoirs. These water-related ecosystems contain freshwater, with the exception of mangroves which contain brackish water (i.e. a combination of fresh and saltwater) however mangroves are still included within indicator 6.6.1. Reservoirs are also included as a category of water-related ecosystem within the indicator methodology; while it is recognized that reservoirs are not traditional water ecosystems which should necessarily warrant protection and restoration, in many countries they hold a noteworthy amount of freshwater and have thus been included. By including data on reservoirs, it is intended that countries can better understand changes occurring to artificial water bodies in conjunction with changes occurring to natural water bodies. Ecosystems that are not included under indicator 6.6.1 are: coral reefs and sea grass which are covered within Goal 14 (Oceans); and mountains, forests, and drylands which are covered within Goal 15 (Land). The extent to which each of the water-related ecosystems included under indicator 6.6.1 can be measured, uses one or more of the following physical parameters of change: spatial area, quantity (or volume) of water, and water quality. The full monitoring methodology for indicator 6.6.1 is available here. The extent to which each of the water-related ecosystems included under indicator 6.6.1 can be measured, uses one or more of the following physical parameters of change: spatial area, quantity (or volume) of water, and water quality.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</span>

Inland vegetated wetlands do not include coastal mangroves. Data on mangroves which are produced separately to inland wetlands. This SDG indicator methodology is used for official reporting of SDG indicator 6.6.1 statistics. The SDG indicator 6.6.1 methodology does not apply the definition of wetlands defined by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, which is: &amp;#x201C;areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six meters&amp;#x201D;. The Ramsar definition of wetlands may be interpreted to mean all water within a country including the marine environment. The SDG indicator 6.6.1 definition refers to only a specific group of inland vegetated wetlands typologies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</span>

If the area of the water body contracts during the unfrozen period, then the pixels along the borders of the lake or river are no longer water, and those pixels will be considered as a seasonal water surface.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</span>

            <span class="d2h-code-line-ctn">&lt;p&gt;In developing the methodology for indicator 6.6.1 UNEP set up a technical expert group . This group provided inputs into the development of the monitoring methodology. A first draft (Tier III) methodology was piloted in 2017 and sent to all UN Member States accompanied with relevant capacity support materials. A limited number of Member States (19 per cent) submitted data to UNEP after a period of 8 months. The data that was received was of poor quality and coverage. Countries cited a lack of data to report, and neither time nor resources to initiate new ecosystem monitoring.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</span>

            <span class="d2h-code-line-ctn">&lt;p&gt;Following on from the global piloting and testing phase, and to address a known global data gap for the indicator, the methodology was revised to incorporate data on water-related ecosystem derived from satellite-based Earth observations. UNEP engaged with a series of partners working with global data products considered relevant and suitable for the indicator. The assessment of global data sources considered data quality, resolution, frequency of measurements, global coverage, time series, and scalability (i.e. disaggregated data at national and sub-national levels). The result was a methodology that is statistically robust producing internationally comparable data without being too onerous for countries to report on. The technical expert group was consulted on the updated methodology before submission to the IAEG-SDG for approval. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</span>

            <span class="d2h-code-line-ctn">&lt;p&gt;At the 7th IAEG-SDG meeting in April 2018 the indicator methodology was approved and classified as Tier II. Shortly afterwards, in November 2018, it was reclassified to a Tier I indicator methodology. The Tier I classification means that the indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, and data are regularly produced by at least 50 per cent of countries and of the population in every region where the indicator is relevant.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</span>

            <span class="d2h-code-line-ctn">&lt;p&gt;In developing the methodology for indicator 6.6.1 UNEP set up a technical expert group . This group provided inputs into the development of the monitoring methodology. A first draft (Tier III) methodology was piloted in 2017 and sent to all UN Member States accompanied with relevant capacity support materials. A limited number of Member States (19 per cent) submitted data to UNEP after a period of 8 months. The data that was received was of poor quality and coverage. Countries cited a lack of data to report, and neither time nor resources to initiate new ecosystem monitoring.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</span>

            <span class="d2h-code-line-ctn">&lt;p&gt;Following on from the global piloting and testing phase, and to address a known global data gap for the indicator, the methodology was revised to incorporate data on water-related ecosystem derived from satellite-based Earth observations. UNEP engaged with a series of partners working with global data products considered relevant and suitable for the indicator. The assessment of global data sources considered data quality, resolution, frequency of measurements, global coverage, time series, and scalability (i.e. disaggregated data at national and sub-national levels). The result was a methodology that is statistically robust producing internationally comparable data without being too onerous for countries to report on. The technical expert group was consulted on the updated methodology before submission to the IAEG-SDG for approval. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</span>

            <span class="d2h-code-line-ctn">&lt;p&gt;At the 7th IAEG-SDG meeting in April 2018 the indicator methodology was approved and classified as Tier II. Shortly afterwards, in November 2018, it was reclassified to a Tier I indicator methodology. The Tier I classification means that the indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, and data are regularly produced by at least 50 per cent of countries and of the population in every region where the indicator is relevant.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</span>

As such, this methodology was updated in March 2020 to include more detailed information about the approach used to obtain satellite-based Earth observation data with regard to the sub-indicators.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</span>
