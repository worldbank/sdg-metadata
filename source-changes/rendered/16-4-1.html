Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
<p>The Indicator measures the total value of inward and outward illicit financial flows (IFFs) in current United States dollars. IFFs are defined as &#x201C;financial flows that are illicit in origin, transfer or use, that reflect an exchange of value and that cross country borders&#x201D;.</p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p>IFFs are defined as &#x201C;<strong>financial flows that are illicit in origin, transfer or use, that reflect an exchange of value and that cross country borders</strong>&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Thus, IFFs have the following features: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Illicit in origin, transfer or use</strong>. A flow of value is considered illicit if it is illicitly generated (e.g.<ins class="diffins">,</ins> originates from criminal activities or tax evasion), illicitly transferred (e.g.<ins class="diffins">,</ins> violating currency controls) or illicitly used (e.g.<ins class="diffins">,</ins> for financing terrorism). The flow can be licitly generated, transferred or used, but it must be illicit in at least one of these aspects. Some flows that are not illegal may fall within the definition of IFFs for statistical purposes, for example, cross-border<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;aggressive</ins> tax avoidance which erodes the tax base of a country where that income was generated. </li>
  <li><strong>Exchange of value</strong>, rather than purely financial transfers. Exchange of value includes exchange of goods and services, and financial and non-financial assets. For instance, illicit cross-border bartering, meaning the illicit exchange of goods and services for other goods and services, is a common practice in illegal markets and it is considered as IFF.</li>
  <li>IFFs measure <strong>a flow of value over a given time</strong> - as opposed to a stock measure, which would be the accumulation of value. </li>
  <li><strong>Flows that cross a border</strong>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[1]</a></sup></sup> This includes assets that cross borders and assets where the ownership changes from a resident of a country to a non-resident, even if the assets remain in the same jurisdiction. </li>
</ul>
<p>There are four main types of activities that can generate IFFs:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em><u>Illicit tax and commercial <del class="diffmod">IFFs</del><ins class="diffmod">practices</ins></u></em>: These include illicit practices by legal entities as well as arrangements and individuals with the objective of concealing revenues and reducing tax burden through evading controls and regulations. This category can be divided into two components: <ul>
      <li><strong>IFFs from illegal commercial activities and tax evasion</strong>. These include illegal practices such as tariff, duty and revenue offences, tax evasion, competition offences and market manipulation amongst others, as included in the <ins class="diffins">International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (</ins>ICCS<ins class="diffins">)</ins><sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><ins class="mod"><ins class="diffins">[2]</ins></a></sup>. Most of these activities are non-observed, hidden or part of the shadow, underground or informal economy that may generate IFFs. </li>
      <li><strong>IFFs from aggressive tax avoidance</strong>. Illicit flows can also be generated from legal economic activities through aggressive tax avoidance. This can take place through the manipulation of transfer pricing, strategic location of debt and intellectual property, tax treaty shopping and the use of hybrid instruments and entities. These flows need to be carefully considered, as they generally arise from legal business transactions and only the illicit part of the cross-border flows belongs within the scope of IFFs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li><ins class="diffins">
  </ins><li><em><u><ins class="diffins">IFFs from illegal markets</ins></u></em><ins class="diffins">: These include trade in illicit goods and services when the corresponding financial flows cross borders. The focus is on criminal activities where income is generated through exchange (trade) of illegal goods or services. Such processes often involve a degree of criminal organisation aimed at creating profit. They include any type of trafficking in goods, such as drugs and firearms, or services, such as smuggling of migrants. IFFs emerge from transnational trade in illicit goods and services, as well as from cross-border flows from managing the illicit income from such activities.</ins></li>
  <li><em><u>IFFs from corruption</u></em>: The United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) defines acts considered as corruption, and they are consistently defined in the ICCS, such as bribery, embezzlement, abuse of functions, trading in influence, illicit enrichment and other acts of corruption in the scope. When these acts &#x2013; directly or indirectly - generate cross-border flows, they generate IFFs. </li>
  <li><em><u>Exploitation-type activities, and financing of crime and terrorism:</u></em> Exploitation-type activities are non-productive activities that entail a forced, involuntary and illicit transfer of economic resources between two actors. Terrorism financing and financing of crime are illicit, voluntary transfers of funds between two actors. Examples of exploitation-type activities are sexual exploitation, theft, extortion, illicit enrichment, and kidnapping. When the related financial flows cross country borders, they constitute IFFs<del class="diffdel">.</del></li><del class="diffdel">
  </del><li><em><u><del class="diffdel">IFFs from illegal markets</del><del class="diffdel">: These include trade in illicit goods and services when the corresponding financial flows cross borders.

</ul>
<p>Other relevant concepts include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em><u>Inward IFFs</u></em>: IFFs entering a country.</li>
  <li><em><u>Outward IFFs</u></em>: IFFs leaving a country.</li>
  <li><em><u>Illicit income generation</u></em>: This refers to the set of transactions that either directly generate illicit income for an actor during a productive or non-productive illicit activity, or that are performed in the context of the production of illicit goods and services. A transaction constitutes an IFF when it crosses country borders.</li>
  <li><em><u>Illicit income management</u></em>: These transactions use illicit income to invest in (legal or illegal) financial and non-financial assets or to consume (legal or illegal) goods and services. A transaction constitutes an IFFs when it crosses country borders.</li>
  <li><em><u>Illegal markets</u></em> comprise all transactions related to the production and the trade with a certain illicit good or service. Regardless of the illicit nature, these market activities are considered as being economically productive, because value added is generated at each transaction. The value added describes the net increase in value (price times quantity) of the product at each transaction.</li>

Data sources (SOURCE_TYPE)</div></div></div><p>The measurement of IFFs requires combining data held by different entities of the national statistical system and beyond, especially national statistical offices, customs and tax authorities, financial intelligence centres and central banks. The balance of payments and system of national accounts data on illegal economic activities and non-observed economy provide a good starting point for the measurement of IFFs. Trade transactions data, held by customs, are essential for analysing the commercial IFFs, including trade misinvoicing. Statistics on international trade in goods and services, financial and business statistics as well as foreign affiliates statistics collate relevant data for estimating commercial IFFs. Similarly, tax returns at individual (person or firm) level can be used for analysing IFFs related to tax avoidance and evasion. Additionally, where established, large case units (LCUs) of national statistical offices offer indispensable expert knowledge particularly in the field of profit shifting and related tax and commercial IFFs. </p>
<p>Given the transnational nature of the Indicator, data available in other countries can support the calculation of national measures.<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del><sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5">[<del class="diffmod">3</del><ins class="diffmod">4</ins>]</a></sup> The following existing data collection systems collect data relevant to IFFs from countries globally and can also be resources for countries to measure their IFF:</p>
<p>The UNODC Annual Reports Questionnaire (ARQ) collects the following data, which allow to understand current scale of drug supply market:</p>

Proceeds from criminal activities are often transferred between countries to be laundered, utilized and reinvested in licit or illicit activities. IFFs can also originate from legal economic activities but become illicit when financial flows are managed or transferred illicitly; for instance, to evade taxes or to finance illegal activities. IFFs drain resources from sustainable development. Combatting IFFs is therefore a crucial component of the goal to promote peace, justice and strong institutions, as set out in Goal 16 of its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.c. Method of computation (DATA_COMP)</div></div></div><p>A bottom-up and direct measurement approach is preferred for constructing the Indicator. Bottom-up methods estimate IFFs directly in relation to the four main activities and build them up departing from the overall economic income that illicit activities generate. Direct refers to the fact that data referring to the various stages of the economic processes generating IFFs are individually measured (via surveys, administrative data or other transparent methods) and are not the exclusive result of model-based procedures. The measurement approach is in line with the &#x201C;Eurostat Handbook on the compilation of statistics on illegal economic activities in national accounts and balance of payments&#x201D;<sup><a href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8">[<del class="diffmod">6</del><ins class="diffmod">7</ins>]</a></sup> for the estimation of the contribution of illegal activities to the GDP.<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9">[<del class="diffmod">7</del><ins class="diffmod">8</ins>]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>The proposed compilation methods follow the principles developed in economic measurement frameworks such as the System of National Accounts and the Balance of Payments.</p>
<p>A two-step process was developed that aids Member States in calculating Indicator 16.4.1. The methodology has been tested in four countries. In 2021, <del class="diffdel">up to </del>twelve pilots <del class="diffmod">will</del><ins class="diffmod">have</ins> <del class="diffmod">be</del><ins class="diffmod">been</ins> launched in Africa and six in Asia and the Pacific. These will lead to the refinement and finalisation of practical guidelines for the measurement of IFFs.<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;In 2021, UNCTAD released a draft Methodological guidelines to measure tax and commercial illicit financial flows - Methods for pilot testing to support measurement exercises in these countries.</ins><sup><a href="#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10"><ins class="mod"><ins class="diffins">[9]</ins></a></sup><ins class="diffins">&nbsp;</ins></p>
<p>The methodology foresees:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A risk assessment that identifies the major and most relevant sources of IFFs in a country. This risk assessment can follow and build on existing risk assessments, e.g., the ones mandated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).<sup><a href="#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11">[<del class="diffmod">8</del><ins class="diffmod">10</ins>]</a></sup> </li>
  <li>Once the activities that generate the most important flows are identified, the flows are estimated in a disaggregated manner and then summed up for the indicator. </li>
</ol>
<p>Given the broad scope of activities generating IFFs, each type of flow needs to be treated in a separate manner. </p>
<p>As a first step in constructing the IFFs Indicator is to focus, for each IFF type, on IFFs generated during the <em><u>illicit income generation</u></em>: this refers to the set of transactions &#x2013; such as those related to international trade of illicit goods - that either directly generate illicit income for an actor during a productive or non-productive illicit activity, or that are performed in the context of the illicit production of goods and services. </p>

        <p><strong><u>Examples of income generation IFFs related to selected illegal activities</u></strong></p>
        <p><strong><u>IFFs from drug trafficking</u></strong></p>
        <p>In a drug producing country, the method to estimate IFFs derived from drug trafficking can be broadly described as follows:</p>
        <p>All drug produced in the country (P) is either consumed domestically (C), seized by law enforcement (S), exported (E) or lost (L).</p>
        <p>With that P=C+S+E+L.</p>
        <p>Countries with extended illicit drug cultivation, normally collect data on P, C, and S (losses cannot be estimated and are excluded from the calculations) and annual exports of drugs can be estimated. </p>
        <p>The value of exports can be measured by the wholesale value of the relevant drug in countries of destination of the drug produced in the country. These data can be retrieved from international data on seizures reported by other Member States (which provide information on the country of origin) and price data, which is as well reported annually through the mandated Annual Report Questionnaire (ARQ) submitted to UNODC (see <a href="about:blank">https://dataunodc.un.org/</a>)</p>
        <p>This methodology has been applied in Peru, Mexico and Afghanistan<sup><a href="#footnote-12" id="footnote-ref-12">[<del class="diffmod">9</del><ins class="diffmod">11</ins>]</a></sup> where certain portions of the income generated from drug production and trafficking are accounted for in the national accounts.</p>
        <p><strong><u>IFFs from smuggling of migrants<sup><a href="#footnote-13" id="footnote-ref-13">[<del class="diffmod">10</del><ins class="diffmod">12</ins>]</a></sup></u></strong></p>
        <p>Following the Eurostat manual &#x201C;Handbook on the compilation of statistics on illegal economic activities in national accounts and balance of payments&#x201D; four types of smuggling transactions can be distinguished, two of which create IFF:</p>
        <p><strong>Type I: Resident smugglers and resident migrants </strong>does not cover transnationality and illegal entry and does not create IFFs </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><strong>Type II: Resident smugglers and non-resident migrants</strong></p>
        <p>Constitutes an export of services and does incur an inward IFF:</p>
        <p>Export of transportation services = number of non-resident migrants smuggled by resident smugglers * prices</p>
        <p><strong>Type III: Non-resident smugglers and resident migrants</strong></p>
        <p>Estimations recorded as import of illegal services and constitute and outward IFF:</p>
        <p>Import of illegal transportation services = number of residents smuggled by non-resident smugglers * </p>
        <p>prices</p>
        <p><strong>Type IV: Non-resident smugglers and non-resident migrants</strong></p>
        <p>No estimations recorded</p>
        <p>The pilot studies found the methodology to be feasible, however, limitations on data exist, in particular on pricing.</p>

<p>At a second stage, IFFs in relation to <em><u>illicit income management</u></em> are estimated. These refer e.g., to IFFs generated when income generated from illegal activities is invested abroad (e.g., into property). To assess these flows, quantitative and qualitative information held by financial authorities, central banks and other entities concerned with money laundering and financial crimes can be used.</p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup class="footnote-number" id="footnote-8"><del class="diffmod">6</del><ins class="diffmod">7</ins></sup><p> Available here: <a href="about:blank">https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/8714610/KS-05-17-202-EN-N.pdf/eaf638df-17dc-47a1-9ab7-fe68476100ec</a> <a href="#footnote-ref-8">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class="footnote-number" id="footnote-9"><del class="diffmod">7</del><ins class="diffmod">8</ins></sup><p> With one principle difference.

<p>Data collection has not yet started. It is expected that the number of countries for which this indicator is available will gradually start increasing over time. According to inventories, over 60 per cent of countries globally already collect some data that can be used in the estimation of IFFs. However, notably efforts are planned to support countries in building their capacity to measure Indicator 16.4.1. Currently, pioneering countries are pilot testing the indicator compilation. Estimates will also be prepared in countries participating in UNCTAD and UNODC capacity building projects, carried out currently jointly with ESCAP and ECA.</p>
<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>
<p>Availability of time series would be useful for the analysis of development over time. Feasibility of constructing historical time series data will be reviewed.</p>
<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>
<p>Similar to Eurostat&#x2019;s recommendations on measuring illegal economic activities, a disaggregated measurement approach is proposed. As a minimum, disaggregation of the index by relevant types of IFFs, should be published separately for the main elements, depending on data availability: </p>
<p>&#x2022; IFFs from illicit tax and commercial practices, </p>
<p>&#x2022; IFFs from <ins class="diffins">illegal markets, </ins></p><ins class="diffins">

<p>&#x2022; resulting assets (offshore wealth / real estate etc.)</p>
