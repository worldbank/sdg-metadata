Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Definition:</ins></strong></p>
<p>The indicator tracks the number of countries reporting progress in multi stakeholder monitoring frameworks that track the implementation of development effectiveness commitments supporting the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs). </p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Concepts:</ins></strong></p>
<p>&#x201C;Multi-stakeholder development effectiveness monitoring frameworks&#x201D; that track effective development cooperation are monitoring frameworks: </p>
<p>&#x2022; whose indicators have been agreed on a voluntary basis; whose indicators measure the strength of the relationship between development actors; </p>
<p>&#x2022; where data collection and review is led by the countries themselves; and where participation in data collection and review involves relevant stakeholders representing, at minimum, the public sector, the private sector and civil society organizations.</p>
<p>The indicator takes into account the need to capture the respective roles and responsibilities of all parties involved in multi-stakeholder partnerships for development. It does so by looking at development effectiveness frameworks that are led by countries but include the participation of all relevant development partners. </p>
<p>The Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (Global Partnership) monitoring framework is an example of existing development effectiveness monitoring frameworks. There are other complementary efforts, such as the ECOSOC Development Cooperation Forum (DCF) mutual accountability survey. Emerging and future monitoring frameworks that fit the above definition, such as recent efforts to track South-South Cooperation by SEGIB, could also be considered.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.f.

<p>There is no treatment done for missing values. However, missing information is highlighted during data validation processes and stakeholders are asked to fill in these gaps. </p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">&#x2022; At regional and global levels</ins></strong></p>
<p>No imputation is done for missing values. However, missing information is highlighted during data validation processes and stakeholders are asked to fill in these gaps.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">5. Data availability and disaggregation (COVERAGE)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Data availability:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Global aggregates are available for the 2016 and 2018 Global Partnership monitoring rounds. New data will be available after 2023. </p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Time series:</ins></strong></p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Disaggregation:</ins></strong></p>
<p>The indicator presented as a global aggregate is generated through a bottom-up approach whereby data is collected at the country level and can therefore be disaggregated back at the level of countries (for both development cooperation providers and recipients) for national analysis and mutual dialogue. The data can also be further disaggregated according to individual indicators (i.e. specific dimensions of effective development cooperation) that are included within the multi-stakeholder frameworks.</p>
<p>To foster regional policy dialogue, disaggregation at the regional level is possible and encouraged. Some existing platforms are already using the evidence for regional monitoring, learning and policy discussions (e.g. NEPAD in Africa, the Asia-Pacific Development Effectiveness Facility in Asia-Pacific, the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, the UN Regional Economic Commissions). </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">6.
