Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
<p>The indicator tracks the number of countries reporting progress in multi<del class="diffmod">&nbsp;</del><ins class="diffmod">-</ins>stakeholder monitoring frameworks that track the implementation of development effectiveness commitments supporting the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs). </p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p>&#x201C;Multi-stakeholder development effectiveness monitoring frameworks&#x201D; that track effective development cooperation are monitoring frameworks: </p>
<p>&#x2022; whose indicators have been agreed on a voluntary basis; whose indicators measure the strength of the relationship between development actors; </p>
<p>&#x2022; where data collection and review <del class="diffmod">is</del><ins class="diffmod">are</ins> led by the countries themselves; and where participation in data collection and review involves relevant stakeholders representing, at minimum, the public sector, the private sector and civil society organizations.</p>
<p>The indicator takes into account the need to capture the respective roles and responsibilities of all parties involved in multi-stakeholder partnerships for development. It does so by looking at development effectiveness frameworks that are led by countries but include the participation of all relevant development partners. </p>
<p>The Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (Global Partnership) monitoring framework is an example of existing development effectiveness monitoring frameworks. There are other complementary efforts, such as the <ins class="diffins">United Nations Economic and Social Council (</ins>ECOSOC<ins class="diffins">)</ins> Development Cooperation Forum (DCF) mutual accountability survey. Emerging and future monitoring frameworks that fit the above definition, such as recent efforts to track South-South Cooperation by <ins class="diffins">the Ibero-American General Secretariat (</ins>SEGIB<ins class="diffins">)</ins>, could also be considered.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">2.c. Classifications (CLASS_SYSTEM)</div></div></div><p>For developing countries, classification is based on SDG grouping provided by the UN Statistical Office (regional classification, <ins class="diffins">Least Developed Countries (</ins>LDCs<ins class="diffins">)</ins>, <ins class="diffins">Landlocked Developing Countries (</ins>LLDCs<ins class="diffins">)</ins>, <ins class="diffins">Small Island Developing States (</ins>SIDS)<del class="diffmod">. Income classification follows the World Bank grouping (low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high income</del><ins class="diffmod">)</ins>. </p>
<p>For development partners, classification is based on SDG grouping (regional). In addition, bilateral partners can be distinguished between members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and non-members. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">3.a. Data sources (SOURCE_TYPE)</div></div></div><p>The monitoring is a voluntary and country led process. Country governments lead and coordinate data collection and validation. At country level, data are reported by relevant government entities (e.g. the Ministry of finance/budget department for national budget information) and by development partners and stakeholders. OECD and UNDP are supporting developing countries in collecting relevant data through the Global Partnership monitoring exercise, and these organisations lead data aggregation and quality assurance at the global level. </p>
<p>Complementarily, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs has been conducting a regular survey for the Development Cooperation Forum, in cooperation with UNDP, to identify national progress in mutual accountability and transparency. Survey results are assessed in comprehensive studies, informing global monitoring and providing practical suggestions for improving development results. Synergies with the measurement of indicator 7 of the Global Partnership monitoring framework are being used. Other complementary sources of data (i.e. additional multi-<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del>stakeholder frameworks) may be incorporated in the future to provide a broader picture of progress made by countries towards development effectiveness in support of SDG implementation. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">3.b.

<p>The data is then reviewed by headquarters<del class="diffmod">&nbsp;</del><ins class="diffmod">/</ins>offices of providers of development co-operation.</p>
<p>(iii) No adjustments are made to submitted data, given that the validation process needs to stay at country level.

Method of computation (DATA_COMP)</div></div></div><p>To reflect the universal nature of target 17.16<ins class="diffins">,</ins> this indicator is presented as the global aggregate number of countries reporting progress. For any country reporting towards one (or more) multi-stakeholder development effectiveness framework(s), the country is considered to be reporting progress when, for the year of reference, the number of indicators within the framework(s) that show a positive trend is greater than the number of indicators that show a negative trend.</p>
<p><u>Countries providing development co-operation funding</u> and reporting in multi-stakeholder development effectiveness monitoring frameworks are assessed against the following elements: </p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Aligning to country-defined development objectives: </em>Percentage of new development interventions whose objectives are drawn from country-led results frameworks.</li>
  <li><em>Using country-led results frameworks: </em>Percentage of results indicators contained in new development interventions which are drawn from country-owned results frameworks.</li>
  <li><em>Using national monitoring and statistical systems: </em>Percentage of results indicators in new development interventions which will be monitored using government sources and monitoring systems.</li>
  <li><em>Using national evaluation systems: </em>Percentage of new interventions that plan a final evaluation with country government involvement.</li>
  <li><em>Transparency of development cooperation</em>: Public availability of information on development cooperation according to international reporting standards. </li>
  <li><em>Annual predictability of development cooperation</em>: Proportion of development cooperation disbursed as development partners had scheduled at the beginning of the year. </li>
  <li><em>Medium-term predictability of development cooperation: </em>forward-looking spending plans made available to the partner government (indicative annual amounts of development cooperation support to be provided over the one-to-three years). </li>
  <li><em>Development cooperation on budgets subject to parliamentary oversight: </em>share<em> </em>of development cooperation funds planned to/for the country&#x2019;s public sector that are recorded in the annual budget submitted for legislative approval.</li>
  <li><em>Development cooperation delivered through country systems: </em>Proportion of development cooperation disbursed to a given country according to national regulations and systems for public financial management (i.e. budgeting, financial reporting, auditing) and procurement.</li>
  <li><em>Untied aid: </em>Proportion of development cooperation that is untied.<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[1]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p><u>Countries receiving development cooperation funding</u> and reporting in multi-stakeholder development effectiveness monitoring frameworks are assessed against the following elements:<u> </u></p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Leading in setting up national priorities: </em>Countries strengthen their<em> </em>national results frameworks.</li>
  <li><em>Creating an enabling environment for civil society organisations: </em>Civil society organizations operate within an environment that maximises their engagement in and contribution to development.</li>
  <li><em>Promoting private sector engagement and contribution to development: </em>Quality of public-private dialogue<ins class="diffins">.</ins> </li>
  <li><em>Recording development cooperation on budgets subject to parliamentary oversight</em>: Share of development cooperation funds planned to/for the country&#x2019;s public sector that are recorded in the annual budget submitted for legislative approval.</li>
  <li><em>Strengthening mutual accountability: </em>Mutual accountability among development actors is strengthened through inclusive reviews.</li>
  <li><em>Strengthening gender equality and women&#x2019;s empowerment: </em>Existence of transparent government systems to track public allocations for gender equality and women&#x2019;s empowerment. </li>
  <li><em>Strengthening domestic institutions: </em>Quality of the country&#x2019;s budgetary and public financial management.</li>
</ol>
<p>Countries providing and receiving development cooperation funding are invited to select whether they would like to report against provider-specific commitments, against recipient-specific commitments, or against both sets of commitments.</p>
<p>For countries reporting both as providers and recipients of development cooperation, progress is calculated separately based on the respective set of indicators described above. Disaggregated results will show the detailed performance in each category. For the ultimate count of the number of countries making progress, dual countries are accounted as making progress if progress is made as recipient <strong>or</strong> as provider of development cooperation. </p>
<p>The baseline for assessing progress is the latest measurement available for each specific <del class="diffmod">country.</del><ins class="diffmod">count</ins> When no baseline exists for a country, the first measurement available for an indicator constitutes the baseline for future measurements of progress.</p>
<p>When a country meets and sustains all targets for the indicators it reports on (i.e. it is logically impossible to make further progress) it is considered as &#x201C;making progress&#x201D;. </p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup class="footnote-number" id="footnote-2">1</sup><p> Estimates currently available for countries that are members of the OECD Development Assistance Committee. <ins class="diffins">Data can be found at https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TABLE7B </ins><a href="#footnote-ref-2">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.h.

<p>Global aggregates are available for the 2016 and 2018 Global Partnership monitoring rounds. New data will be available after 2023. </p>
<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Data for countries have been compiled in 2016 and 2018. From 2023, data will be available on a rolling basis with all countries encouraged to report at least once within a four-year cycle.</ins></p>
<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>
<p>The indicator presented as a global aggregate is generated through a bottom-up approach whereby data is collected at the country level and can therefore be disaggregated back at the level of countries (for both development cooperation providers and recipients) for national analysis and mutual dialogue. The data can also be further disaggregated according to individual indicators (i.e. specific dimensions of effective development cooperation) that are included within the multi-stakeholder frameworks.</p>
<p>To foster regional policy dialogue, disaggregation at the regional level is possible and encouraged. Some existing platforms are already using the evidence for regional monitoring, learning and policy discussions (e.g. NEPAD in Africa, the Asia-Pacific Development Effectiveness Facility in Asia-Pacific, the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, the UN Regional Economic Commissions). </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">6.
