Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Definitions:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (here after, CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions per unit of value added is an indicator computed as ratio between CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuel combustion and the value added of associated economic activities. The indicator can be computed for the whole economy (total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions/GDP) or for specific sectors, notably the manufacturing sector (CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from manufacturing industries per manufacturing value added (MVA). </p>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per unit of GDP are expressed in kilogrammes of CO<sub>2</sub> per unit of purchasing power parity GDP in constant 2017 USD. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from manufacturing industries per unit of MVA are measured in kilogrammes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per unit of MVA in constant 2015 USD.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Concepts:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for an economy are estimated based on energy consumption data for all sectors.</p>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from manufacturing are based on energy data collected across the following subsectors (energy used for transport by industry is not included here but reported under transport):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Iron and steel industry [ISIC Group 241 and Class 2431];</li>
  <li>Chemical and petrochemical industry [ISIC Divisions 20 and 21] excluding petrochemical feedstocks;</li>
  <li>Non-ferrous metals basic industries [ISIC Group 242 and Class 2432];</li>
  <li>Non-metallic minerals such as glass, ceramic, cement, etc. [ISIC Division 23];</li>
  <li>Transport equipment [ISIC Divisions 29 and 30];</li>
  <li>Machinery comprises fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment other than transport equipment [ISIC Divisions 25 to 28];</li>
  <li>Food and tobacco [ISIC Divisions 10 to 12];</li>
  <li>Paper, pulp and printing [ISIC Divisions 17 and 18];</li>
  <li>Wood and wood products (other than pulp and paper) [ISIC Division 16];</li>
  <li>Textile and leather [ISIC Divisions 13 to 15];</li>
  <li>Non-specified (any manufacturing industry not included above) [ISIC Divisions 22, 31 and 32].</li>
</ul>
<p>Energy data are collected at a country level, based on internationally agreed standards (UN International Recommendations on Energy Statistics (IRES)). CO<sub>2</sub> emissions need to be estimated based on energy data and on internationally agreed methodologies (2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories). </p>
<p>The IEA collects national energy data, according to internationally agreed energy statistics definitions and estimates CO<sub>2</sub> emissions based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories&#x2019; Tier 1 methodology, producing internationally comparable CO<sub>2</sub> emissions data for over 150 countries and regions.</p>
<p>The gross value added measures the contribution to the economy of each individual producer, industry or sector in a country. The gross value added generated by any unit engaged in production activity can be calculated as the residual of the units&#x2019; total output less intermediate consumption, goods and services used up in the process of producing the output, or as the sum of the factor incomes generated by the production process (System of National Accounts 2008). Manufacturing refers to industries belonging to the sector C defined by International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 4, or D defined by ISIC Revision 3.</p>
<p>GDP represents the sum of gross value added from all institutional units resident in the economy. For the purpose on comparability over time and across countries, GDP based on purchasing power parity (PPP) is used to calculate the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions intensity of the economy. MVA is estimated in terms of constant prices in USD. The current series are given at constant prices of 2015.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.f. Treatment of missing values (i) at country level and (ii) at regional level (IMPUTATION)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">&#x2022; At country level</ins></strong></p>
<p>Providing all the elements of energy balance, underlying the IEA CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions estimations has often required estimations. Estimations have been generally made after consultation with national statistical offices, energy companies, utilities and national energy experts.</p>
<p>Boudt, Todorov, Upadhyaya (2009): Nowcasting manufacturing value added for cross-country comparison; Statistical Journal of IAOS</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">&#x2022; At regional and global levels</ins></strong></p>
<p>In the compilation of the IEA energy balances which are the underlying for estimating the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and in addition to estimates at a country level, adjustments addressing differences in definitions alongside estimations for informal and/or confidential trade, production or stock changes of energy products are sometimes required to complete major aggregates, when key statistics are missing. Such estimations and adjustments implemented by IEA have been generally made after consultation with national statistical offices, energy companies, utilities and national energy experts.</p>
<p>No imputation is provided if values are missing for the entire country or the region. It can only be projected from the data reported for previous years.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">5. Data availability and disaggregation (COVERAGE)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Data availability:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Data are available for more than 140 countries.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Time series:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Data for this indicator are available as of 2000 in the UN Global SDG Database, but longer time series are available in the IEA database (IEA CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuel combustion) and the UNIDO MVA database.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Disaggregation:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Data can be presented for national totals, for the manufacturing sector, and by industrial subsector.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">6. Comparability/deviation from international standards (COMPARABILITY)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Sources of discrepancies:</ins></strong></p>
<p>The IEA CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuel combustion, used for calculating these indicators, is a global database obtained following harmonised definitions and comparable methodologies across countries. However, it does not represent an official source for national GHG inventories submissions by the countries.</p>
<p>Difference may arise due to different sources of official energy data, dissimilarities in the underlying methodologies, adjustments and estimations. More information on these sources of differences is available in the IEA database documentation file available at:</p>
<p><a href="http://wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/Worldco2_Documentation.pdf">wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/Worldco2_Documentation.pdf</a></p>
<p>Additionally, difference may arise if the country has not submitted energy consumption data adequately dis-aggregated by sector or by energy sources and/or due to conversion of value data into USD.</p></div>
