Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Concepts and definitions:</ins></strong></p>
<p>The following key concepts were defined to support the indicator in the context of poverty eradication. </p>
<p><strong>Basic Services</strong> refer to public service provision systems that meet human basic needs including drinking water, sanitation, hygiene, energy, mobility, waste collection, health care, education and information technologies. The basis cervices indicator will be therefore based on 9 components. These components are captured in various standalone indicators of the SDGs, which means that the concepts and definitions of SDG indicator 1.4.1 will be derived from or are the same as those of these specific SDG indicators. </p>
<p><strong>Access to basic services</strong> implies that sufficient and affordable service is reliably available with adequate quality.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Access to Basic Drinking Water Services</strong> refers to the use of drinking water from an improved source that is available with a collection time of not more than 30 minutes for a round trip, including queuing. Improved sources include: piped water, boreholes or tube wells, protected dug wells, protected springs, and packaged or delivered water. This definition is based on the JMP drinking water ladder and is the foundation for SDG indicator 6.1.1 - <em>Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services.</em> </li>
  <li><strong>Access to Basic Sanitation Services</strong> refers to the use of improved facilities that are not shared with other households. Improved facilities include: flush/pour flush to piped sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines; ventilated improved pit latrines, composting toilets or pit latrines with slabs. This definition is based on the JMP sanitation ladder and is the foundation for SDG indicator 6.2.1 - <em>Proportion of population using (a) safely managed sanitation services and (b) a hand-washing facility with soap and water.</em> </li>
  <li><strong>Access to Basic Hygiene Facilities</strong> refers to availability of a handwashing facility on premises with soap and water. Handwashing facilities may be fixed or mobile and include a sink with tap water, buckets with taps, tippy-taps, and jugs or basins designated for handwashing. Soap includes bar soap, liquid soap, powder detergent, and soapy water but does not include ash, soil, sand or other handwashing agents. This definition is based on the JMP hygiene ladder and is the foundation for SDG indicator 6.2.1 - <em>Proportion of population using (a) safely managed sanitation services and (b) a hand-washing facility with soap and water.</em> </li>
</ol>
<p>For many low and middle-income countries, achieving universal access to basic drinking water, sanitation and hygiene remains a high priority, which will help them achieve access to &#x2018;safely managed services&#x2019;, the target for SDGs 6.1 and 6.2. </p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Access to clean fuels and technology</strong> refers to use of fuels and technology that are defined by the emission rate targets and specific fuel recommendations (i.e. against unprocessed coal and kerosene) included in the normative guidance WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: household fuel combustion. This component will be captured through SDG 7.1.2 - <em>Percentage of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology.</em></li>
  <li><strong>Access to Basic Mobility </strong>refers to having convenient access to transport in a rural context (SDG 9.1.1) or having convenient access to public transport in an urban context (SDG 11.2.1). </li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Access to mobility rural context</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To eradicate poverty, communities need to be connected to socio-economic opportunities by roads that are passable all season and attract reliable and affordable public transport services. In many areas, safe footpaths, footbridges and waterways may be required in conjunction with, or as an alternative, to roads. For reasons of simplification, specific emphasis was given to roads in this definition (based on the Rural Access Index - RAI - percentage of the population &lt;2km from an all-season road (equivalent to a walk of 20-25 mins)<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[1]</a></sup></sup>)<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[2]</a></sup></sup> since road transport reflects accessibility for the great majority of people in rural contexts. In those situations where another mode, such as water transport is dominant the definition will be modified and contextualized to reflect and capture those aspects. Access to mobility has shown some of the largest impacts on poverty reduction and has a strong correlation to educational, economic and health outcomes (&#x201C;transport as an enabler&#x201D;). </p>
<p>RAI is the most widely accepted metric for tracking access to transport in rural areas and has been included in the SDGs as SDG indicator 9.1.1 - <em>Proportion of the rural population who live within 2 km of an all-season road.</em> This component will be therefore captured through SDG 9.1.1.</p>
<p>The existing RAI methodology relies on household level survey data &#x2013; however, is currently being revised into a GIS-based index that exploits advances in digital technology with the aim to create a more accurate and cost-effective tool. </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Access to mobility urban context</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The urban context of access to transport is measured utilizing the methodology of SDG 11.2.1 &#x2013;<em>Proportion of the population that has convenient access to public transport by sex, age and persons with disabilities</em>. </p>
<p>The metadata methodology is available (UN-Habitat being the custodian agency) and uses a combination of spatial and qualitative analysis. A 500 m buffer around each public transport stop is used and overlaid with socio-demographic data &#x2013; in order to identify the population served. We know that measuring spatial access is not sufficient and does not address the temporal dimension associated with the availability of public transport. Complementary to the above, other parameters of tracking the transport target related to street density/ no. of intersections, affordability, or quality in terms of safety, travel time, universal access, are all tracked. </p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Access to Basic Waste Collection Services </strong>refers to the access that the population have to a reliable waste collection service, including both formal municipal and informal sector services. This is connected to and will be captured through SDG Indicator 11.6.1 - <em><u>Proportion of municipal solid waste collected and managed in controlled facilities out of total municipal waste generated, by cities</u></em>. A &#x2018;collection service&#x2019; may be &#x2018;door to door&#x2019; or by deposit into a community container. &#x2018;Collection&#x2019; includes collection for recycling as well as for treatment and disposal (so includes e.g. collection of recyclables by itinerant waste buyers). &#x2018;Reliable&#x2019; means regular - frequency will depend on local conditions and on any pre-separation of the waste. For example, both mixed waste and organic waste are often collected daily in tropical climates for public health reasons, and generally at least weekly; source-separated dry recyclables may be collected less frequently.</li>
  <li><strong>Access to Basic Health Care Services</strong> refers to access to services that cover in and out-of-area emergency services, inpatient hospital and physician care, outpatient medical services, laboratory and radiology services, and preventive health services. Basic health care services also extend to access to limited treatment of mental illness and substance abuse in accordance with minimum standards prescribed by local and national ministries of health. This is connected to and will be measured through SDG indicator 3.8.1 &#x2013; <em>Coverage of essential health services</em>.</li>
  <li>Access<strong> to Basic Education</strong> refers to access to education services that provides all learners with capabilities they require to become economically productive, develop sustainable livelihoods, contribute to peaceful and democratic societies and enhance individual well-being. This is connected to and will be captured through SDG 4.1.1 - <em>Proportion of children and young people (a) in grades 2/3; (b) at the end of primary; and (c) at the end of lower secondary achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics, by sex</em>. </li>
  <li><strong>Access to Basic Information Services</strong> refers to having a broadband internet access. Broadband is defined as technologies that deliver advertised download speeds of at least 256 kbit/s. Connecting the 50% of the world that is still offline means, in large part, ensuring that everyone, everywhere is able to access an internet that is affordable. The main types of broadband services are: 1) Fixed (wired) broadband network, such as DSL, cable modem, high speed leased lines, fibre to- the-home/building, powerline and other fixed (wired) broadband; 2) Terrestrial fixed (wireless) broadband network, such as WiMAX, fixed CDMA; 3) Satellite broadband network (via a satellite connection); 4) Mobile broadband network (at least 3G, e.g. UMTS) via a handset and 5) Mobile broadband network (at least 3G, e.g. UMTS) via a card (e.g. integrated SIM card in a computer) or USB modem. This is connected to and will be captured through SDG 9.c.1 - <em>Proportion of population covered by a mobile network, by technology</em>.</li>

<p>Data for a large set of sub-indicators such as water and sanitation, energy, information are readily available and already included in different international household survey framework. Refinement of definitions of different types of basic services and inclusion of the newly developed survey items in the existing household survey was completed. Data compilation has shown that already more than 100 countries have data at the national level.</p>
