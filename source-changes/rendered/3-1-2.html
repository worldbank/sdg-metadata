Comment and limitations (REC_USE_LIM)</div></div></div><p>Births attended by skilled health personnel is an indicator of health care utilization. It is a measure of the health system&#x2019;s functioning and potential to provide adequate coverage for childbirth. On its own, however, this indicator does not provide insight into the availability or accessibility of services, for example in cases where emergency care <del class="diffmod">if</del><ins class="diffmod">is</ins> needed. Neither does this indicator capture the quality of care received.</p>
<p>Data collection and data interpretation in many countries is challenged by lack of guidelines, standardization of professional titles and functions of the health care provider, and in some countries by task-shifting. In addition, many countries have found that there are large gaps between international standards and the competencies of existing <del class="diffdel">of </del>health care professionals providing childbirth care.

Data availability and disaggregation (COVERAGE)</div></div></div><p><strong>Data availability: </strong></p>
<p>Data are available for over 170 countries. </p>
<p>The lag between the reference year and actual production of data series depends on the availability of the household survey for each country. </p>

<p><strong>Disaggregation: </strong></p>
<p>For this indicator, when data are reported from household surveys, disaggregation is available for various socio-economic characteristics including age of the mother, residence (urban/rural), household wealth (quintiles), education level of the mother, maternal age, geographic regions. When data are reported from administrative sources, disaggregation is more limited and tend to include only residence. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">6. Comparability/deviation from international standards (COMPARABILITY)</div></div></div><p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong> </p>
<p>Discrepancies are possible if there are national figures compiled at the health facility level. These would differ from the global figures, which are typically based on survey data collected at the household level. </p>
<p>In terms of survey data, some survey reports may present a total percentage of births attended by a skilled health professional that does not conform to the SDG definition (e.g., total includes provider that is not considered skilled, such as a community health worker). In that case, the proportion of childbirths by a physician, nurse, or a midwife are totalled, consulted with the country and included in the global database as the SDG estimate. </p>
<p>In some countries where the indicator on skilled health personnel is not actively reported, birth in a health facility (institutional births) is used as a proxy indicator. This is frequent in countries in the Latin America region, in European and Central Asian regions, where the proportion of births attended by health professionals is very high. Nonetheless, it should be noted that institutional births may underestimate the percentage of births assisted by skilled health professionals, particularly in cases were home births -<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;</ins>assisted by skilled health professionals -<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;</ins>are prevalent. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">7.
