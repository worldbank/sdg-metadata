<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p>According to the UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (1993), violence against women is &#x201C;Any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual<ins class="diffins">,</ins> or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family [&#x2026;]&#x201D;. See here for <ins class="diffins">the </ins>full definition: <a href="https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/48/104">https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/48/104</a> </p>
<p>Intimate partner violence<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;(IPV)</ins> against women includes any abuse perpetrated by a current or former partner within the context of marriage, cohabitation<ins class="diffins">,</ins> or any other formal or informal union.</p>
<p>The <u>different forms of violence</u> included in the indicator are defined as follows: </p>
<p>1. Physical violence consists of acts aimed at physically hurting the victim and include, but are not limited to<del class="diffdel">,</del> acts like pushing, grabbing, twisting the arm, pulling hair, slapping, kicking, biting<del class="diffmod">&nbsp;or</del><ins class="diffmod">,</ins> hitting with a fist or object, trying to strangle or suffocate, burning or scalding on purpose, or threatening or attacking with some sort of weapon, gun or knife. </p>
<p>2. Sexual violence is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual <del class="diffmod">behavior</del><ins class="diffmod">behaviour</ins> that is imposed on someone, whether by use of physical force, intimidation<ins class="diffins">,</ins> or coercion. It includes acts of abusive sexual contact, forced sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts (intercourse) without consent (rape or attempted rape), non-contact acts such as being forced to watch or participate in pornography, etc. In intimate partner relationships, sexual violence is commonly operationally defined in surveys as<del class="diffdel">:</del> being physically forced to have sexual intercourse, having sexual intercourse out of fear for what the partner might do or through coercion, and/or being forced to <del class="diffmod">so</del><ins class="diffmod">do</ins> something sexual that the woman considers humiliating or degrading.</p>
<p>3. Psychological violence consists of any act that induces fear or emotional distress<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del>. It includes a range of <del class="diffmod">behaviors</del><ins class="diffmod">behaviours</ins> that encompass acts of emotional abuse such as being frequently humiliated in public, intimidated or having things you care for destroyed, etc. These often coexist with acts of physical and sexual violence by intimate partners. In addition, surveys often measure controlling behaviours (e.g., being kept from seeing family or friends, or from seeking health care without permission). These are also considered acts of psychological abuse<ins class="diffins">, although usually measured separately. .</ins> </p>

Rationale (RATIONALE)</div></div></div><p>Intimate partner violence is <ins class="diffins">one of </ins>the most common <del class="diffmod">form</del><ins class="diffmod">forms</ins> of violence that women face globally. Given prevailing social norms that sanction male dominance over women, male violence towards their female intimate partners is often perceived as an ordinary/normal element of relationships in the context of marriage or other unions<ins class="diffins">/relationships</ins>. Violence against women is an extreme manifestation of gender inequality<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;and discrimination</ins>.</p>

Comment and limitations (REC_USE_LIM)</div></div></div><p><u>Comparability:</u></p>
<p>The availability of comparable data remains a challenge in this area as many data collection efforts have relied on different survey methodologies, <ins class="diffins">or </ins>used different definitions of partner or spousal violence <del class="diffdel">e.g. definitions based on severity of acts or type of violence) </del>and recall periods (<del class="diffdel">i.</del>e.<del class="diffmod">&nbsp;lifetime versus past year/12 months &#x2013; and</del><ins class="diffmod">g.,</ins> different definitions of &#x201C;lifetime&#x201D;)<del class="diffmod">;</del><ins class="diffmod">. Many survey measures and/or reports</ins> lack<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;of</del> disaggregation by different forms of intimate partner violence (physical, sexual, psychological)<ins class="diffins">.</ins> <del class="diffmod">and</del><ins class="diffmod">There</ins> <del class="diffmod">by</del><ins class="diffmod">are</ins> <del class="diffmod">different</del><ins class="diffmod">often</ins> <del class="diffmod">forms</del><ins class="diffmod">differences</ins> <del class="diffmod">of violence and different</del><ins class="diffmod">in</ins> survey question formulations<del class="diffdel">,</del> <del class="diffmod">used diverse age groups, </del><ins class="diffmod">and/</ins>or<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;used different</del> denominators <del class="diffdel">(</del>e.g. all women [various age ranges], or only ever-married/partnered or currently married/partnered women). <ins class="diffins">There is also heterogeneity in age groups sampled and reported on. </ins>The quality of interviewer training also likely varies<ins class="diffins">,</ins> although this is difficult to quantify. Willingness to discuss experiences of violence and understanding of relevant concepts may also differ according to how the survey is implemented<del class="diffdel">,</del> and the <ins class="diffins">social/</ins>cultural context<ins class="diffins">,</ins> and this can affect reported prevalence levels.</p>
<p>Given the wide variations in methodologies, measurement<ins class="diffins">,</ins> and quality across studies from different countries<ins class="diffins">,</ins> statistically adjusted estimates are currently needed to ensure comparability across countries and regions. However, generating estimates <del class="diffmod">are</del><ins class="diffmod">is</ins> an interim solution and <del class="diffdel">it is important for </del>individual countries<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;need</ins> to collect robust, internationally comparable, high-quality data that reflect the relevant <del class="diffmod">socioeconomic</del><ins class="diffmod">socio-economic</ins>, political and cultural risk<ins class="diffins">,</ins> and protective factors associated with the prevalence of violence against women <del class="diffmod">in order</del><ins class="diffmod">(VAW)</ins> to inform appropriate policy responses and programmatic decision-making. As more countries adopt international recommendations and guidelines, including the key elements described in this document, the need for adjustments for estimates for global monitoring will be greatly reduced.</p>
<p><u>Regularity of data production:</u></p>
<p>Since 2000, only about 78 countries have conducted more than one survey on <del class="diffmod">violence against women</del><ins class="diffmod">VAW</ins>. Obtaining data on <del class="diffmod">violence against women</del><ins class="diffmod">VAW</ins> is a costly and time-consuming exercise, whether they are obtained through stand-alone dedicated surveys or <del class="diffdel">through </del>modules in other surveys. Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), the main source of data for <ins class="diffins">low- and lower-middle Income Countries (</ins>LMICs<ins class="diffins">)</ins>, are conducted every 5 years or so and dedicated surveys, if repeated, are conducted usually with less periodicity than this. Monitoring this indicator with certain periodicity may be a challenge if sustained capacities are not built and financial resources are not available for regular surveys. At the same time prevalence is unlikely to change from year to year so<ins class="diffins">, depending on resources,</ins> every 3-5 years is recommended.</p>
<p><u>Feasibility:</u></p>
<p>This indicator calls for global reporting on three types of intimate partner violence<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;(IPV)</ins>: physical, sexual, and psychological. While there is global consensus on how physical and sexual <del class="diffmod">intimate partner violence</del><ins class="diffmod">IPV</ins> are generally defined and measured, psychological partner violence&#x2014;<del class="diffmod">which</del><ins class="diffmod">is</ins> <del class="diffmod">may be conceptualised</del><ins class="diffmod">conceptualized</ins> differently across cultures and in different contexts. This indicator therefore currently reports on physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence only. Efforts are underway by custodian agencies to develop a global standard for measuring and reporting <del class="diffdel">on </del>psychological <del class="diffmod">intimate partner violence</del><ins class="diffmod">IPV</ins>. This will enable reporting on the three stipulated types of partner violence in the future. </p>
<p>Similarly, this indicator calls for global reporting of violence <del class="diffdel">experienced by </del>ever-partnered women aged 15 years and above<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;have been subjected to</ins>. <del class="diffmod">A majority of</del><ins class="diffmod">Most</ins> data come from DHS, which typically sample only women aged 15-49, and there is a lack of consistency in the age range of sample populations across other country surveys. For those surveys that interview a sample of women from a different age group, the prevalence for the 15-49 age group is often published or can be calculated from available data. The global indicator therefore currently reports on both violence <del class="diffdel">experienced by </del>ever-partnered women 15-49 years of age and 15 years and older<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;have been subjected to</ins>. Given the existing limited<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;data</ins> availability on violence against women aged 50 years and older, efforts are underway by the custodian agencies to improve the measurement and encourage increased availability of data <del class="diffmod">on violence against</del><ins class="diffmod">for</ins> women <del class="diffmod">aged</del><ins class="diffmod">of</ins> <del class="diffmod">50</del><ins class="diffmod">this</ins> <del class="diffmod">years</del><ins class="diffmod">age</ins> <del class="diffmod">and older</del><ins class="diffmod">group</ins>.
