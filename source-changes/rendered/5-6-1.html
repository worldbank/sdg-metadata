<p>Proportion of women aged 15-49 years (married or in union) who make their own decision on all three selected areas i.e. decide on their own health care; decide on use of contraception; and can say no to sexual intercourse with their husband or partner if they do not want. Only women who provide a &#x201C;yes&#x201D; answer to all three components are considered as women who make their own decisions regarding sexual and reproductive health. A union involves a man and a woman regularly cohabiting in a marriage-like relationship.</p>
<p>Women&#x2019;s autonomy in decision-making and exercise of their reproductive rights is assessed from responses to the following three questions:</p>
<p>1. Who usually makes decisions about health care for yourself?</p>
<p>&#x2013; RESPONDENT </p>
<p>&#x2013; HUSBAND/PARTNER</p>
<p>&#x2013; RESPONDENT AND HUSBAND/PARTNER JOINTLY</p>
<p>&#x2013; SOMEONE ELSE</p>
<p>&#x2013; OTHER SPECIFY </p>
<p>2. Who usually makes the decision on whether or not you should use contraception? </p>
<p>&#x2013; RESPONDENT </p>
<p>&#x2013; HUSBAND/PARTNER </p>
<p>&#x2013; RESPONDENT AND HUSBAND/PARTNER JOINTLY</p>
<p>&#x2013; SOMEONE ELSE</p>
<p>&#x2013; OTHER SPECIFY</p>
<p>3. Can you say no to your husband/partner if you do not want to have sexual intercourse?</p>
<p>&#x2013; YES </p>
<p>&#x2013; NO </p>
<p>&#x2013; DEPENDS/NOT SURE</p>
<p>A woman is considered to have autonomy in reproductive health decision making and to be empowered to exercise their reproductive rights if they (1) decide on health care for themselves, either alone or jointly with their husbands or partners, (2) decide on use or non-use of contraception, either alone or jointly with their husbands or partners; and (3) can say no to sex with their husband/partner if they do not want to.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.f. Treatment of missing values (i) at country level and (ii) at regional level (IMPUTATION)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">&#x2022; At country level</ins></strong></p>
<p>No attempt from UNFPA to provide and publish estimates for individual countries or areas when country or area data are not available. </p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">&#x2022; At regional and global levels</ins></strong></p>
<p>Regional aggregates are based on countries where data are available within the region. They should not be treated as country-level estimates for countries with missing values within the region.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">5. Data availability and disaggregation (COVERAGE)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Data availability:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Currently, a total of 64 countries have at least one survey with data on all the 3 questions above which are necessary for calculating Indicator 5.6.1. The 64 countries with data are distributed as follows: </p>
<p>&#x2022; Central Asia and Southern Asia (7)</p>
<p>&#x2022; Eastern Asia and South-eastern Asia (5) </p>
<p>&#x2022; Northern America and Europe (5)</p>
<p>&#x2022; Western Asia and Northern Africa (3)</p>
<p>&#x2022; Latin America and the Caribbean (7) </p>
<p>&#x2022; Sub-Saharan Africa (36)</p>
<p>Several other countries have only one or two of the three questions needed to calculate Indicator 5.6.1. UNFPA engages with major international and regional survey programmes, as well as national and international organizations and agencies to incorporate the questions in relevant household surveys with a view to covering all countries on a global scale. </p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Time series:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Currently data comes from household surveys which have three to five- year cycles.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Disaggregation:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Based on available household survey data, disaggregation is possible by age, geographic location, place of residence, education, and wealth quintile.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">6.
