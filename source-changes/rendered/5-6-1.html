Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
<p>Proportion of women aged 15-49 years (married or in union) who make their own decision on all three selected areas i.e. decide on their own health care; decide on use of contraception; and can say no to sexual intercourse with their husband or partner if they do not want. Only women who provide a &#x201C;yes&#x201D; answer to all three components are considered as women who make their own decisions regarding sexual and reproductive health. A union involves a man and a woman regularly cohabiting in a marriage-like relationship.</p>
<p>Women&#x2019;s autonomy in decision-making and exercise of their reproductive rights is assessed from responses to the following three questions:</p>
<p>1. Who usually makes decisions about health care for yourself?</p>
<p>&#x2013; RESPONDENT </p>
<p>&#x2013; HUSBAND/PARTNER</p>
<p>&#x2013; RESPONDENT AND HUSBAND/PARTNER JOINTLY</p>
<p>&#x2013; SOMEONE ELSE</p>
<p>&#x2013; OTHER<ins class="diffins">,</ins> SPECIFY </p>
<p>2. Who usually makes the decision on whether or not you should use contraception? </p>
<p>&#x2013; RESPONDENT </p>
<p>&#x2013; HUSBAND/PARTNER </p>
<p>&#x2013; RESPONDENT AND HUSBAND/PARTNER JOINTLY</p>
<p>&#x2013; SOMEONE ELSE</p>
<p>&#x2013; OTHER<ins class="diffins">,</ins> SPECIFY</p>
<p>3. Can you say no to your husband/partner if you do not want to have sexual intercourse?</p>
<p>&#x2013; YES </p>
<p>&#x2013; NO </p>
<p>&#x2013; DEPENDS/NOT SURE</p>
<p>A woman is considered to have autonomy in reproductive health decision making and to be empowered to exercise their reproductive rights if they (1) decide on health care for themselves, either alone or jointly with their husbands or partners, (2) decide on use or non-use of contraception, either alone or jointly with their husbands or partners; and (3) can say no to sex with their husband/partner if they do not want to.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">2.b.

It moved away from a focus on reaching specific demographic targets to a focus on the needs, aspirations and rights of individual women and men. The Programme of Action asserted that everyone counts, that the true focus of development policy must be the improvement of individual lives and the measure of progress should be the extent to which we address inequalities.

</del><p>Data for SDG indicator 5.6.1 may be collected through existing <del class="diffmod">county</del><ins class="diffmod">country</ins>-specific surveys. For existing national household surveys, it must be ascertained that the sampling design does not systematically exclude subgroups of the population that are important to SDG 5.6.1, specifically, women of reproductive age (15-49) that are currently married or in <ins class="diffins">a </ins>union. Surveys that cover only certain population subgroups, such as women who speak the dominant language or women from the main ethnic group, may exclude the experiences of <del class="diffmod">a large number of</del><ins class="diffmod">many</ins> women. Data on the ethnicity and religion of the survey participants should be collected whenever available. The survey should have a large sample size (usually between 5,000 and 30,000 households), be nationally<del class="diffmod">-</del><ins class="diffmod">&nbsp;</ins>representative, and<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;be</ins> representative, at least, at one administrative level below the national level.</p>
<p>Surveys on unrelated topics may not be good candidates for the incorporation of the SDG 5.6.1 questions. The sensitivity of the topics addressed in health surveys<del class="diffdel">, in particular,</del> those examining women&#x2019;s health, <del class="diffmod">making</del><ins class="diffmod">makes</ins> them a feasible instrument for incorporating questions on women&#x2019;s experience of decision making in <del class="diffmod">sex</del><ins class="diffmod">health</ins> <del class="diffmod">relations</del><ins class="diffmod">care</ins>, use of <del class="diffmod">contraceptive</del><ins class="diffmod">contraceptives</ins>, and <del class="diffmod">health</del><ins class="diffmod">sexual</ins> <del class="diffmod">care</del><ins class="diffmod">relations</ins> for themselves.</p>

Institutional mandate (INST_MANDATE)</div></div></div><p>The mandate of UNFPA, as established by the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in 1973 and reaffirmed in 1993, is (1) to build the knowledge and the capacity to respond to needs in population and family planning; (2) to promote awareness in both developed and developing countries of population problems and possible strategies to deal with these problems; (3) to assist their population problems in the forms and means best suited to the individual countries&apos; needs; (4) to assume a leading role in the United Nations system in promoting population programmes, and to coordinate projects supported by the Fund.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), held in Cairo in 1994, these broad ideas were elaborated to emphasize the gender and human rights dimensions of population. UNFPA was given the lead in helping countries carry out the Programme of Action adopted by 179 governments at the Cairo Conference. In 2010, the United Nations General Assembly extended the ICPD beyond 2014, which was <ins class="diffins">the </ins>original end date for the 20-year Programme of Action.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.a. Rationale (RATIONALE)</div></div></div><p>Women&#x2019;s and girls&#x2019; autonomy in decision<del class="diffmod">&nbsp;</del><ins class="diffmod">-</ins>making about sexual and reproductive health services, contraceptive use<ins class="diffins">,</ins> and consensual sexual relations is key to their empowerment and the <del class="diffmod">full</del><ins class="diffmod">complete</ins> exercise of their reproductive rights. </p>
<p>Women who make their own decision regarding seeking healthcare for themselves are considered empowered to exercise their reproductive rights.</p>
<p>Regarding decision-making on<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;the</ins> use of contraception, a clearer understanding of women empowerment is obtained by looking at the indicator from the perspective of decisions being made &#x201C;mainly by the partner&#x201D;, as opposed to <ins class="diffins">a </ins>decision being made &#x201C;by the woman alone&#x201D; or &#x201C;by the woman jointly with the partner&#x201D;. Depending <del class="diffmod">in</del><ins class="diffmod">on</ins> the type of contraceptive method being used, a decision by the woman &#x201C;alone&#x201D; or &#x201C;jointly with the partner&#x201D; does not always entail that the woman is empowered or has bargaining skills. Conversely, it is safe to assume that a woman that does not participate, at all, in making contraceptive choices is disempowered as far as sexual and reproductive decisions are concerned. </p>
<p>A woman&#x2019;s ability to say no to her husband/partner if she does not want to have sexual intercourse is well aligned with the concept of sexual autonomy and women&#x2019;s empowerment.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.b. Comment and limitations (REC_USE_LIM)</div></div></div><p>Until recently, the indicator captured results for married and in-union women and adolescent girls of reproductive age (15&#x2013;49 years old) <u>who are using any type of contraception</u>. In the phase of the national Demographic and Health Survey (DHS&#x2013;7) and later rounds, as well as in other data collection instruments including the MICS and GGS, the questionnaire <del class="diffmod">are</del><ins class="diffmod">is</ins> extended to respondents whether they are using contraception or not. The measure does not cover women and girls that are not married or in <ins class="diffins">a </ins>union, as they do not usually make &#x201C;joint decisions&#x201D; on their <del class="diffdel">own </del>health care with their partners.</p>
<p>As of early <del class="diffmod">2021</del><ins class="diffmod">2022</ins>, a total of 64 countries, the majority in sub-Saharan Africa, have at least one survey with data on all three questions necessary for calculating Indicator 5.6.1. <ins class="diffins">28 countries have at least 2 data points between 2006 and 2020. </ins>Broader data sources are needed<ins class="diffins">,</ins> and efforts to increase data coverage are underway. </p>
<p>In many national contexts, household surveys, which are the main data source for this indicator, exclude the homeless and are likely to under-enumerate linguistic or religious minority groups.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.c.
