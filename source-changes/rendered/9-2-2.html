<p>This indicator presents the share of manufacturing employment in total employment.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Concepts:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Employment comprises all persons of working age who during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. </p>
<p>The working-age population is usually defined as all persons aged 15 and above. </p>
<p>For further clarification, see: Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization (2013), available from <a href="http://ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm">http://ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm</a>. </p>
<p>No distinction is made between persons employed full time and those working less than full time.</p>
<p>The manufacturing sector is defined according to the International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC) revision 4 (2008, the latest) or revision 3 (1990). It refers to industries belonging to sector C in revision 4 or sector D in revision 3.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.f. Treatment of missing values (i) at country level and (ii) at regional level (IMPUTATION)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">&#x2022;</ins></strong> <strong><ins class="mod">At country level</ins></strong></p>
<p>Multivariate regression and cross-validation techniques are used to impute missing values at the country level. The additional variables used for the imputation include a range of indicators, including labour market and economic data. However, the imputed missing country values are only used to calculate the global and regional estimates; they are not used for international reporting on the SDG indicators by the ILO. For further information on the estimates, please refer to the ILO modelled estimates methodological overview, available at https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/ilo-modelled-estimates/.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">&#x2022;</ins></strong> <strong><ins class="mod">At regional and global levels</ins></strong></p>
<p>The aggregates are derived from the ILO modelled estimates that are used to produce global and regional estimates of, amongst others, employment by economic activity. These models use multivariate regression and cross-validation techniques to impute missing values at the country level, which are then aggregated to produce regional and global estimates. The regional and global shares of employment in manufacturing are obtained by first adding up, across countries, the numerator and denominator of the formula that defines the manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment - outlined above. Once both magnitudes are produced at the desired level of aggregation, the ratio between the two is used to compute the share for each regional grouping and the global level. Notice that this direct aggregation method can be used due to the imputation of missing observations. For further information on the estimates, please refer to the ILO modelled estimates methodological overview, available at https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/ilo-modelled-estimates/.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">5.

<p>Data is available in ILOSTAT for 177 countries and territories.</p>

<p>Data for this indicator is available from 2000 in the UN Global SDG Database, but longer time series are available in ILOSTAT.</p>
