Data sources (SOURCE_TYPE)</div></div></div><p>In response to the Sixty-ninth World Health Assembly (WHA69.19), an online National Health Workforce Accounts (NHWA) data platform was developed to facilitate national reporting. In addition to the reporting, the platform also serves as an analytical tool at the national/regional and global levels. Since Its launch in November 2017, Member States are called to use the NHWA data platform to report health workforce data. Complementing the national reporting through the NHWA data platform, additional sources such as the National Census, Labour Force Surveys and key administrative national and regional sources are also employed. Most of the data from administrative sources are derived from published national health sector reviews and/or official country reports to WHO offices.<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">3.e.

Comment and limitations (REC_USE_LIM)</div></div></div><p>Data on health workers tend to be more complete for the public health sector and may underestimate the active workforce in the private, military, nongovernmental organization and faith-based health sectors. In many cases, information maintained at the national regulatory bodies and professional councils is not updated.<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p><del class="diffdel">
</del><p><del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p>
<p>As data is not always published annually for each country, the latest available data has been used. Due to the differences in data sources, considerable variability remains across countries in the coverage, periodicity, quality and completeness of the original data. Densities are calculated using <ins class="diffins">the latest </ins>national population estimates from the United Nations Population Division&apos;s World Population Prospects database and may vary from densities produced by the country.<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.c.

</del><p><del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p>
<p>The figures for number of nursing and midwifery include nursing personnel and midwifery personnel, whenever available. In many countries, nurses trained with midwifery skills are counted and reported as nurses. This makes the distinction between nursing personnel and midwifery personnel difficult to draw.<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p><del class="diffdel">
</del><p><del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p>
<p>The figures for number of dentists include dentists in the given national and/or subnational area.

<p>In general, the denominator data for workforce density (i.e. national population estimates) are obtained from the United Nations Population Division&apos;s World Population Prospects database.
