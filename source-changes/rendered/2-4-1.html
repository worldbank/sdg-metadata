Treatment of missing values (i) at country level and (ii) at regional level (IMPUTATION)</div></div></div><p>Partial non-response at individual level (farm holding) will be imputed using appropriate statistical techniques, such as nearest-neighbour algorithms. The decision on whether to impute or not and the choice of the method is a function of the nature of the variable to impute and the amount and type of data available for the imputation, such as the availability of auxiliary data coming from different sources (e.g. surveys, administrative information). </p>
<p>It is important to clearly distinguish missing data from non-applicable events. As specified above and in the sub-indicator methodology sheets, some sub-indicators can be recorded as &#x2018;not applicable&#x2019; for a given farm. In this case, the farm will be considered sustainable from the perspective of the given sub-indicators.</p>

Data availability and disaggregation (COVERAGE)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Data availability:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Many sub-indicators for this indicator are already being collected in countries, either as part of existing farm surveys or through other data sources such as environmental monitoring systems, administrative data or household surveys. Yet they are not collected with a common set of criteria that fulfil the indicator requirements, guarantee the same quality or adherence to international comparability. </p>
<h2>Time series:</h2>
<p>SDG Indicator 2.4.1 measures progress towards more sustainable and productive agriculture over a three year periodicity because for many sub-indicators, it is likely that changes will be relatively limited from a year to another. Furthermore, the 3-year periodicity will enable countries to have three data points on the indicator before 2030.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Disaggregation:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Indicator 2.4.1 is expected to be collected through farm surveys and the result expressed as a national value. However, the methodology is scale independent and can be adopted at any geographical level. In addition the indicator can be disaggregated according to type of farming system (crop, livestock or mixed) and other characteristics of the farm e.g. household/non-household sector, irrigated/non-irrigated or gender of the farm holder.</p></div>
