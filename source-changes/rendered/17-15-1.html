Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Definition:</ins></strong></p>
<p>This indicator measures the extent to which, and the ways in which, all concerned development partners use country-owned results frameworks (CRFs) to plan development cooperation efforts and assess their performance. </p>
<p>The indicator assesses the degree to which providers of development cooperation (i.e. development partners) design their interventions by relying on objectives and results indicators that are drawn from country government-owned results frameworks reflecting the country&#x2019;s development priorities and goals. </p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Concepts:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Country-owned results frameworks (CRFs) define a country&#x2019;s approach to results and its associated monitoring and evaluation systems focusing on performance and achievement of development results. Using a minimal definition, these results frameworks include agreed objectives and results indicators (i.e. output, outcome, and/or impact). They also set targets to measure progress in achieving the objectives defined in the government&#x2019;s planning documents. </p>
<p>The definition of country-owned results framework used for this indicator allows the possibility to use equivalent priority-setting mechanisms at the country level since not all countries articulate their priorities through consistent, integrated CRFs.</p>
<p>In practice, country-owned results frameworks defined at the country level are often broadly stated (e.g. long-term vision plans, national development strategies) and operationalised in more detail at the sector level (e.g. sector strategies), where specific targets and indicators are set for a given timeframe.</p>
<p>Some examples of CRFs are long-term vision plans; national development strategies; joint government-multi-donor plans; government&#x2019;s sector strategies, policies and plans; subnational planning instruments, as well as other frameworks (e.g. budget support performance matrices, sector-wide approaches). In contrast, planning and priority setting documents produced outside the government, such as country strategies prepared by development partners, are not considered CRFs.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.f. Treatment of missing values (i) at country level and (ii) at regional level (IMPUTATION)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">&#x2022;</ins></strong> <strong><ins class="mod">At country level</ins></strong></p>
<p>There is no treatment of missing values. However, a validation process involving representatives of country governments and country offices as well as headquarters offices of development partners takes place. Missing values are highlighted during this validation process, and attempts are made to fill in these gaps.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">&#x2022;</ins></strong> <strong><ins class="mod">At regional and global levels</ins></strong></p>
<p>There is no imputation of missing values. Attempts are made to minimize gaps in data submissions during the data validation process including triangulation with headquarters offices of development partners.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">5. Data availability and disaggregation (COVERAGE)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Data availability:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Data collected in the 2016 and 2018 monitoring round generated data for a total of 96 recipient countries and for above 100 development partners &#x2013;including the 29 countries that are members of the OECD&#x2019;s Development Assistance Committee and the six major multilateral organizations in terms of development finance (i.e. the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations Development Programme, African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank). </p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Time series:</ins></strong></p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Disaggregation:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Given the bottom-up approach in generating the indicator, disaggregation is possible at the country level and at the development partner level.</p>
<p>While data collection is led at the country level, in a bottom-up approach, global and regional aggregates can be used for monitoring internationally-agreed commitments related to strengthening country ownership and better partner alignment with nationally-set development goals. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">6.
