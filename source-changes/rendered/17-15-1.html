Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
<p>This indicator measures the extent to which, and the ways in which, all concerned development partners use country-owned results frameworks (CRFs) to plan development cooperation efforts and assess their performance. </p>
<p>The indicator assesses the degree to which providers of development cooperation (i.e. development partners) design their interventions by relying on objectives and results indicators that are drawn from country government-owned results frameworks reflecting the country&#x2019;s development priorities and goals. </p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p>Country-owned results frameworks (CRFs) define a country&#x2019;s approach to results and its associated monitoring and evaluation systems focusing on performance and achievement of development results. Using a minimal definition, these results frameworks include agreed objectives and results indicators (i.e. output, outcome, and/or impact). They also set targets to measure progress in achieving the objectives defined in the government&#x2019;s planning documents. </p>
<p>The definition of country-owned results framework used for this indicator allows the possibility to use equivalent priority-setting mechanisms at the country level since not all countries articulate their priorities through consistent, integrated CRFs.</p>
<p>In practice, country-owned results frameworks defined at the country level are often broadly stated (e.g. long-term vision plans, national development strategies) and operationalised in more detail at the sector level (e.g. sector strategies), where specific targets and indicators are set for a given timeframe.</p>
<p>Some examples of CRFs are long-term vision plans; national development strategies; joint government-multi-donor plans; government&#x2019;s sector strategies, policies and plans; subnational planning instruments, as well as other frameworks (e.g. budget support performance matrices<del class="diffmod">,</del><ins class="diffmod">&nbsp;&amp;</ins> sector-wide approaches). In contrast, planning and priority setting documents produced outside the government, such as country strategies prepared by development partners, are not considered CRFs.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">2.b.

Classifications (CLASS_SYSTEM)</div></div></div><p>For developing countries, classification is based on SDG grouping provided by the UN Statistical Office (regional classification, <ins class="diffins">Least Developed Countries (</ins>LDCs<ins class="diffins">)</ins>, <ins class="diffins">Landlocked Developing Countries (</ins>LLDCs<ins class="diffins">)</ins>, <ins class="diffins">Small Island Developing States (</ins>SIDS<ins class="diffins">)</ins>). <del class="diffdel">Income classification follows the World Bank grouping (low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high income).</del></p>
<p>For development partners, classification is based on SDG grouping. In addition, bilateral partners can be distinguished between members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and non-members. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">3.b. Data collection method (COLL_METHOD)</div></div></div><p>(i) For the data collection process of the Global Partnership&apos;s monitoring exercise, a national coordinator is assigned by the country government.

<p>(ii) The national coordinator collects inputs from development partners. The data is submitted to the OECD and UNDP and subsequently undergoes a review round with the headquarters offices of development partners. </p>
<p>(iii) No adjustments are made to the data after they have undergone the validation process. However, inconsistencies or possible problematic values are highlighted and sent back to national coordinators for revision.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">3.c.

Method of computation (DATA_COMP)</div></div></div><p>To provide a comprehensive measure on the extent of use of country-owned results frameworks and other government-led planning tools, the indicator calculates the degree to which objectives, results<ins class="diffins">,</ins> indicators and monitoring frameworks associated with new development interventions are drawn from government sources &#x2013;<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;</ins>including national, sector and subnational planning tools.</p>
<p>For each development intervention of significant size (US$ 100,000 and above) approved during the year of reference, the following dimensions are assessed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Q1. Whether objectives are drawn from country-owned results frameworks, plans and strategies 0/1</li>
  <li>Q2. Share of results (outcome) indicators that are drawn from country-owned results frameworks, plans and strategies %</li>
  <li>Q3. Share of results (outcome) indicators that will rely on sources of data provided by existing country-led monitoring systems or national statistical services to track project progress %</li>
</ul>
<p>Global aggregates for the indicator (for partner countries and providers) are obtained by averaging the three dimensions of alignment with country&#x2019;s priorities and goals across all new interventions for the reporting year. </p>
<p>Aggregated averages per partner country will provide the extent to which CRFs and planning tools are used by providers of development co-operation operating in that specific country in the design and monitoring of new development projects. </p>
<p>All formulas are available at: <a href="http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-17.pdf">http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-17.pdf</a></p>
<p>Aggregated averages per development partner will indicate the extent to which that development partner uses CRFs and planning tools in the design and monitoring of new development projects in countries in which it operates. Formulas are available at: <a href="http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-17.pdf">http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-17.pdf</a></p>
<p>When aggregating, the size (budget amount) of the project/ intervention is not considered as weight in order to give the same level of importance to the extent of use of country-owned results frameworks and planning tools in medium-sized vs. larger projects, as the indicator tries to capture the overall behaviour of development partners in designing new interventions in a given country. Weighting by project size would otherwise <del class="diffmod">over represent</del><ins class="diffmod">overrepresent</ins> infrastructure projects and underrepresent interventions focused on influencing policies and institutional arrangements. Nevertheless, data on project size is available.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.e.

Data availability and disaggregation (COVERAGE)</div></div></div><p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>
<p>Data collected in the 2016 and 2018 monitoring round generated data for a total of 96 recipient countries and for above 100 development partners &#x2013;including the 29 countries that are members of the OECD&#x2019;s Development Assistance Committee and the six major multilateral organizations in terms of development finance (i.e. the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations Development Programme, African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank). </p>
<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>
<p><ins class="diffins">Data for countries have been compiled in 2016 and 2018. From 2023, data will be available on a rolling basis with all countries encouraged to report at least once within a four-year cycle.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>
<p>Given the bottom-up approach in generating the indicator, disaggregation is possible at the country level and at the development partner level.</p>
<p>While data collection is led at the country level, in a bottom-up approach, global and regional aggregates can be used for monitoring internationally-agreed commitments related to strengthening country ownership and better partner alignment with nationally-set development goals. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">6.
