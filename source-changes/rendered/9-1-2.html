</del><h2><del class="diffmod">Definition</del><p><strong><ins class="diffmod">Definitions</ins>:</h2></strong></p>
<p>Passenger and freight volumes are respectively measured in passenger-km and tonne-km, and broken down by mode of transport. For the purposes of monitoring this indicator, passenger-km data are split between aviation, road (broken down between passenger cars, buses and motorcycles) and rail, and tonne-km are split between aviation, road, rail and inland waterways. </p>
<p>As maritime data are not widely available, only tonnes (rather than tonne-km) data at the regional level have been shared.</p>
<h2><p><strong>Concepts:</h2></strong></p>
<p><ins class="mod">Aviation:</ins></p>
<p>The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) through its Statistics Division have established standard methodologies and definitions to collect and report traffic (passenger and freight volume) data related to air transport. These standards and methodologies have been adopted by the 191 Member States of ICAO and also by the Industry stakeholders i.e. air carriers and airports. The data of ICAO is used by States and also the World Bank for its development indicators. ICAO uses Air Transport Reporting Forms A, AS, B and C to arrive at the passenger and freight volumes for air transport.</p>
<p>Precise definition of all different concepts and metadata related to Air Transport Reporting Forms A, AS, B and C to arrive at the passenger and freight volumes for air transport. approved by the ICAO Statistics Division and Member States can be found at the ICAO website given below -</p>
<p><a href="http://www.icao.int/sustainability/pages/eap-sta-excel.aspx/">http://www.icao.int/sustainability/pages/eap-sta-excel.aspx/</a>.</a></p>
<p><ins class="mod">Road, Rail, Inland waterways, Pipelines</ins></p>
<p>The ITF and UNECE, in collaboration with Eurostat, collect data on rail and road, inland waterway and pipeline statistics on an annual basis from all their collective Member countries. Data are collected from Transport Ministries, statistical offices and other institution designated as official data source. Although there are clear definitions for all the terms used in this survey, countries might have different methodologies to calculate tonne-kilometres and passenger-kilometres. Methods could be based on traffic or mobility surveys, use very different sampling methods and estimating techniques which could affect the comparability of their statistics. </p>
<p>Official statistics for road, rail, inland waterways and pipeline transport are only available for UNECE or ITF member States. Data for these modes for other countries come from the ITF&#x2019;s global transport model.</p>
<p>For definitions of all relevant terms, the UNECE/ITF/Eurostat Glossary for Transport Statistics can be consulted. The 5<sup>th</sup> edition of this publication should be released in 2019. The fourth edition from 2009 is available at <a href="https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/wp6/pdfdocs/glossen4.pdf">https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/wp6/pdfdocs/glossen4.pdf</a>. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">3.a.

<p>ICAO Air Transport Reporting Forms approved by the Statistics Division of ICAO and its Member States has been used to define standards, methodologies and to collect aviation data since the 1950&apos;s. ICAO definitions and metadata is also used by the Aviation Industry as the basis of collecting data and conducting analysis.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">3.c.

</del><p>Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and trans-border infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all. Trans-border infrastructure development is best captured by passenger and freight volumes moved by Member States and Regions. A growth in passenger and freight volumes shows a robust infrastructure development happening in States and Regions along with the resultant socio-economic benefit. Air Transport is particularly important not only for the economic and job benefits but also because it is one of the only mode of transport that can be relied on during emergencies and disease outbreaks to reach food, medicines, medical personnel, vaccines and other supplies speedily to the affected persons in the affected areas. In addition, tracking how the non-road share of freight volumes, and the public transport share of passenger volumes, changes over time allows insights into the overall sustainability of the global transport system.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.b.

The growth rates are computed from other socio-economic variables, such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population or urbanization.</p>
<p>For non-ITF/UNECE countries, data points are estimated using the ITF model, which uses several covariates such as GDP, population, transport network coverage&#x2026; A description of the model can be found in the ITF Transport Outlook 2017.</p>

<p>The ITF and UNECE conduct annual checks of their jointly collected data, comparing the data for internal consistency, against previous years, and on a per capita basis across countries, to determine if the data appear reasonable. Significant correspondence is undertaken with the countries over potential errors, and common issues and challenges are discussed at both the ITF annual statistics meeting and the UNECE&#x2019;s annual Working Party on Transport Statistics.</p>
<p>A common problem for many countries is that passenger-km are only collected for public transport. Given that private passenger cars form the majority of passenger trips in most countries, this would clearly significantly underestimate road passenger-km, which is why the breakdown where available between passenger cars, buses and motorcycles is given. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">5.
