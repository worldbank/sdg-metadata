<p>The ITF and UNECE, in collaboration with Eurostat, collect data on rail and road, inland waterway and pipeline statistics on an annual basis from all their collective Member countries. Data are collected from Transport Ministries, statistical offices and other institution designated as official data source. Although there are clear definitions for all the terms used in this survey, countries might have different methodologies to calculate tonne-kilometres and passenger-kilometres. Methods could be based on traffic or mobility surveys, use very different sampling methods and estimating techniques which could affect the comparability of their statistics. </p>
<p>Official statistics for road, rail, inland waterways and pipeline transport are only available for UNECE or ITF member States. Data for these modes for other countries come from the ITF&#x2019;s global transport model.</p>

Rationale (RATIONALE)</div></div></div><p>Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and trans-border infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all. Trans-border infrastructure development is best captured by passenger and freight volumes moved by Member States and Regions. A growth in passenger and freight volumes shows a robust infrastructure development happening in States and Regions along with the resultant socio-economic benefit. Air Transport is particularly important not only for the economic and job benefits but also because it is one of the only mode of transport that can be relied on during emergencies and disease outbreaks to reach food, medicines, medical personnel, vaccines and other supplies speedily to the affected persons in the affected areas. In addition, tracking how the non-road share of freight volumes, and the public transport share of passenger volumes, changes over time allows insights into the overall sustainability of the global transport system.</p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><em><ins class="diffins">Aviation:</ins></em></p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Informed decision-making is the foundation upon which successful businesses are built. In a fast-growing industry like aviation, planners and investors require the most comprehensive, up-to-date, and reliable data. ICAO&#x2019;s aviation data/statistics programme is to provide accurate, reliable and consistent aviation data so that States, international organizations, aviation industry, tourism and other stakeholders can make better projections. The UN recognized ICAO as the central agency responsible for the collection, analysis, publication, standardization, improvement and dissemination of statistics pertaining to civil aviation.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">The volume of international maritime freight and container port traffic movements provide an overall indication of the importance of port infrastructure for trade and development and may be relied upon to infer the quality and adequacy of seaports and their hinterland connections. Maritime transport is the dominant mode of international freight transport when flows are measured in volume terms. Behind the global and regional headline estimates, individual contributions vary by region and type of cargo, reflecting, among other factors, differences in countries&#x2019; economic structures, composition of trade, urbanization, levels of development, extent of integration into global trading networks, degree of participation in global supply chains, and the quality of transport infrastructure.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Established in 1964, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), published its annual Review of Maritime Transport for the first time in 1968. The publication is part of UNCTAD&apos;s research and analytical work in the field of maritime transport aimed at helping developing countries maximize their trade and investment opportunities and increase their participation in the world economy. It has been regularly reconfirmed in the quadrennial Ministerial Conferences, most recently by UNCTAD XIII in Doha (2012) and UNCTAD XIV in Nairobi (2016). The mandates emanating from these conferences have emphasized sustainable and resilient transport as priority action areas and established &#x201C;Sustainable and Climate Resilient Maritime Transport&#x201D; as an important thematic area n UNCTAD&#x2019;s work programme and the Review of Maritime Transport. </ins></p><ins class="diffins">

The objectives of the ITF are to serve as a global platform for discussion and prenegotiation of transport policy issues across all modes. Unique in its global and modal scope, the ITF works to foster a deeper understanding of the role of transport in economic growth, environmental sustainability and social inclusion. It aspires to raise the public profile of transport policy.</ins></p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.d.
