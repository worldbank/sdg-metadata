Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
<p>Civil society organizations (CSOs) make a difference in international development. They provide development services and humanitarian relief, innovate in service delivery, build local capacity and advocate with and for the poor. Acting alone, however, their impact is limited in scope, scale and sustainability. CSOs need to engage in government policy processes more effectively. The development of sustainable human settlements calls for the active engagement of all key stakeholders with particular attention to project/programme beneficiaries and vulnerable groups. Therefore local and national governments should strive to: <strong><ins class="mod">a)</ins></strong> facilitate and protect people&#x2019;s participation and civic engagement through independent civil society organizations that can be from diverse backgrounds - local, national, and international; <strong><ins class="mod">b)</ins></strong> promote civic and human rights education and training programmes to make urban residents aware of their rights and the changing roles of diverse women, men, and young women and men in urban settings; <strong><ins class="mod">c)</ins></strong> remove the barriers that block participation of socially marginalized groups and promote non-discrimination and the full and equal participation of women, young men and women and marginalized groups. To monitor this indicator fully, it is important to define cities as unique entities and define what constitutes direct participation structures of civil society. Urban planning and management are more clear concepts that UN-Habitat has worked on developing for the last few decades and these are well articulated in the urban agenda documents. Experts who have worked on the methodological developments of this indicator have <del class="diffmod">there</del><ins class="diffmod">therefore</ins> put forth the below definitions to help guide the work on this indicator.</p>

Comment and limitations (REC_USE_LIM)</div></div></div><p>The indicator measures the availability of structures for civil society participation in urban planning and management, which is a reflection of structures for citizen voices/participation. The fact that informed evaluators conduct the evaluation can introduce biases. These biases and discrepancies have been examined in the pilot phases and so far the experiences is that the marginal differences are not as large as we were expecting. Overall, the evaluators&#x2019; assessments sometimes do not reflect a full analysis of the effectiveness or accessibility of these structures in its totality, but gives a local idea of how these evaluators view the inclusiveness and openness on these structures to accommodate the participation of citizens and civil society. Changes in data will be examined for intra-city differences and within country differences over time to understand more sources for variations and internal consistencies. </p>
<p>Within the civic society landscape, there are many types of players including civil societies led by individuals, community groups, advocates, corporations and foundations. Similarly, there are many different views about the relevance and importance of civil society participation particularly, perhaps, among different groups as listed above and for these different structures at the urban level maybe available for involvement or not. </p>
<p>Finally, civic society engagement in urban planning and management involves overlapping pathways, and goals as well as a mix of planned and unpredicted elements. Advancing toward a measurement frame is intended to help sort out theories and pathways &#x2013; not to set hard boundary lines, but rather to help both urban managers and communities better understand what they are trying to achieve, and how they are getting there.</p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><ins class="diffins">We also recognize that there are some countries where the legal instruments that govern cities and municipalities require that civil society are involved in the day-to-day urban planning and management of cities/municipalities. Hence, such countries can report directly the national level engagement of civil society as 100%, if in practice all municipalities apply the legal requirements for civil society engagement in urban planning and management.</ins></p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.c.

</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Option 1:</ins> a scorecard approach will be used to evaluate the available structures for civil society participation in urban planning and management, as evaluated by five (5) local experts from government, academia, civil society and international organizations. The identifications and selection of these 5 local evaluators/experts will be guided by local urban observatories teams that are available in many cities. In the pilot exercises, these urban observatories as local custodians of urban data at the city level are able to coordinate the assessments<del class="diffdel">,</del> and check for consistencies and relevant local references that guide the decisions and scores of the evaluators.</p>
<p>A questionnaire with a 4-point Likert scale (strongly disagree, disagree, agree, and strongly agree) will be used to measure and test the existence of structures for civil society participation in urban governance and management. As experts, we agreed that these structures are examined through four core elements and these were assessed in the completed pilot exercises as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Are there structures for civil society participation in urban planning, including design and agreements, that are direct, regular and democratic?</li>
  <li>Are there structures for civil society participation in local urban budget decision-making, that are direct, regular and democratic?</li>
  <li>Are there structures for civil society evaluation and feedback on the performance of urban management, that are direct, regular and democratic?</li>
  <li>Do these structures promote the participation of women, young men and women, and/or other marginalized groups?</li>
</ol>
<p>The evaluators score each of the questions on the Likert Scale, as below: </p>
<p>1 - Strongly disagree, 2 - Disagree, 3 - Agree, 4 - Strongly agree</p>

<p>The Likert Scale use the following guidance for grading: </p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Strongly Disagree:</ins></strong> There are no structures in place or available structures do not allow civil society participation that is direct, regular or democratic.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Disagree:</ins></strong> Structures exist that allow civil society participation, but they are only partially direct, regular and democratic; or they are only one of direct, regular or democratic.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Agree:</ins></strong> Structures exist that allow and encourage civil society participation that is direct and/or regular and/or democratic, but not all three. </p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Strongly Agree</ins></strong>: Structures exist that allow and encourage civil society participation that is fully direct, regular and democratic.</p>
<p>Once each of the five (5) categories is evaluated as shown in the table above by a single evaluator, the total average score of the single evaluator is computed. The various scores of the evaluators are then <strong><ins class="mod">averaged</ins></strong> to compute the final score for every city.</p>
<p>To determine the proportion of cities with a direct participation structure of civil society in urban planning and management that operates regularly and democratically, a midpoint on the Likert scale of 2.5 will be used. The value of the indicator is the proportion of cities with overall score that is greater than the mid-point. </p>
<p>As a result, if we have N cities selected for the evaluation in a given country, and n is the number of cities with scores that are higher than the mid-point, the value of the indicator will be calculated as:</p>
