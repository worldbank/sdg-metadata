Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
<p>The indicator is defined as the proportion of water bodies in the country that have good ambient water quality. Ambient water quality refers to natural, untreated water in rivers, lakes and groundwaters and represents a combination of natural influences together with the impacts of all anthropogenic activities. The indicator relies on water quality data derived from in situ measurements and the analysis of samples collected from surface and groundwaters. Water quality is assessed by means of core physical and chemical parameters that reflect natural water quality related to climatological and geological factors, together with major impacts on water quality. The continuous monitoring of all surface and groundwaters is economically unfeasible and not required to sufficiently characterize the status of ambient water quality in a country. Therefore, countries select river, lake and groundwater bodies that are representative and significant for the assessment and management of water quality to monitor and report on indicator 6.3.2. The quality status of individual water bodies is classified based on the compliance of the available water quality monitoring data for the core parameters with target values defined by the country. The indicator is computed as the proportion of the number of water bodies classified as having good quality (i.e. with at least 80 % compliance) to the total number of assessed water bodies, expressed as a percentage. </p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p>The concepts and definitions used in the methodology have been based on existing international frameworks and glossaries (WMO<ins class="diffins">,</ins> 2012) unless where indicated otherwise below.</p>
<p><strong>Aquifer: </strong>Geological formation capable of storing, transmitting and yielding exploitable quantities of water. </p>
<p><strong>Classification of water quality: </strong>If at least 80% of the monitoring values for prescribed parameters in a water body comply with their respective target values, the water body is classified as having a &#x201C;good&#x201D; water quality status<strong>. </strong>Each water body is classified as being of &#x201C;good&#x201D; or &#x201C;not good&#x201D; status.<em> </em></p>
<p><strong>Groundwater</strong>: Subsurface water occupying the saturated zone. </p>
<p><strong>Groundwater body</strong>: A distinct volume of groundwater within an aquifer or aquifers (EU<ins class="diffins">,</ins> 2000). Groundwater bodies that cross river basin district (RBD) boundaries should be divided at the boundary with each separate portion of the groundwater body being reported separately along with its respective RBD. </p>
<p><strong>Lake:</strong> Inland body of standing surface water of significant extent. </p>
<p><strong>Non-point-source pollution:</strong> Pollution of water bodies from dispersed sources such as fertilizers, chemicals and pesticides used in agricultural activities.</p>
<p><strong>Parameter: </strong>Water quality variable or characteristic of water quality, also called a determinand.</p>
<p><strong>Point source pollution</strong>: Pollution with a precisely located origin.</p>
<p><strong>Pollution (of water)</strong>: Introduction into water of any undesirable substance which renders the water unfit for its intended use.</p>
<p><strong>Pollutant</strong>: Substance which disrupts and interferes with the equilibrium of a water system and impairs the suitability of using the water for a desired purpose. </p>
<p><strong>Reservoir: </strong>Body of water, either natural or man-made, used for storage, regulation and control of water resources.</p>
<p><strong>River: </strong>Large stream which serves as the natural drainage for a basin.</p>
<p><strong>River basin: </strong>Geographical area having a common outlet for its surface runoff.</p>
<p><strong>River basin district: </strong>Area of land, made up of one or more neighbouring river basins together with their associated groundwaters (EU, 2000).</p>
<p><strong>River water body</strong>: A coherent section of a river that is discrete (does not overlap with another water body) and is significant rather than arbitrarily designated. </p>
<p><strong>Stream: </strong>Flowing body of water in a natural surface channel.</p>
<p><strong>Surface water: </strong>Water which flows over, or lies on, the ground surface. </p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p>Note: Indicator 6.3.2 does not include the monitoring of water quality in wetlands under monitoring level 1.</p>
<p><strong>Target value</strong>: A value (or range) for any given water quality parameter that indicates the threshold for a designated water quality, such as good water quality rather than acceptable water quality.</p>
<p><strong>Toxic substance</strong>: Chemical substance which can disturb the physiological functions of humans, animals and plants.</p>
<p><strong>Transboundary waters: </strong>Surface or ground waters which mark, cross or are located on boundaries between two or more States; wherever transboundary waters flow directly into the sea, these transboundary waters end at a straight line across their respective mouths between points on the low-water line of the banks (UNECE, 1992).</p>
<p><strong>Water quality index: </strong>The measured water quality results for all parameters combined into a numeric value for each monitoring location. These scores are then aggregated over the time of the assessment period. The index score can range between zero (worst) to 100 (best).</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">2.b.

Rationale (RATIONALE)</div></div></div><p>Good ambient water quality is essential for protecting aquatic ecosystems and the services they provide, including: the preservation of biodiversity; the protection of human health during recreational use and through the provision of drinking water; the support of human nutrition through the provision of fish and water for irrigation; the enabling of a variety of economic activities; and the strengthening of the resilience of people against water-related disasters. Good ambient water quality is therefore closely linked to the achievement of many other Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p>Target 6.3 aims at improving water quality and indicator 6.3.2 provides a mechanism for determining whether, and to which extent, water quality management measures are contributing to the improvement of water quality over time. The indicator is also directly linked to indicator 6.3.1 on wastewater treatment because inadequate wastewater treatment leads to degradation in quality of the waters receiving the wastewater effluents. It directly informs progress towards target 6.3 and is strongly linked to target 6.6 on water-related ecosystems, as well as target 14.1 on marine pollution (coastal eutrophication).</p>
<p>The methodology recognises that countries have different capacity levels to monitor water quality, with many developed countries operating extensive and complex programmes that collect and report data to existing reporting frameworks beyond the scope of this methodology. For these countries it is recognised that this methodology will not contribute to improving their water quality; however it must be sufficiently flexible to capture data from existing monitoring frameworks without burdening countries with additional reporting obligations. Conversely, many of the least developed countries currently do not monitor water quality or operate very limited monitoring programmes. The methodology must therefore allow these countries to contribute to the global indicator, according to their national capacity and available resources. </p>
<p>The development of the methodology builds on best practice for water quality monitoring promoted by the <del class="diffmod">UN Environment</del><ins class="diffmod">UNEP</ins> GEMS/Water programme since 1978 together with testing by several pilot countries during the Integrated Monitoring Initiative Proof of Concept phase of 2016, and external review by experts and international organizations. This led to revision of the original methodology, which was then further tested through the 2017 global data drive. The feedback received has contributed to the present refined methodology.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.b. Comment and limitations (REC_USE_LIM)</div></div></div><p>The monitoring and reporting of SDG Indicator 6.3.2 requires considerable national financial and human capacities to regularly measure water quality parameters at sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions, and to consistently collect, quality-assure and process the monitoring data to compute the indicator. Substantial investments in monitoring and data management infrastructures, as well as targeted capacity development in water quality monitoring programme design and operation, will be required in many countries to enhance national capacities to regularly and consistently report on the indicator. </p>
<p>Recognizing the differences in monitoring and data processing capacities among countries, the indicator methodology offers a progressive monitoring approach allowing countries to start with reporting based on their existing capacity and progressively enhance the data coverage and indicator significance with increasing capacity.</p><del class="diffdel">
</del><p><del class="diffdel">Level 1 monitoring includes a set of general, easily measurable, physico-chemical water quality parameters that can indicate water quality degradation. They can be used to assess the quality status of water bodies, facilitating global comparability and maintaining a balance between the significance of the indicator and the monitoring requirements for each country. </del></p><del class="diffdel">
</del><p><del class="diffdel">Level 2 monitoring allows countries with enhanced capacities to include additional water quality parameters, such as toxic substances and biological monitoring, as well as more sophisticated quality classification schemes to assess and report on the quality of their water bodies more accurately.</del></p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.d.
