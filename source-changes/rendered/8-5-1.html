Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><p><strong>Definition:</strong> </p>
<p>This indicator provides information on the mean hourly earnings from paid employment of employees by sex, occupation, age<ins class="diffins">,</ins> and disability status. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong> </p>
<p>Earnings refer to the gross remuneration in cash or in kind paid to employees, as a rule at regular intervals, for time worked or work done together with remuneration for time not worked, such as annual vacation, other type of paid leave or holidays. Earnings exclude employers&#x2019; contributions in respect of their employees paid to social security and pension schemes and also the benefits received by employees under these schemes. Earnings also exclude severance and termination pay. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For international comparability purposes, statistics of earnings used relate to employees&#x2019; gross remuneration, i.e. the total before any deductions are made by the employer in respect of taxes, contributions of employees to social security and pension schemes, life insurance premiums, union dues and other obligations of employees. As stated in the indicator title, data on earnings should be presented on the basis of the arithmetic average of the hourly earnings of all employees. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">3.b. Data collection method (COLL_METHOD)</div></div></div><p>The ILO Department of Statistics processes national household survey micro datasets in line with internationally<del class="diffmod">-</del><ins class="diffmod">&nbsp;</ins>agreed indicator concepts and definitions set forth by the International Conference of Labour Statisticians. For data that could not be obtained through this processing or directly from government websites, the ILO sends out an annual ILOSTAT questionnaire to all relevant agencies within each country (national statistical office, labour ministry, etc.) requesting the latest annual data and any revisions on numerous labour market topics and indicators, including many SDG indicators.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">3.g.

Comment and limitations (REC_USE_LIM)</div></div></div><p>The variety of possible sources for statistics on earnings greatly hinders international comparability, as each type of source has its own coverage, scope<ins class="diffins">,</ins> and characteristics. It would not be fully accurate to compare, for example, hourly earnings from a labour force survey for one country with hourly earnings from an establishment survey for another. The use of non-standard definitions and the heterogeneity of operational criteria applied further hamper cross-country comparisons. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.d.
