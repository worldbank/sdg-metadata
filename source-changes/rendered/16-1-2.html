Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Definitions:</ins></strong></p>
<p>This indicator is defined as the total count of conflict-related deaths divided by the total population, expressed per 100,000 population.</p>
<p>&#x2018;Conflict&#x2019; is defined as &#x2018;armed conflict&#x2019; in reference to a terminology enshrined in International Humanitarian Law (IHL), and applied to situations based on the assessment of the United Nations (UN) and other internationally mandated entities. &#x2018;Conflict-related deaths&#x2019; refers to direct and indirect deaths associated to armed conflict. &#x2018;Population&#x2019; refers to total resident population in a given situation of armed conflict included in the indicator, in a given year. Population data are derived from annual estimates produced by the UN Population Division.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Concepts:</ins></strong></p>
<p><em>&#x2018;Conflict&#x2019;</em></p>
<p>According to IHL, the branch of international law, which specifically focuses on armed conflicts, two types of armed conflicts exist: international armed conflicts (IAC) and non-international armed conflicts (NIAC). </p>
<p>IAC exist whenever there is resort to armed force between two or more States. An IAC does not exist in cases in which use of force is the result of an error (e.g. involuntary incursion into foreign territory, wrongly identifying the target); and when the territorial State has given its consent to an intervention. </p>
<p>NIAC are protracted armed confrontations occurring between governmental armed forces and the forces of one or more armed groups, or between such groups arising on the territory of a State. The armed confrontation must reach a &#x201C;minimum level of intensity&#x201D; and the parties involved in the conflict must show a &#x201C;minimum of organisation&#x201D;. </p>
<p><em>&#x2018;Conflict-related deaths&#x2019;</em></p>
<p>Direct deaths are deaths where there are reasonable grounds to believe that they resulted directly from war operations and that the acts, decisions and/or purposes that caused these deaths were in furtherance of or under the guise of armed conflict. </p>
<p>These deaths may have been caused by (i) the use of weapons or (ii) other means and methods. Deaths caused by the use of weapons, include but are not limited to those inflicted by firearms, missiles, mines, and bladed weapons. It may also include deaths resulting from aerial attacks and bombardments (e.g. of military bases, cities and villages), crossfire, explosive remnants of war, targeted killings or assassinations, force protection incidents. Deaths caused by other means and methods may include deaths from torture or sexual and gender-based violence, intentional killing using starvation, depriving prisoners of access to health care or denying access to essential goods and services (e.g. an ambulance stopped at a check point).</p>
<p>Indirect deaths are deaths resulting from a loss of access to essential goods and services (e.g. economic slowdown, shortages of medicines or reduced farming capacity that result in lack of access to adequate food, water, sanitation, health care and safe conditions of work) that are caused or aggravated by the situation of armed conflict.</p>
<p>By definition, these deaths should be separated from other violent deaths which are, in principle, not connected to the situation of armed conflict (e.g. intentional and non-intentional homicides, self-defence, self-inflicted), but are still relevant to the implementation and measurement of SDG target 16.1. The International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) provides definitional elements and classification of violent deaths both related and not related to armed conflict. The ICCS provides indications on how to distinguish between intentional homicides, killings directly related to war/armed conflict and killings that amount to war crimes.</p>
<p><em>&#x2018;Cause&#x2019;</em> refers to the weapons, means and methods that caused the conflict-related deaths. The categories for the disaggregation of the &#x2018;c<em>ause of death</em>&#x2019; for direct deaths build on the WHO International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), ICCS, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) overview of weapons regulated by IHL, UN practice and OHCHR casualty recording. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.f. Treatment of missing values (i) at country level and (ii) at regional level (IMPUTATION)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">&#x2022;</ins></strong> <strong><ins class="mod">At country level</ins></strong></p>
<p>As a starting point, the indicator will only include documented conflict-related direct deaths. If there are no documented conflict-related direct deaths for a particular situation of armed conflict, no estimate of missing values will be computed. Specific to the nature of this indicator, it is worth noting that depending on the availability and quality of data over the course of the armed conflict, statistical surveys and techniques may be used to estimate undocumented direct conflict-related deaths, adding the statistical estimates to the documented cases.</p>
<p>National datasets with sufficiently well documented direct deaths constitute an essential source for further statistical analysis and estimations of undocumented direct deaths. As indirect deaths would typically fall outside the scope of common casualty recording practices (that rather focus on direct deaths), they may be captured using additional administrative records and/or statistical surveys allowing the measurement of excess mortality, namely all the deaths (direct and indirect) that would not have occurred in time of peace, as defined and measured by epidemiologists. </p>
<p>The methodology for these estimations will be further developed in collaboration with national statistical offices, national human rights institutions, UN entities and civil society organizations.</p>

<p>At the time of drafting the present metadata for the reclassification request to the IAEG-SDG, data documented direct conflict-related deaths of civilians have been collected for most of the deadliest situations of armed conflict in the SDG regions of Southern Asia, Western Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Northern Africa, Latin America and Europe. Not all of these data, however, have been collated for global SDGs indicators reporting purposes. </p>

<p>2015 - 2017</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Disaggregation:</ins></strong></p>
<p>The recommended disaggregation for this indicator are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sex of person killed (Man, Woman, Unknown)</li>
  <li>Age group of person killed (Adult (18 and above), Child (below 18), Unknown)</li>
  <li>Cause of death (Heavy weapons and explosive munitions; Planted explosives and unexploded ordnance (UXO); Small arms and light weapons;; Incendiary; Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN); Electromagnetic weapons; Less lethal weapons; Denial of access to/destruction of objects indispensable to survival; Accidents related to conflict; Use of objects and other means; Unknown)</li>
  <li>Status of the person killed (Civilian, Other protected person, Member of armed forces, Person directly participating in hostilities, Unknown) </li>
</ul></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">6. Comparability/deviation from international standards (COMPARABILITY)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Sources of discrepancies:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Discrepancies might exist between national definitions, international statistical and legal standards, coverage and quality of data, according to the mandate, methods and capacity of data providers. Capacity building for the implementation of the methodology for this indicator by data providers will improve quality and consistency across data sets.</p></div>
