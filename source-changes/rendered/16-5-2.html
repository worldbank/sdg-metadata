Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
<p>The percent of firms experiencing at least one bribe payment request across 6 public transactions dealing with utilities access, permits, licenses, and taxes. </p>
<p>In every Enterprise Survey (<a href="http://www.enterprisesurveys.org">www.enterprisesurveys.org</a>), there are standard questions which ask the survey respondent if they were expected to give a gift or informal payment during a transaction with a public official. There are six, separate transactions which make up this indicator, they include an application for an electrical connection, an application for a water connection, an application for a construction-related permit, an application for an import license, an application for an operating license, and during an inspection/meeting with tax officials. In all of these transactions, if the respondent indicates &#x2018;yes&#x2019; they had the transaction (e.g. they applied for an import license), then there is a follow-up question which asks if the respondent was expected to provide a gift or an informal payment during this transaction (an application or meeting). The response options include &#x201C;yes&#x201D;, &#x201C;no&#x201D;, &#x201C;don&#x2019;t know&#x201D;,and &#x201C;refuse&#x201D;. Note that refusals are accepted and recorded but for the purposes of indicator construction, refusals are considered as a &#x2018;yes&#x2019;. The indicator 16.5.2 is measuring whether the respondent indicated &#x2018;yes&#x2019; to a bribe payment for any of these six transactions.</p>
<p>Enterprise Surveys are firm-level surveys conducted in World Bank client countries. The survey focuses on various aspects of the business environment as well as firm&#x2019;s outcome measures such as annual sales, productivity, etc. The surveys are conducted via face-to-face interviews with the top manager or business owner. For each country, the survey is conducted approximately every 4-5 years.</p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p>The respondents to the Enterprise Survey are firms- either manufacturing or services establishments. These are registered (formal) firms with 5+ employees. The firms are either fully or partially private (100% state-owned firms are ineligible for the Enterprise Survey). More information on the survey methodology can be found on the Methodology page of the website: <a href="http://www.enterprisesurveys.org/methodology">www.enterprisesurveys.org/methodology</a></p>
<p>A gift or an informal payment is considered a &#x2018;bribe&#x2019;.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">3.a.

<p>The Enterprise Survey captures several descriptive characteristics of the respondent firms including: gender of top manager, primary business activity of the firm, subnational location of the firm, exporting status, number of employees, degree of foreign ownership, and several other characteristics. Hence the indicator can be disaggregated by the levels of these individual characteristics.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">0.d.
