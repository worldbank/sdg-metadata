<p>In every Enterprise Survey (www.enterprisesurveys.org), there <del class="diffmod">is a</del><ins class="diffmod">are</ins> standard <del class="diffmod">question</del><ins class="diffmod">questions</ins> which <del class="diffmod">asks</del><ins class="diffmod">ask</ins> the survey respondent if they were <del class="diffmod">inspected</del><ins class="diffmod">expected</ins> <del class="diffmod">by</del><ins class="diffmod">to give a gift</ins> or <del class="diffmod">required</del><ins class="diffmod">informal</ins> <del class="diffmod">to</del><ins class="diffmod">payment</ins> <del class="diffmod">meet</del><ins class="diffmod">during a transaction with a public official. There are six, separate transactions which make up this indicator, they include an application for an electrical connection, an application for a water connection, an application for a construction-related permit, an application for an import license, an application for an operating license, and during an inspection/meeting</ins> with tax officials. <del class="diffmod">If</del><ins class="diffmod">In all of these transactions, if</ins> the respondent indicates &#x2018;yes&#x2019;<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;they had the transaction (e.g. they applied for an import license)</ins>, then there is a follow-up question which asks if the respondent was expected to provide a gift or an informal payment during <del class="diffmod">these</del><ins class="diffmod">this</ins> <del class="diffmod">inspections/meetings</del><ins class="diffmod">transaction (an application or meeting)</ins>.

Note that refusals are accepted and recorded but for the purposes of indicator construction, refusals are considered as a &#x2018;yes&#x2019;. The indicator 16.5.2 is measuring whether the respondent indicated &#x2018;yes&#x2019; to a bribe payment for any of these six transactions</ins>.</p>
<p>Enterprise Surveys are firm-level surveys conducted in World Bank client countries. The survey focuses on various aspects of the business environment as well as firm&#x2019;s outcome measures such as annual sales, productivity, etc. The surveys are conducted via face-to-face interviews with the top manager or business owner. For each country, the survey is conducted approximately every 4-5 years.</p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p>The respondents to the Enterprise Survey are firms- either manufacturing or services establishments. These are registered (formal) firms with 5+ employees. The firms are either fully or partially private (100% state-owned firms are ineligible for the Enterprise Survey). More information on the survey methodology can be found on the Methodology page of the website: www.enterprisesurveys.org/methodology</p>
<p>A gift or an informal payment is considered a &#x2018;bribe&#x2019;.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.a. Rationale (RATIONALE)</div></div></div><p>The rationale for this indicator is to ascertain whether firms are solicited for gifts or informal payments (i.e. bribes) when <del class="diffmod">meeting</del><ins class="diffmod">undertaking</ins> <del class="diffmod">with</del><ins class="diffmod">transactions</ins> <del class="diffmod">tax</del><ins class="diffmod">that involve public</ins> officials. <del class="diffmod">Paying</del><ins class="diffmod">Applying for regulatory licenses, obtaining utility connections, and paying</ins> taxes are required of formal forms in most countries and hence the rational for this indicator is to measure the incidence of corruption during <del class="diffmod">this</del><ins class="diffmod">these</ins> routine <del class="diffmod">interaction</del><ins class="diffmod">transactions</ins>. The key strength of the Enterprise Survey is that most of the questions in the survey pertain to the actual, day-to-day experiences of the firm; <del class="diffmod">this</del><ins class="diffmod">these</ins> <del class="diffmod">question</del><ins class="diffmod">questions</ins> regarding corruption <del class="diffmod">during tax inspections/meetings is</del><ins class="diffmod">are</ins> not<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;an</del> opinion-based question but rather <del class="diffmod">a question</del><ins class="diffmod">are</ins> grounded in the firm&#x2019;s <ins class="diffins">day-to-day </ins>reality.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.b. Comment and limitations (REC_USE_LIM)</div></div></div><p>The key strength of the Enterprise Survey is that most of the questions in the survey pertain to the actual, day-to-day experiences of the firm; <del class="diffmod">this</del><ins class="diffmod">these</ins> <del class="diffmod">question</del><ins class="diffmod">questions</ins> regarding corruption <del class="diffmod">during tax inspections/meetings is</del><ins class="diffmod">are</ins> not<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;an</del> opinion-based question but rather <del class="diffmod">a question</del><ins class="diffmod">are</ins> grounded in the firm&#x2019;s<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;day-to-day</ins> reality.</p>
<p>The limitations include that some countries&#x2019; data is almost 10 years old (e.g. <del class="diffmod">South</del><ins class="diffmod">Burkina</ins> <del class="diffmod">Africa</del><ins class="diffmod">Faso</ins> and Brazil). This is due to the fact that these face-to-face survey projects can be expensive in some countries and hence due to budget limitations, the World Bank hasn&#x2019;t been able to update some of the Enterprise Surveys data in a subset of countries. Another limitation is that the surveys are done mostly in World Bank client countries and hence <del class="diffmod">most</del><ins class="diffmod">several</ins> high-income countries are not covered by the surveys (US, Canada, <del class="diffmod">Western</del><ins class="diffmod">UK,</ins> <del class="diffmod">European countries</del><ins class="diffmod">Singapore</ins>, Japan, GCC countries, etc.).</p>
<p>Another limitation may be the sensitive nature of corruption. In some countries/cultures, firms may not be comfortable answering questions on corruption. Although the data is collected under the context of confidentiality, firms may refuse to answer the question if they have been subject to bribery solicitations. Hence, in some countries, the actual incidence of this particular type of corruption may be higher than the calculated indicator value.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.c.

For all Enterprise Survey projects conducted since 2006, the resulting dataset has sampling weights. Hence the indicator value, which is computed using Stata, incorporates these sampling weights as well as the design strata.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.j.
