Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Definition:</ins></strong></p>
<p>The indicator provides the number of countries that have adopted and implemented investment promotion regimes for developing countries, including least developed countries.</p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p><u>Investment promotion regimes</u> can be defined as those instruments that directly aim at encouraging outward or inward foreign investment through particular measures of the home or host countries of investment. </p>
<p>Investment promotion regimes for LDCs are those instruments that <em>home countries</em> of investors have put in place to <em>encourage outward investment in LDCs directly or through measures intended for developing countries. </em></p>
<p><u>Home country</u> refers to donor countries that put in place investment promotion regimes to encourage outward investment in developing countries, including LDCs. </p>
<p><u>Foreign direct investment</u> involves a long-term relationship and reflects a lasting interest and control by a resident entity in one economy (foreign direct investor or parent enterprise) in an enterprise resident in an economy other than that of the foreign direct investor (FDI enterprise or affiliate enterprise or foreign affiliate).</p>
<p><u>Adoption</u> means that a country has put in place such a system i.e. through the formal adoption of a law, regulation or programme to encourage investment in developing countries, including LDCs. </p>
<p><u>Implementation</u> means that a country has actually started to promote individual investments in developing countries, including LDCs, on the basis of the relevant legislation. </p>
<p><u>Instruments</u> used under investment promotion regimes include investment guarantees, financial or fiscal support for outward investors as well as the conclusion of international investment agreements between the home and the host country of the investor. Besides these legal instruments, countries often also provide information and other advisory services for their outward investors. </p>
<p><u>Investment guarantee</u> is an insurance, offered by governments of the home country or other institutions, to investors to protect against certain political risks in host countries, such as the risk of discrimination, expropriation, transfer restrictions or breach of contract<u>.</u></p>
<p><u>International investment agreement</u> is a treaty between two or more countries regarding the promotion and protection of investments made by investors from one country in the other country&#x2019;s territory, which commits the host country government to grant certain standards of treatment and protection to foreign investors (nationals and companies of the other country) and their investments.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.f. Treatment of missing values (i) at country level and (ii) at regional level (IMPUTATION)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">&#x2022; At country level</ins></strong></p>
<p>When national data are missing, data may be obtained through Internet research globally. Numerous countries have a website that provides &#x2013; to the various extent &#x2013; information on national outward investment promotion regimes. These data would be verified with the national authorities.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">&#x2022; At regional and global levels</ins></strong></p>
<p>In order to calculate regional and global levels, missing data may be estimated using information from international sources (e.g. OECD and UNCTAD databases).</p>
<p> Such data may only be available in an aggregated form.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">5. Data availability and disaggregation (COVERAGE)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Data availability:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Currently, preliminary results for a UNCTAD pilot exercise consisting of a detailed questionnaire and a less detailed online questionnaire on existing outward investment promotion regimes for developing countries, including LDCs, are available. Replies have been received from five countries (on the detailed questionnaire) and from 26 countries on the shorter questionnaire. The answers received vary considerably in their degree of substance and detail. </p>
<p>Further data will be available on the government websites of home countries. In 2020, in-house internet research provided information on 19 countries.</p>
<p>Concerning international investment agreements, UNCTAD&#x2019;s database on this aspect is comprehensive and currently includes detailed information on over 3,300 treaties, including agreements concluded with or between LDCs. </p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Time series:</ins></strong></p>
<p>The data on international investment agreements comprehensively covers bilateral investment treaties, the main type of such agreements, signed from 1959 to 2020.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Disaggregation:</ins></strong></p>
<p>In the future, and to the extent that information is available, indicator 17.5.1 can be disaggregated by type of investment promotion regimes that home countries adopt for developing countries, including LDCs (e.g. investment guarantees, fiscal and financial aid, IIAs).</p>
<p>A geographical breakdown of the adoption of investment promotion schemes would also be possible. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">6. Comparability/deviation from international standards (COMPARABILITY)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Sources of discrepancies:</ins></strong></p>
<p>As mentioned above, countries have different outward investment promotion regimes in operation. Differences exist concerning: </p>
<p>&#x25CF; the specificity of the system (does it target exclusively investment in LDCs or investment in any developing country?);</p>
<p>&#x25CF; the type and number of investment promotion instruments (investment guarantees, fiscal or financial support, IIAs);</p>
<p>&#x25CF; the degree of investment promotion (how much support does the individual promotion measure provide?), and </p>
<p>&#x25CF; the actual impact of the investment promotion regime (how many investments have been made under the promotion regime and what effect do they have in the LDCs?).</p>
<p>Indicator 17.5.1 measures the number of countries that have an investment promotion regime in place for developing countries, including LDCs. Counting this number cannot provide a complete picture of the content and impact of these regimes. Likewise, it does not differentiate between countries with different types of regimes &#x2013; except for the distinction between countries that promote outward investment in LDCs through an LDC-specific promotion system and those with a more general promotion regime. Therefore, disaggregation of the indicator should be gradually increased as more data become available. Further work to measure the &#x201C;implementation&#x201D; of investment promotion regimes for developing countries, including LDCs, could be pursued in the longer-term.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">7.
