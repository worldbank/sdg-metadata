<p>The indicator provides the number of countries that have adopted and implemented investment promotion regimes for developing countries, including least developed countries<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;(LDCs)</ins>.</p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p><u>Investment promotion regimes</u> can be defined as those instruments that directly aim at encouraging outward or inward foreign investment through particular measures of the home or host countries of investment. </p>
<p>Investment promotion regimes for LDCs are those instruments that <em>home countries</em> of investors have put in place to <em>encourage outward investment in LDCs directly or through measures intended for developing countries. </em></p>
<p><u>Home country</u> refers to donor countries that put in place investment promotion regimes to encourage outward investment in developing countries, including LDCs. </p>
<p><u>Foreign direct investment</u> involves a long-term relationship and reflects a lasting interest and control by a resident entity in one economy (foreign direct investor or parent enterprise) in an enterprise resident in an economy other than that of the foreign direct investor (FDI enterprise or affiliate enterprise or foreign affiliate).</p>
<p><u>Adoption</u> means that a country has put in place such a system i.e. through the formal adoption of a law, regulation or programme to encourage investment in developing countries, including LDCs. </p>
<p><u>Implementation</u> means that a country has actually started to promote individual investments in developing countries, including LDCs, on the basis of the relevant legislation. </p>
<p><u>Instruments</u> used under investment promotion regimes include investment guarantees, financial or fiscal support for outward investors as well as the conclusion of international investment agreements between the home and the host country of the investor. Besides these legal instruments, countries often also provide information and other advisory services for their outward investors. </p>
<p><u>Investment guarantee</u> is an insurance, offered by governments of the home country or other institutions, to investors to protect against certain political risks in host countries, such as the risk of discrimination, expropriation, transfer restrictions or breach of contract<u>.</u></p>
<p><u>International investment agreement</u> is a treaty between two or more countries regarding the promotion and protection of investments made by investors from one country in the other country&#x2019;s territory, which commits the host country government to grant certain standards of treatment and protection to foreign investors (nationals and companies of the other country) and their investments.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">2.b.

Comment and limitations (REC_USE_LIM)</div></div></div><p>SDG indicator 17.5.1 calls for the measurement of both adoption and implementation of investment promotion regimes. The adoption of investment promotion regimes for LDCs is an important yet not sufficient means for strengthening the global partnership for the SGDs (Goal 17). Subsequent implementation of these regimes is necessary for making the tool effective. However, getting comprehensive and reliable data on the implementation stage (i.e. how many investments in LDCs have actually been promoted through the promotion regime?) will be difficult. These data are usually not publicly available. However, to some extent, data may exist in aggregate form (see below). </p>
<p>Furthermore, the <del class="diffmod">pilot</del><ins class="diffmod">UNCTAD</ins> <del class="diffmod">study</del><ins class="diffmod">research</ins> indicated that many developed countries and some emerging economies have national investment promotion regimes in place that encourage investment abroad. Usually, however, these promotion regimes are available for outward investment in any country &#x2013; not only for investment in LDCs or other developing economies. Some types of investment promotion tools can be more country-specific, like bilateral investment treaties<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;(BITs)</ins>. Therefore, indicator reporting<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;will be</del> started with preliminary estimates covering these types of investment promotion tools only.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">5. Data availability and disaggregation (COVERAGE)</div></div></div><p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>
<p>Currently, <del class="diffdel">preliminary </del>results <del class="diffmod">for</del><ins class="diffmod">are available based on</ins> a<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;UNCTAD pilot exercise consisting of a detailed questionnaire and a less</del> detailed online questionnaire on existing outward investment promotion regimes for developing countries, including LDCs<del class="diffdel">, are available</del>. Replies have been received from <del class="diffmod">five</del><ins class="diffmod">39</ins> countries<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;(on the detailed questionnaire) and from 26 countries on the shorter questionnaire</del>. The answers received vary considerably in their degree of substance and detail. </p>
<p>Further data will be available on the government websites of home countries. In <del class="diffmod">2020</del><ins class="diffmod">2021</ins>, in-house internet research provided information on <del class="diffmod">19</del><ins class="diffmod">17 additional</ins> countries.</p>
<p>Concerning international investment agreements, UNCTAD&#x2019;s database on this aspect is comprehensive and currently includes detailed information on over 3,300 treaties, including agreements concluded with or between LDCs. </p>
<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>
<p>The data on international investment agreements comprehensively covers bilateral investment treaties, the main type of such agreements, signed from 1959 to <del class="diffmod">2020</del><ins class="diffmod">2021</ins>.</p>
<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>
<p>In the future, and to the extent that information is available, indicator 17.5.1 can be disaggregated by type of investment promotion regimes that home countries adopt for developing countries, including LDCs (e.g. investment guarantees, fiscal and financial aid, IIAs).</p>
<p>A geographical breakdown of the adoption of investment promotion schemes would also be possible. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">7.
