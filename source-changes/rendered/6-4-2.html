Treatment of missing values (i) at country level and (ii) at regional level (IMPUTATION)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">&#x2022; At country level</ins></strong></p>
<p>Three types of imputation are made at country level to fill in missing years in the timeseries:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Linear imputation: between two available data-points</li>
  <li>Carry forward: after the last available data-points and up to 10 years</li>
  <li>Vertical imputation: in case of available total freshwater withdrawal but missing disaggregation by sources, and if existing disaggregation existed for previous years, the respective ratio by sources is applied to the available total.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">&#x2022; At regional and global levels</ins></strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the imputation methods at country level, data will be available for the whole time series (unless the latest official value was obtained more than 10 years ago). Imputed data is displayed with an appropriate qualifier</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.i.

  <li>During the reporting process, the OCS provides overall guidance, including on metadata reporting, based on the Metadata Dissemination Standard approved by the FAO IDWG-Statistics Technical Task Force.</li>
  <li>Data on Environmental flow requirements is re updated only when detailed methodology and metadata reprovided and when consistency in the values is ensured.</li>
  <li>After revision and validation, data are submitted to the OCS who also ensures the quality of the data and results.</li>

Data availability and disaggregation (COVERAGE)</div></div></div><p>Data needed for the indicator are collected through AQUASTAT for 168 countries worldwide. In the 2020 round, xx countries reported data. The indicators values for the rest of the countries are imputed as described in section 4.f.</p>
<p>Breakdown of the number of countries covered by region is as follows:</p>
<p>Countries (2010 to present):</p>
<p>Asia and Pacific 23</p>
<p>Africa 18</p>
<p>Latin America and the Caribbean 17</p>
<p>Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan 41</p>
<p>Countries (2000-2009):</p>
<p>Asia and Pacific 42</p>
<p>Africa 49</p>
<p>Latin America and the Caribbean 27</p>
<p>Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan 47</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Time series:</ins></strong></p>
<p>1961-2018 (Discontinuous, depending on country. Data are interpolated to create timelines.) </p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Disaggregation:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Although the indicator is based on total water volumes, sectoral data are needed to be able to disaggregate it in order to show the respective contribution of different sectors to the country&#x2019;s water stress, and therefore the relative importance of actions needed to contain water demand in the different sectors (agriculture, services and industry). </p>
<p>At national level, water resources and withdrawals are estimated or measured at the level of appropriate hydrological units (river basins, aquifers). It is therefore possible to obtain a geographical distribution of water stress by hydrological unit, thus allowing for more targeted response in terms of water demand management.</p></div>
