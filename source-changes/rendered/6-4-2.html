Rationale (RATIONALE)</div></div></div><p>The purpose of this indicator is to show the degree to which water resources are being exploited to meet the country&apos;s water demand. It measures a country&apos;s pressure on its water resources and therefore the challenge on the sustainability of its water use. It tracks progress <del class="diffmod">in regard to</del><ins class="diffmod">regarding</ins> &#x201C;withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity&#x201D;, i.e. the environmental component of target 6.4.</p>
<p>The indicator shows to what extent water resources are already used, and signals the importance of effective supply and demand management policies. It indicates the likelihood of increasing competition and conflict between different water uses and users in a situation of increasing water scarcity. Increased water stress, shown by an increase in the value of the indicator, has potentially negative effects on the sustainability of the natural resources and on economic development. On the other hand, low values of the indicator indicate that water does not represent a particular challenge for economic development and sustainability.</p>
<p>However, extremely low values may indicate the inability of a country to use properly its water resources for the benefit of the population. In such cases, a moderate and controlled increase in the value of the indicator can be a sign of positive development.</p>
<p>This indicator provides an estimate of pressure by all sectors on the country&#x2019;s renewable freshwater resources. A low level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors is marginal in relation to the resources, and has therefore little potential impact on the sustainability of the resources or on the potential competition between users. A high level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors represents a substantial share of the total renewable freshwater resources, with potentially larger impacts on the sustainability of the resources and potential situations of conflicts and competition between users.</p>
<p>The indicator is computed based on three components:</p>
<p><strong>Total renewable freshwater resources (TRWR)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Total freshwater withdrawal (TFWW)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Environmental flow requirements (EFR)</strong></p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.b. Comment and limitations (REC_USE_LIM)</div></div></div><p>Freshwater withdrawal as a percentage of renewable freshwater resources is a good indicator of pressure on limited water resources, one of the most important natural resources. However, it only partially addresses the issues related to sustainable water management. </p>
<p>Supplementary indicators that capture the multiple dimensions of water management would combine data on water demand management, behavioural changes with regard to water use and the availability of appropriate infrastructure, and measure progress in increasing the efficiency and sustainability of water use, in particular in relation to population and economic growth. They would also recognize the different climatic environments that affect water use in countries, <del class="diffmod">in particular</del><ins class="diffmod">especially</ins> in agriculture, which is the main user of water. Sustainability assessment is also linked to the critical thresholds fixed for this indicator. Although there is no universal consensus on such thresholds, a proposal is presented below.</p>
<p>Trends in freshwater withdrawal show relatively slow patterns of change. Usually, three-five years are a minimum frequency to be able to detect significant changes, as it is unlikely that the indicator would show meaningful variations from one year to the other. </p>
<p>Estimation of water withdrawal by sector may represent a limitation to the computation of the indicator. Few countries<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;actually</del> publish water withdrawal data on a regular basis by sector. </p>
<p>There is no universally agreed method for the computation of incoming freshwater flows originating outside of a country&apos;s borders. Nor is there any standard method to account for return flows, the part of the water withdrawn from its source and which flows back to the river system after use. In countries where return flow represents a substantial part of water withdrawal, the indicator tends to underestimate available water and therefore overestimate the level of water stress. </p>
<p>Other limitations that affect the interpretation of the water stress indicator include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>difficulty to obtain accurate, complete and up-to-date data; </li>
  <li>potentially large variation of sub-national data; </li>
  <li>lack of account of historical (e.g., due to climate change and population growth) and seasonal variations in water resources;</li>
  <li>lack of consideration to the distribution among water uses; </li>
  <li>lack of consideration of water quality and its suitability for use; and</li>
  <li>the indicator can be higher than 100 <del class="diffmod">per cent</del><ins class="diffmod">percent</ins> when water withdrawal non-renewable freshwater (fossil groundwater), when annual groundwater withdrawal is higher than annual replenishment (over-abstraction) or when freshwater withdrawal includes part or all<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;of</del> the water set aside for environmental flow requirements. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these issues can be solved through disaggregation of the indicator at the level of hydrological units and by distinguishing between different use sectors. However, due to the complexity of water flows, both within a country and between countries, care should be taken not to double-count.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.c. Method of computation (DATA_COMP)</div></div></div><p><strong>Computation Method:</strong></p>
<p>Method of computation: The indicator is computed as the total freshwater withdrawn (TFWW) divided by the difference between the total renewable freshwater resources (TRWR) and the environmental flow requirements (EFR), multiplied by 100. All variables are expressed in km<sup>3</sup>/year (10<sup>9</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/year).</p>

<p>Following the experience of the initial five years of application of the indicator, and consistent with the approach taken during the MDG program, the threshold of 25% has been identified as the upper limit for a full and unconditional safety of water stress as assessed by the indicator 6.4.2.</p>
<p>That means on one hand, that values below 25% can be considered safe in any instance (no stress); on the other, that values above 25% should be regarded as potentially and increasingly problematic, and should be qualified and/or reduced.</p>
<p>Above 25% of water stress, four classes have been identified to signal different levels of stress severity:</p>
<ul>
  <li>NO STRESS &lt;25% </li>
  <li>LOW 25% - 50% </li>
  <li>MEDIUM 50% - 75% </li>
  <li>HIGH 75-100%</li>

It is therefore possible to obtain a geographical distribution of water stress by hydrological unit, thus allowing for more targeted response in terms of water demand management.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">7.

<p>Several documents exist that can be used to support countries in the computation of this indicator. Among them:</p>
<p><strong>Understanding AQUASTAT - FAO&apos;s global water information system<br></strong>This information note covers a twenty-year history of the collection and analysis of water-related data and its dissemination as an international public good, freely available to all. The process of collecting and checking the data has resulted in the establishment of a unique network of collaborators who provide data, use data from other countries for comparative purposes, and exchange views and experiences on how best to measure and account for water-related use. Users range from international private companies to non-governmental organizations, and virtually all significant reports related to water depend on the data provided by AQUASTAT.<br><a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc817e.pdf">http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc817e.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong>Incorporating environmental flows into &#x201C;water stress&#x201D; indicator 6.4.2 - Guidelines for a minimum standard method for global reporting.</strong></p>
<p>These guidelines are intended to assist countries to participate in the assessment of SDG 6.4.2 on water stress by contributing data and information on environmental flows (EF). They provide a minimum standard method, principally based on the Global Environmental Flows Information System (GEFIS), which is accessible via <a href="http://eflows.iwmi.org">http://eflows.iwmi.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Global database on municipal wastewater production, collection, treatment, discharge and direct use in agriculture <br></strong>This paper describes the rationale and method to setup and feed the AQUASTAT database on municipal wastewater production, collection, treatment, discharge or direct use in agriculture. The best available sources of information have been reviewed, including peer-reviewed papers, proceedings of workshops, conferences and expert meetings, global or regional databases, as well as country briefs, national reports and direct communications by country government officials and experts<ins class="diffins">.</ins><br><a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc823e.pdf">http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc823e.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong>Cooling water for energy generation and its impact on national-level water statistics <br></strong>This technical note, describing the issue of cooling water for energy generation and its impact on national-level water statistics, has two purposes: 1) to act as a general informational resource and 2) to encourage governmental agencies responsible for water usage to gather and report information disaggregated by sub-sector (keeping thermoelectric withdrawals separate from industrial and hydroelectric withdrawals), and to determine the point at which lower water withdrawal designs are more favourable, even if the required capital cost is higher.<br><a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc822e.pdf">http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc822e.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong>Municipal and industrial water withdrawal modelling for the years 2000 and 2005 using statistical methods <br></strong>This document describes the efforts to generate models that estimate the municipal and industrial water withdrawals for the years 2000 and 2005. <br><a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc821e.pdf">http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc821e.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong>Disambiguation of water statistics <br></strong>The nomenclature surrounding water information is often confusing and gives rise to different interpretations and thus confusion. When discussing the way in which renewable water resources are utilized, the terms water use, usage, withdrawal, consumption, abstraction, extraction, utilization, supply and demand are often used without clearly stating what is meant. <br><a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc816e.pdf">http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc816e.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong>FAO-AQUASTAT questionnaire on water and agriculture</strong><br>These annual Guidelines and questionnaires have been prepared specifically designed to collect the SDG 6.4. related water variables, and therefore to update the core variables in AQUASTAT database.<br><a href="http://www.fao.org/aquastat/en/overview/methodology/">http://www.fao.org/aquastat/en/overview/methodology/</a></p><ins class="diffins">
