<p>All values represent the best estimates for the hepatitis B surface antigen indicator and aim to facilitate comparability across countries and over time. The estimates are not always the same as the official national estimates, because of the use of different methodologies and data sources. Estimates are provided for 194 WHO Member States. The analysis was carried out for the age groups 0-5 years and for the general population. Due to scarcity of data from some countries, the estimates are more robust at global and regional level than at country level, therefore, we suggest countries focus on the 95% Credible Intervals and not only on the reported point estimates. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A thorough and robust literature review was undertaken to find studies across the 194 WHO Member States and across age groups and vaccination status. We updated the systematic review by Schweitzer et al, 2015 that included a systematic search on articles published between Jan 1, 1965, and Oct 23, 2013. We updated the systematic search to include articles published between Oct 23, 2013, and October 30, 2018 in the databases Embase, PubMed, Global Index Medicus, Popline, and Web of Science. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For each country that had prevalence data, a weighted central position was calculated using the size and location of each study. For those countries with no data, we used the population centroid. Please see detailed explanation above. </p>

<p>Gather checklist of information that should be included in new reports of global health estimates. Gather promotes best practices in reporting health estimates. A range of health indicators are used to monitor population health and guide resource allocation throughout the world. But the lack of data for some regions and differing measurement methods present challenges that are often addressed by using statistical modelling techniques to generate coherent estimates based on often disparate sources of data. <a href="http://gather-statement.org/" target="_blank"><u><a href="http://gather-statement.org/&quot; \t &quot;_blank">http://gather-statement.org/</u></a> </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">5.

Comparability/deviation from international standards (COMPARABILITY)</div></div></div><p>This dataset represents the best estimates for the hepatitis B surface antigen indicator and aims to facilitate comparability across countries and over time. The estimates are not always the same as the official national estimates, because of the use of different methodologies and data sources e.g. special populations or populations at risk are not included in the hepatitis b seroprevalence model. Estimates are provided for 194 WHO Member States. The conditional autoregressive model uses data from well sampled countries to estimate prevalence in more data-poor countries taking account of effects such as sex, age and vaccination status. Due to scarcity of data from some countries, the estimates are more robust at global and regional level than at country level, therefore focus should be on the 95% Credible Intervals and not only on the reported point estimates.</p>

<p>Inclusion or exclusion criteria of the type of seroprevalence studies. Observational studies on chronic HBV infection seroprevalence (HBsAg prevalence), done in the general population or among blood donors, health-care workers (HCWs), and pregnant women were considered for inclusion. Studies were excluded if they were systematic reviews or meta-analyses, surveillance reports, case studies, letters or correspondence, or did not contain HBsAg seroprevalence data. Studies were also excluded if they exclusively reported prevalence estimates for high-risk population groups (e.g., migrants and refugees).</p></div>
