<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>At international level, data on intentional homicides are routinely collected and disseminated by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) through the annual UN<del class="diffdel">-Crime Trend</del> Survey <ins class="diffins">of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems </ins>(<ins class="diffins">UN-</ins>CTS) data collection. UNODC partners with regional organizations in the collection and dissemination of homicide data, respectively with Eurostat in Europe and with the Organisation of American States in the Americas. WHO collects data on intentional homicide in the framework of regular data collection on causes of death<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del>. In this context, data on deaths by assault are considered as intentional homicides.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.a. Rationale (RATIONALE)</div></div></div><p>This indicator is widely used at national and international level to measure the most extreme form of violent crime and it also provides a direct indication of lack of security. Security from violence is a pre-requisite for individuals to enjoy a safe and active life and for societies and economies to develop freely. Intentional homicides occur in all countries of the world and this indicator has a global applicability.</p>
<p>Monitoring intentional homicides is necessary to better assess their causes, drivers and consequences and, in the longer term, to develop effective preventive measures. If data are properly disaggregated (as suggested in the <del class="diffmod">ICCS</del><ins class="diffmod">International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes</ins>), the indicator can identify the different type of violence associated with homicide: inter-personal (including partner and family-related violence), crime (including organized crime and other forms of criminal activities) and socio-political (including terrorism, hate crime).</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.b. Comment and limitations (REC_USE_LIM)</div></div></div><p>The <ins class="diffins">International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (</ins>ICCS<ins class="diffins">)</ins> provides important clarifications on the definition of intentional homicide. In particular, it states that the following killings are included in the count of homicide:</p>
<p>- Murder</p>
<p>- Honour killing</p>
<p>- Serious assault leading to death</p>
<p>- Death as a result of terrorist activities</p>
<p>- Dowry-related killings</p>
<p>- Femicide</p>
<p>- Infanticide</p>
<p>- Voluntary manslaughter</p>
<p>- Extrajudicial killings</p>
<p>- Killings caused by excessive force by law enforcement/state officials</p>
<p>Furthermore, the <a href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/crime/ICCS/Unlawful_killings_conflict_situations_ICCS.pdf">ICCS<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;Briefing Note on Unlawful killings in conflict situations</ins></a> provides indications on how to distinguish between intentional homicides, killings directly related to war/conflict and other killings that amount to war crimes.</p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><ins class="diffins">The complete recording of homicide deaths in death-registration systems requires good linkages with coronial and police systems, but can be impeded by delays in determining intent of injury deaths. Less than one half of WHO Member States have well-functioning death-registration systems that record causes of death. </ins></p>
<p>The fact that homicide data are typically produced by two separate and independent sources at national level (criminal justice and public health) represents a specific asset of this indicator, as the comparison of the two sources is a tool to assess accuracy of national data. Usually, for countries where data from both sources exist, a good level of matching between the sources is recorded (see UNODC Global Study on Homicide, 2013).</p><del class="diffdel">
</del><p><del class="diffdel">Data on homicides produced by public health authorities are guided by the International classification of diseases (ICD-10), which provides a definition of &#x2018;Death by assault&#x2019; that is very close to the definition of intentional homicide of the ICCS.</del></p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.c.

For each regional aggregate, the number of victims of intentional homicides should correspond to the sum of all national data of such killings in the region, in each year. However, for many countries, data on intentional homicides are not available, or data are available only for some years. As a result, the sample of countries with available data is different for each year. If left unaddressed, this issue would result in inconsistencies, as regional aggregates would be drawn from a different set of countries each year.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Imputations for intentional homicides victims are performed on the country-level rate of intentional homicide victims per 100,000 population. If a country has just one available data point since the year 2000, all missing values are set equal to this single available data point. This approach therefore accounts for population growth over time and does not mean that the series is constant in absolute terms. If a country has two to eight available data points, the missing values between two data points are estimated by linear interpolation, and if there are missing values that are temporally before (or after) the earliest (or latest) available data point, the values at the beginning (or end) of the series are filled with the earliest (or latest) available data point. If a country has more than eight available data points in the respective time series, the missing values between two data points are estimated by linear interpolation, and if there are missing values that are temporally before (or after) the earliest (or latest) available data point, the values at the end of the time series are imputed using an exponential smoothing approach (for more information, see </ins><a href="https://afit-r.github.io/ts_exp_smoothing"><ins class="diffins">this page</ins></a><ins class="diffins">). Finally, the regional rate is applied to countries without any data point </ins></p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Once the series have been imputed at the national level, they are aggregated at the regional level. Regional homicide totals are calculated for each year by multiplying the regional homicide rate per 100,000 population with the total population of the respective region (divided by 100,000).

<p>- means of perpetration (firearm, <del class="diffmod">blunt</del><ins class="diffmod">sharp</ins> object, etc.)</p>
