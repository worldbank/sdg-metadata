Demographic surveillance sites and hospital data are excluded as they are <del class="diffmod">rarely</del><ins class="diffmod">not nationally</ins> representative. The preferred source of data is a civil registration system that records births and deaths on a continuous basis. If registration is complete and the system functions efficiently, the resulting estimates will be accurate and timely. However, many countries do not have well-functioning vital registration systems. In such cases household surveys, such as the UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the USAID-supported Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and periodic population censuses have become the primary sources of data on under-five and neonatal mortality. These surveys ask women about the survival of their children, and it is these reports that provide the basis of child mortality estimates for a majority of low- and middle-income countries. These data<del class="diffdel">, however,</del> are<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;often</del> subject to sampling <del class="diffdel">or/</del>and non-sampling errors, which might be substantial. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Civil registration </strong></p>
<p>Civil registration is the preferred data source for under-five, infant and neonatal mortality estimation. <del class="diffmod">The calculation of neonatal</del><ins class="diffmod">Neonatal</ins> mortality rates <del class="diffmod">is</del><ins class="diffmod">are</ins> <del class="diffmod">derived</del><ins class="diffmod">calculated</ins> <del class="diffmod">from</del><ins class="diffmod">using</ins> the number of neonatal deaths and the number of <ins class="diffins">live </ins>births over a period. For civil registration data<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;(with available data on the number of deaths and mid-year populations)</del>, initially annual observations were constructed for all observation years in a country. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Population census and household survey data </strong></p>
<p>The majority of survey data comes from the full birth history (FBH), whereby women are asked for the date of birth of each of their children, whether the child is still alive, and if not the age at death. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.c. Method of computation (DATA_COMP)</div></div></div><p>The UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) estimates are derived from nationally representative data from censuses, surveys or vital registration systems. The UN IGME does not use any covariates to derive its estimates (except in the case of neonatal mortality estimation, which incorporates the relatively more data-rich under-five mortality rate estimates in the modelling)<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del>. It only applies a curve fitting method to good-quality empirical data to derive trend estimates after data quality assessment. In most cases, the UN IGME estimates are close to the underlying data. The UN IGME aims to minimize the errors for each estimate, harmonize trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly assessed estimates. The UN IGME produces neonatal mortality rate estimates with a Bayesian spline regression model which models the ratio of neonatal mortality rate / (under-five mortality rate - neonatal mortality rate). Estimates of NMR are obtained by recombining the estimates of the ratio with the UN IGME-estimated under-five mortality rate. See the references for details. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the underlying data mentioned above, the most frequently used methods are as follows: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Civil registration: The neonatal mortality rate can be calculated from the number of children who died during the first 28 days of life and the number of <ins class="diffins">live </ins>births. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Censuses and surveys: Censuses and surveys often include questions on household deaths in the last 12 months, which can be used to calculate mortality estimates. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Surveys: A direct method is used based on a full birth history, a series of detailed questions on each child a woman has given birth to during her lifetime. Neonatal, post-neonatal, infant, child and under-five mortality estimates can be derived from the full birth history. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.f.

<p>UN IGME estimates are based on underlying empirical data.

<p> </p>
<p>To construct aggregate estimates of neonatal mortality before 1990, regional averages of mortality rates were used for country-years with missing information and weighted by the respective population in the country-year. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.h.

Comparability/deviation from international standards (COMPARABILITY)</div></div></div><p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong> </p>
<p>The UN IGME estimates are<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;derived</del> based on nationally representative data. Countries may use a single source as their official estimate or apply methods different from the UN IGME methods to derive official national estimates. The differences between the UN IGME estimates and national official estimates are usually not large if empirical data are high quality. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many countries lack a single source of high-quality data covering the last several decades, instead relying on multiple data sources to estimate mortality. Data from different sources require different calculation methods and may suffer from different errors, for example random errors in sample surveys or systematic errors due to misreporting. As a result, different surveys often yield widely different estimates of under-five mortality for a given time period and available data collected by countries are often inconsistent across sources. It is important to analyse, reconcile and evaluate all data sources simultaneously for each country. </p>
<p>Each new survey or data point must be examined in the context of all other sources, including previous data, and with respect to any sampling or non-sampling errors that may be present (such as misreporting of age and survivor selection bias; underreporting of child deaths is also common). UN IGME assesses the quality of underlying data sources and adjusts data when necessary. Furthermore, the latest data produced by countries often are not current estimates but refer to an earlier reference period. Thus, the UN IGME also <del class="diffmod">projects</del><ins class="diffmod">extrapolates</ins> estimates to a common reference year. </p>
<p>In order to reconcile these differences and take better account of the systematic biases associated with the various types of data inputs, the UN IGME has developed an estimation method to fit a smoothed trend curve to a set of observations and to extrapolate that trend to a defined time point. The UN IGME aims to minimize the errors for each estimate, harmonize trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly assessed estimates of child mortality. In the absence of error-free data, there will always be uncertainty around data and estimates. To allow for added comparability, the UN IGME generates such estimates with uncertainty bounds. Applying a consistent methodology also allows for comparisons between countries, despite the varied number and types of data sources. UN IGME applies a common methodology across countries and uses original empirical data from each country but does not report figures produced by individual countries using other methods, which would not be comparable to other country estimates. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">7.
