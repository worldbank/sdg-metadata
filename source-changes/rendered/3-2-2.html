Comment and limitations (REC_USE_LIM)</div></div></div><p>A civil registration system that continuously records all births and deaths in a population is the preferred source of high-quality underlying data on under-five mortality but these systems are not well developed in many low- and middle-income countries. Instead, household surveys and population censuses are the primary sources of underlying data in these countries. </p>
<p>The reliance on multiple data sources, i.e. surveys and census conducted several years apart <del class="diffmod">but</del><ins class="diffmod">and</ins> producing retrospective time series, can result in disparate mortality rates from different sources, sometimes referring to the same time period. Available data also suffer from sampling and nonsampling errors, including misreporting of age and sex, survivor selection bias, underreporting of child deaths, and recall errors as data are collected retrospectively. Further misclassifications can also impact <del class="diffdel">on </del>the accuracy of data, for example<ins class="diffins">,</ins> early neonatal deaths may be classified as stillbirths. Thus, simply comparing two country data points from different sources and drawing a line between them is not a technically sound way to assess levels and trends. Given varying levels of data quality across different sources, this sort of trend assessment will provide misleading results. Hence, the <ins class="diffins">United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (</ins>UN IGME<ins class="diffins">)</ins> fits a statistical model to these data that takes into account these various data sources to produce annualized estimates. </p>
<p>It is important to keep these challenges in mind when looking at available country data and also when discrepancies between country data and the UN IGME estimates are being discussed. The following</p>
<p>points are important to highlight:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The UN IGME aims to minimize the errors for each estimate, harmonize trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly assessed estimates of child mortality. Thus, UN IGME estimates are derived from country data. Notably, UN IGME assesses the quality of underlying data sources and adjusts data when necessary.</li>
  <li>National estimates may refer to an earlier calendar year than the UN IGME estimates. This is particularly the case where estimates from the most recent national survey are used as the national estimate, since the survey estimates derived from a birth history are retrospective and typically refer to a period before the year of the survey, which may be several years behind the target year for the UN IGME estimates. National estimates may also use a different combination of data sources, or different projection or calculation methods.</li>
  <li>In the absence of error-free data, there will always be uncertainty around data and estimates<del class="diffdel">, both national and internationally</del>. To allow for added comparability, the UN IGME generates<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;such</del> estimates with uncertainty bounds. When discussing the UN IGME estimates, it&#x2019;s important to look at the uncertainty ranges, which might be fairly wide in the case of some countries.</li>

Method of computation (DATA_COMP)</div></div></div><p>The <del class="diffmod">UN</del><ins class="diffmod">United Nations</ins> Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) estimates are derived from nationally representative data from censuses, surveys or vital registration systems. The UN IGME does not use any covariates to derive its estimates (except in the case of neonatal mortality estimation, which incorporates the relatively more data-rich under-five mortality rate estimates in the modelling). It only applies a curve fitting method to good-quality empirical data to derive trend estimates after data quality assessment. In most cases, the UN IGME estimates are close to the underlying data. The UN IGME aims to minimize the errors for each estimate, harmonize trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly assessed estimates. The UN IGME produces neonatal mortality rate <ins class="diffins">(NMR) </ins>estimates with a Bayesian spline regression model<ins class="diffins">,</ins> which models the ratio of neonatal mortality rate / (under-five mortality rate - neonatal mortality rate). Estimates of NMR are obtained by recombining the estimates of the ratio with the UN IGME-estimated under-five mortality rate. See the references for details. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the underlying data mentioned above, the most frequently used methods are as follows: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Civil registration: The neonatal mortality rate can be calculated from the number of children who died during the first 28 days of life and the number of live births. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Censuses and surveys: Censuses and surveys often include questions on household deaths in the last 12 months, which can be used to calculate mortality estimates. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Surveys: A direct method is used based on a full birth history, a series of detailed questions on each child a woman has given birth to during her lifetime. Neonatal, post-neonatal, infant, child and under-five mortality estimates can be derived from the full birth history. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.d.

Comparability/deviation from international standards (COMPARABILITY)</div></div></div><p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong> </p>
<p>The <ins class="diffins">United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (</ins>UN IGME<ins class="diffins">)</ins> estimates are based on nationally representative data. Countries may use a single source as their official estimate or apply methods different from the UN IGME methods to derive official national estimates. The differences between the UN IGME estimates and national official estimates are usually not large if empirical data are high quality. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many countries lack a single source of high-quality data covering the last several decades, instead relying on multiple data sources to estimate mortality. Data from different sources require different calculation methods and may suffer from different errors, for example random errors in sample surveys or systematic errors due to misreporting. As a result, different surveys often yield widely different estimates of under-five mortality for a given time period and available data collected by countries are often inconsistent across sources. It is important to analyse, reconcile and evaluate all data sources simultaneously for each country. </p>
<p>Each new survey or data point must be examined in the context of all other sources, including previous data, and with respect to any sampling or non-sampling errors that may be present (such as misreporting of age and survivor selection bias; underreporting of child deaths is also common). <ins class="diffins">The </ins>UN IGME assesses the quality of underlying data sources and adjusts data when necessary. Furthermore, the latest data produced by countries often are not current estimates but refer to an earlier reference period. Thus, the UN IGME also extrapolates estimates to a common reference year. </p>
<p>In order to reconcile these differences and take better account of the systematic biases associated with the various types of data inputs, the UN IGME has developed an estimation method to fit a smoothed trend curve to a set of observations and to extrapolate that trend to a defined time point. The UN IGME aims to minimize the errors for each estimate, harmonize trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly assessed estimates of child mortality. In the absence of error-free data, there will always be uncertainty around data and estimates. To allow for added comparability, the UN IGME generates such estimates with uncertainty bounds. Applying a consistent methodology also allows for comparisons between countries, despite the varied number and types of data sources. <ins class="diffins">The </ins>UN IGME applies a common methodology across countries and uses original empirical data from each country but does not report figures produced by individual countries using other methods, which would not be comparable to other country estimates. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">7.
