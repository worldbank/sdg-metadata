Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Definition: </ins></strong></p>
<p>This indicator conveys the proportion of youth (aged 15-24 years) not in education, employment or training (also known as &quot;the youth NEET rate&quot;). </p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Concepts: </ins></strong></p>
<p>For the purposes of this indicator, youth is defined as all persons between the ages of 15 and 24 (inclusive). According to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), education is defined as organized and sustained communication designed to bring about learning. Formal education is defined in ISCED as education that is institutionalized, intentional, and planned through public organizations and recognized private bodies and, in their totality, make up the formal education system of a country. </p>
<p>Non-formal education, like formal education is defined in ISCED as education that is institutionalized, intentional and planned by an education provider but is considered an addition, alternative and/or a complement to formal education. It may be short in duration and/or low in intensity and it is typically provided in the form of short courses, workshops or seminars. Informal learning is defined in ISCED as forms of learning that are intentional or deliberate, but not institutionalized. It is thus less organized and less structured than either formal or non-formal education. Informal learning may include learning activities that occur in the family, in the work place, in the local community, and in daily life, on a self-directed, family-directed or socially-directed basis. For the purposes of this indicator, persons will be considered in education if they are in formal or non-formal education, as described above, but excluding informal learning. </p>
<p>Employment is defined as all persons of working age who, during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. </p>
<p>For the purpose of this indicator, persons are considered to be in training if they are in a non-academic learning activity through which they acquire specific skills intended for vocational or technical jobs. </p>
<p>Vocational training prepares trainees for jobs that are based on manual or practical activities, and for skilled operative jobs, both blue and white collar related to a specific trade, occupation or vocation. Technical training on the other hand imparts learning that can be applied in intermediate-level jobs, in particular those of technicians and middle managers. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.f. Treatment of missing values (i) at country level and (ii) at regional level (IMPUTATION)</div></div></div><ul>
  <li><strong><ins class="mod">At country level </ins></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Multivariate regression and cross-validation techniques are used to impute missing values at the country level. The additional variables used for the imputation include a range of indicators, including labour market and school enrolment data. However, the imputed missing country values are only used to calculate the global and regional estimates; they are not used for international reporting on the SDG indicators by the ILO. </p>

<p>For further information on the estimates, please refer to the ILO modelled estimates methodological overview, available at https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/ilo-modelled-estimates/</p>

</ins><p>Data for this indicator is available for 157 countries and territories.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Time series: </ins></strong></p>
<p>Country data for this indicator is available as of 2000 in the SDG Indicators Global Database, but longer time series are available in ILOSTAT. Regional data in this submission covers a period of 2005 to 2019.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Disaggregation:</ins></strong></p>
<p>No disaggregation is specifically required for this indicator, although having it disaggregated by sex is desirable, as is disaggregation by detailed age groups within the youth age band. </p>
