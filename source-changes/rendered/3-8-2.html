Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
<p>Proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income. Two thresholds are used to define &#x201C;large household expenditure on health&#x201D;: greater than 10% and greater than 25% of total household expenditure or income.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p>Indicator 3.8.2 is defined as the &#x201C;Proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income&#x201D;. In effect<ins class="diffins">,</ins> it is based on a ratio exceeding a threshold. The two main concepts of interest behind this ratio are household expenditure on health (numerator) and total household consumption expenditure or, when unavailable, income (denominator). </p>
<p><strong><em>Numerator</em></strong></p>
<p>Household expenditure on health is defined as any expenditure incurred at the time<del class="diffmod">-</del><ins class="diffmod">&nbsp;</ins>of<del class="diffmod">-</del><ins class="diffmod">&nbsp;</ins>service use to get any type of care (promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long-term care)<ins class="diffins">,</ins> including all medicines, vaccines and other pharmaceutical preparations<ins class="diffins">,</ins> as well as all health products, <em>from any type of provider and for all members of the household</em>. These health expenditures are characterized by direct payments that are financed by a household&#x2019;s income (including remittances), savings or loans <strong>but do not include any third-party payer reimbursement. </strong>They are labelled Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) payments in the classification of health care financing schemes (HF) of the <del class="diffmod">international</del><ins class="diffmod">International</ins> Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA). They are the most <del class="diffmod">unequitable</del><ins class="diffmod">inequitable</ins> source of funding for the health system as they are solely based on the willingness and ability to pay of the household; they only grant access to the health services and health products individuals can pay for, without any solidarity between the healthy and the sick beyond the household<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[1]</a></sup></sup>, the rich and the poor; they represent a barrier to access for those people who are unable to find the economic resources need to pay out of their own pocket. </p>
<p>The components of household expenditure on health should be consistent with division 06 on <ins class="diffins">the </ins>health of the UN Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP) on medicines and medical products (06.1), outpatient care services (06.2)<ins class="diffins">,</ins> inpatient care services (06.3) and other health services (06.4)<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[2]</a></sup></sup>.</p>
<p>Further information on definitions and classifications of health expenditures should be consistent with the <a href="http://www.who.int/health-accounts/methodology/en/"><u><del class="diffmod">international</del><ins class="diffmod">International</ins> <del class="diffmod">classification</del><ins class="diffmod">Classification</ins> for <del class="diffmod">health</del><ins class="diffmod">Health</ins> <del class="diffmod">accounts</del><ins class="diffmod">Accounts</ins></u></a><u> (ICHA)</u> and its family of classifications (for example<ins class="diffins">,</ins> by type of provider). </p>
<p><strong><em>Denominator</em></strong></p>
<p>Expenditure on household consumption and household income are both monetary welfare measures. Household consumption is a function of permanent income, which is a measure of a household&#x2019;s long-term economic resources that determine living standards. Consumption is generally defined as the sum of the monetary values of all items consumed by the household on <ins class="diffins">a </ins>domestic account during a <ins class="diffins">common </ins>reference period<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><ins class="mod"><ins class="diffins">[3]</ins></a></sup>. It includes monetary expenditures on food and non-food non-durable goods and services consumed as well as the imputed values of goods and services that are not purchased but procured otherwise for consumption (value of in-kind consumption); the value use of durables, and the value use of owner-occupied housing. Information on household consumption is usually collected in household surveys that may use different approaches to measure &#x2018;consumption&#x2019; depending on whether items refer to durable or non-durable goods and/or are directly produced by households.</p>
<p>The most relevant measure of income is disposable income<ins class="diffins">,</ins> as it is close to the maximum available to the household for consumption expenditure during the accounting period. Disposable income is defined as total income less direct taxes (net of refunds), compulsory fees and fines. Total income is generally composed of income from employment, property income, income from household production of services for own consumption, transfers received in cash and goods, and transfers received as services<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5">[<del class="diffmod">3</del><ins class="diffmod">4</ins>]</a></sup></sup>. </p>
<p>Income is more difficult to measure accurately due to its greater variability over time. Consumption is less variable over time and easier to measure. <del class="diffmod">It</del><ins class="diffmod">Therefore, it</ins> is<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;therefore</del> recommended that whenever there is information on <del class="diffdel">both </del>household consumption and income<ins class="diffins">,</ins> the former is used (see the &#x201C;comments and limitations&#x201D; section to learn more about the sensitivity of 3.8.2 to the income/expenditure choice in the denominator). Statistics on 3.8.2 currently produced by WHO and the World Bank predominantly rely on consumption (see <ins class="diffins">the </ins>section on data sources). </p>
<p><strong><em>Thresholds</em></strong></p>
<p>Two thresholds are used for global reporting to identify large household expenditure on health as<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;a</ins> share of total household consumption or income<u>: </u><strong><u>a lower threshold of 10% (3.8.2_10) and a higher threshold of 25% (3.8.2_25)</u></strong>. With these two thresholds<ins class="diffins">,</ins> the indicator measures financial hardship </p><del class="diffdel">

The most important criterion for selecting a data source to measure SDG indicator 3.8.2 is the availability of both household consumption expenditure on health and total household consumption expenditures.</p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup class="footnote-number" id="footnote-6"><del class="diffmod">4</del><ins class="diffmod">5</ins></sup><p> <a href="http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf">http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf</a> <a href="#footnote-ref-6">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">3.b. Data collection method (COLL_METHOD)</div></div></div><p><ins class="diffins">The World Health Organizaiton (</ins>WHO<ins class="diffins">)</ins> and the World Bank contact Ministries of Health and/or National statistical offices for two purposes: a) request access to the household survey microdata in order to produce SDG indicator 3.8.2; b) request estimates produced by the country itself. </p>
<p>A) The first type of request is done by each organization separately. WHO obtains access to the household survey microdata from national statistical offices through its regional offices or country offices. <del class="diffmod">Access</del><ins class="diffmod">The access</ins> request is often part of technical assistance programs on health financing issues.</p>
<p>The World Bank also typically receives data from National Statistical Offices (NSOs) directly. In other cases, it uses NSO data received indirectly. For example, it receives data from Eurostat and <del class="diffdel">from </del>LIS (Luxembourg Income Study), <del class="diffmod">who</del><ins class="diffmod">which</ins> provide the World Bank NSO data in its original form or harmonized for comparability. The Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina and the World Bank jointly maintain the SEDLAC (Socio-Economic Database for Latin American and Caribbean) database that includes harmonized statistics on poverty and other distributional and social variables from 24 Latin American and Caribbean countries, based on microdata from household surveys conducted by NSOs. Data is obtained through country<del class="diffmod">&nbsp;</del><ins class="diffmod">-</ins>specific programs, including technical assistance programs and joint analytical and capacity<del class="diffmod">&nbsp;</del><ins class="diffmod">-</ins>building activities. The World Bank has relationships with NSOs on work programs involving statistical systems and data analysis. Poverty economists from the World Bank typically engage with NSOs broadly on poverty measurement and analysis as part of technical assistance activities. </p>
<p>The World Health Organization and the World Bank regularly undertake training events on the measurement of lack of financial protection coverage to produce SDG 3.8.2 indicator. This type of activity involves participants from the Ministry of Health as well as from the National Statistical Office. </p>
<p>All the country-year estimates produced by both organizations are assembled in a joint database following a quality assessment process (see section 4.j). Such estimates are included in a country consultation conducted to give an opportunity to i) review the estimates, the data sources and the methods used for computation; ii) provide information about additional data sources; iii) build <ins class="diffins">a </ins>mutual understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of available data and ensure broad ownership of the results; and iv) request estimates produced by the country as further explained hereafter.</p>
<p>B) Estimates produced by each country are requested through a country consultation conducted by the World Health Organization. Following the WHO Executive Board resolution (EB107.R8), this process starts with WHO sending a formal request to ministries of health to nominate a focal point for the consultation. WHO sends draft estimates and methodological descriptions to them, copying countries&#x2019; focal <del class="diffmod">point</del><ins class="diffmod">points</ins> for SDG reporting where nominated at the request of <del class="diffmod">UNSD</del><ins class="diffmod">the UN Statistics Division</ins>. <del class="diffmod">STATA codes</del><ins class="diffmod">Codes</ins> are available to reproduce the estimates shared. The focal points then send to WHO their comments, often including new data or revised country estimates that are used to update the country estimates. Estimates produced by the countries are subject to the same quality assessment process and included in the joint database if they are not flagged in consumption or <del class="diffdel">in </del>the health budget share (see section 4.j).</p>

Indicator 3.8.2 is about identifying people with out-of-pocket health spending on health exceeding their ability to pay, which might lead to cutting spending on other basic needs such as education, food, housing and utilities. Reducing financial hardship in health is important on the global development agenda as well as a priority of the health sector of many countries across all regions.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.b. Comment and limitations (REC_USE_LIM)</div></div></div><p>It is feasible to monitor indicator 3.8.2 on a regular basis using the same household survey data that is used to monitor SDG <del class="diffmod">target</del><ins class="diffmod">targets</ins> 1.1 and 1.2 on poverty<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7">[<del class="diffmod">5</del><ins class="diffmod">6</ins>]</a></sup></sup>. These surveys are also regularly conducted for other purposes<ins class="diffins">,</ins> such as calculating weights for the Consumer Price Index. These surveys are <del class="diffmod">conducted</del><ins class="diffmod">typically</ins> <del class="diffmod">typically</del><ins class="diffmod">undertaken</ins> by <ins class="diffins">National Statistical Offices (</ins>NSOs<ins class="diffins">)</ins>. Thus, monitoring the proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health as a share of total household consumption or income does not add any additional data collection burden so long as the health expenditure component of the household non-food consumption data can be identified. While this is an advantage, indicator 3.8.2 suffers from the same challenges of timeliness, frequency, data quality and comparability of surveys <del class="diffmod">than</del><ins class="diffmod">as</ins> SDG indicator 1.1.1. However, indicator 3.8.2 has its own conceptual and empirical limitations.</p>
<p>First, challenges to track out-of-pocket health spending (numerator): indicator 3.8.2 attempts to identify financial hardship that individuals face when using their income, savings or taking loans to pay for health care. However, most household surveys fail to identify the source of funding used by a household <del class="diffmod">who</del><ins class="diffmod">that</ins> is reporting health expenditure. In countries where there is no retrospective reimbursement of household spending on health<ins class="diffins">,</ins> this is not a problem. If a household does report any expenditure on health, it would be because it <del class="diffmod">is</del><ins class="diffmod">will</ins> not<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;going to</del> be reimbursed by any third-party payer. It is<ins class="diffins">,</ins> therefore<ins class="diffins">,</ins> consistent with the definition given for direct health care payments (the numerator). </p><del class="diffdel">
</del><p>For those countries<ins class="diffins">,</ins> on the other hand<ins class="diffins">,</ins> where there is retrospective reimbursement &#x2013; for example, via a contributory health insurance scheme - the amount reported by a household on health expenditures might be totally or partially reimbursed at some later point, perhaps outside the recall period of the household survey. </p>
<p>Clearly, more work is needed to ensure that survey instruments gather information on the sources of funding used by the household to pay for health care<del class="diffdel">,</del> or<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;that</ins> the household survey instrument always specifies that health expenditures should be net of any reimbursement. <del class="diffmod">Survey</del><ins class="diffmod">The survey</ins> instrument and sample design should also be carefully reviewed to minimize measurement errors due to both non-sampling errors such as<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;a</del> very short or very long recall periods precluding proper data collection of all health care components (overnight stay, medicines, etc.<del class="diffdel">.</del>); or sampling errors such as over-sample of areas with a particularly low burden of disease.</p>
<p>Second,<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;the</ins> sensitivity of the indicator to the choice of the welfare metric for disaggregation (consumption or income in the denominator): in the current definition of indicator 3.8.2<ins class="diffins">,</ins> large health expenditures can be identified by comparing how much household spend on health to either household income or total household expenditure. Expenditure is the recommended measure of <ins class="diffins">a </ins>household&#x2019;s resources (see concept section)<ins class="diffins">,</ins> but recent empirical work has demonstrated that while statistics on 3.8.2 at<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;the</ins> country level are fairly robust to such choice, their disaggregation by income group is pretty sensitive to it. Income<del class="diffmod">&nbsp;</del><ins class="diffmod">-</ins>based measures show a greater concentration of the proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health among the poor than expenditure<del class="diffmod">&nbsp;</del><ins class="diffmod">-</ins>based measures (see <del class="diffmod">chapter</del><ins class="diffmod">Chapter</ins> 2 in the WHO and World Bank 2017 report on tracking universal health coverage as well as Wagstaff et al<ins class="diffins">.</ins> 2018)<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del>.</p>
<p>Third, cut-off values to identify large health expenditures: indicator 3.8.2. relies on a single cut-off point to identify what constitutes &#x2018;large health expenditure as a share of total household expenditure or income&#x2019;. People just below such threshold are not taken into account, which is always the problem with measures based on cut-offs. This is simply avoided by plotting the cumulative distribution function of the health expenditure ratio behind 3.8.2. By doing so, it is possible to identify for any threshold the proportion of the population that is devoting any share of its household&#x2019;s budget to health. </p>
<p>Fourth, there are other indicators used to measure financial hardship, all based on the same data sources<del class="diffmod">:</del><ins class="diffmod">.</ins> The current definition of SDG indicator 3.8.2 is based on methodologies dating back to the 1990s developed in collaboration with academics at the World Bank and the World Health Organization<ins class="diffins">.</ins> <del class="diffmod">and</del><ins class="diffmod">It</ins> corresponds to an indicator of the incidence of catastrophic health spending using a budget share approach (see references). In addition to <ins class="diffins">SDG </ins>indicator 3.8.2, WHO also defines large health expenditure in relation to non-subsistence spending<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8">[<del class="diffdel">6]</del></a></sup><del class="diffdel">,</del><a href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8"><ins class="mod"><del class="diffdel">[</del>7]</a></sup>,<sup><a href="#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9">[8<ins class="diffins">]</ins></a></sup><ins class="diffins">,</ins><sup><a href="#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10"><ins class="mod"><ins class="diffins">[9</ins>]</a></sup>,</sup> and both WHO and the World Bank use indicators of impoverishing health spending to assess to what extent OOP health spending deters efforts to &#x201C;End poverty in all its form everywhere&#x201D; (SDG 1). </p>
<p>Fifth, <ins class="diffins">SDG </ins>indicator 3.8.2. needs to be tracked jointly with SDG indicator 3.8.1<ins class="diffins">,</ins> as well as indicators of barriers to access<del class="diffmod">:</del><ins class="diffmod">.</ins> Two indicators have been chosen to monitor target 3.8 on Universal Health Coverage within the SDG framework. <del class="diffmod">Indicator</del><ins class="diffmod">SDG indicator</ins> 3.8.1 is for the health service coverage dimension of <ins class="diffins">universal health coverage (</ins>UHC<ins class="diffins">),</ins> and <del class="diffmod">Indicator</del><ins class="diffmod">SDG indicator</ins> 3.8.2 <del class="diffmod">to track</del><ins class="diffmod">tracks</ins> the financial protection dimensions. These two indicators should <ins class="diffins">always </ins>be<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;always</del> monitored jointly. Indeed, some of the people seeking care face barriers to access related to financial constraints, acceptability issues, unavailability of services, or accessibility. Those unable to overcome such barriers (financial and non-financial ones) will not report any spending on health<ins class="diffins">,</ins> which will tend to reduce SDG<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;indicator</ins> 3.8.2 rates. When this happens, SDG<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;indicator</ins> 3.8.1 levels should also be low as the tracer indicators of service coverage should reflect that large fractions of the population are unable to get the services they <del class="diffmod">needed</del><ins class="diffmod">need</ins>. But specific indicators on barriers to access ought to be tracked to understand which type of barriers is precluding access to needed services. </p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup class="footnote-number" id="footnote-7"><del class="diffmod">5</del><ins class="diffmod">6</ins></sup><p> <a href="http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf">http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf</a> <a href="#footnote-ref-7">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class="footnote-number" id="footnote-8"><del class="diffmod">6</del><ins class="diffmod">7</ins></sup><p> Chapter 2 in &#x201C;Tracking universal health coverage: 2017 global monitoring report&#x201D;, World Health Organization and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/ The World Bank; 2017; <a href="http://www.who.int/healthinfo/indicators/2015/en/">http://www.who.int/healthinfo/indicators/2015/en/</a> ; <a href="#footnote-ref-8">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class="footnote-number" id="footnote-9"><del class="diffmod">7</del><ins class="diffmod">8</ins></sup><p>Xu, K., Evans, D.
