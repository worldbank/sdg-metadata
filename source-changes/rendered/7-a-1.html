<p>IRENA: The flows covered by IRENA are defined as all additional loans, grants and equity investments received by developing countries (defined as countries in developing regions, as listed in the UN M49 composition of regions) from all foreign governments, multilateral agencies and additional development finance institutions (including export credits, where available) for the purpose of clean energy research and development and renewable energy production, including in hybrid systems. These additional flows cover the same technologies and other activities (research and development, technical assistance, etc.) as listed above and exclude all flows extracted from the OECD/DAC CRS.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">2.b.

<p>IRENA&#x2019;s data on financial flows from public sources in support of renewable energy are available in IRENA&#x2019;s Public Renewable Energy Investment Database.

<p>In order to achieve this overarching objective, the Committee shall:</p>
<p><del class="diffmod">a) </del><ol><ins class="diffmod">
  </ins><li>monitor, assess, report, and promote the provision of resources that support sustainable development by collecting and analysing data and information on ODA and other official and private flows, in a transparent way.</p></li><ins class="diffmod">
</ins></ol>
<p>With a mandate from countries around the world, IRENA encourages governments to adopt enabling policies for renewable energy investments, provides practical tools and policy advice to accelerate renewable energy deployment, and facilitates knowledge sharing and technology transfer to provide clean, sustainable energy for the world&#x2019;s growing population. Collecting official statistics (including international public finance flows) is in line with these aims. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.a.

The additional flows (from the IRENA database) capture the flows to non-ODA Recipients in developing regions, flows from countries and institutions not currently reporting to the DAC and certain other types of flows, such as export credits. </p>
<p>Energy access is a major development constraint in many developing countries and, while starting from a relatively low base, energy demand is expected to grow very rapidly in many of these countries in the future. This presents an opportunity for developing countries to utilize clean and renewable technologies to meet their future energy needs if they can gain access to the appropriate technologies and expertise. This indicator provides a suitable measure of the international support given to developing countries to access these technologies.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.c.

<p>The CRS contains flows to all DAC recipient countries. Global and regional figures are based on the sum of ODA and OOF flows to the renewable energy projects.</p>
<p>IRENA currently includes data about renewable energy projects in <del class="diffmod">29</del><ins class="diffmod">41</ins> developed countries and <del class="diffmod">104</del><ins class="diffmod">109</ins> developing countries (<del class="diffmod">133</del><ins class="diffmod">150</ins> countries overall).</p>
<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>
<p>OECD: annual data from 1960 onwards (see above). </p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p>IRENA: annual data from 2000 onwards.</p>
<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>
<p>Data in the CRS contain markers which reflect whether a policy objective is attained through the activity. Measuring gender equality is included in the CRS. Data from the CRS are reported at the project level and can be disaggregated by type of flow (ODA or OOF), by donor, recipient country, type of finance, type of aid (project, agriculture sub-sector, etc.).</p>
<p>Data in IRENA are stored by country (source and recipient) at the project-level, allowing disaggregation of the data in several dimensions. For example, financial flows can be divided by technologies (i.e. bioenergy, geothermal energy, hydropower, <del class="diffmod">ocean</del><ins class="diffmod">marine</ins> energy, solar energy, and wind energy) and sub-technologies (e.g. onshore and offshore wind), by geography (both at the country and regional level), by financial instrument and by type of recipient.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">0.d.
