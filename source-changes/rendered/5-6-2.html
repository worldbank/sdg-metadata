<p>Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Indicator 5.6.2 seeks to measure the extent to which countries have national laws and regulations that guarantee full and equal access to women and men aged 15 years and older to sexual and reproductive health care, information and education. </p>
<p>The indicator is a percentage (%) scale of 0 to 100 (national laws and regulations exist to guarantee full and equal access), indicating a country&#x2019;s status and progress in the existence of such national laws and regulations. Indicator 5.6.2 measures only the existence of laws and regulations; it does not measure their implementation. </p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Concepts:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Laws: laws and statutes are official rules of conduct or action prescribed, or formally recognized as binding, or enforced by a controlling authority that governs the behavior of actors (including people, corporations, associations, government agencies). They are adopted or ratified by the legislative branch of government and may be formally recognized in the Constitution or interpreted by courts. Laws governing sexual and reproductive health are not necessarily contained in one law. </p>
<p>Regulations: are considered to be executive, ministerial or other administrative orders or decrees. At the municipal level, regulations are sometimes called ordinances. Regulations and ordinances issued by governmental entities have the force of law, although circumscribed by the level of the issuing authority. Under this methodology, only regulations with national-level application are considered. </p>
<p>Restrictions: many laws and regulations contain restrictions in the scope of their applicability. Such restrictions, which include, though are not limited to, those by age, sex, marital status, and requirement for third party authorization, represent barriers to full and equal access to sexual and reproductive health care, information and education. </p>
<p>Plural legal systems: are defined as legal systems in which multiple sources of law co-exist. Such legal systems have typically developed over a period of time as a consequence of colonial inheritance, religion and other socio-cultural factors. Examples of sources of law that might co-exist under a plural legal system include: English common law, French civil or other law, statutory law, and customary and religious law. The co-existence of multiple sources of law can create fundamental contradictions in the legal system, which result in barriers to full and equal access to sexual and reproductive health care, information and education. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Guarantee&#x201D; (access): for the purpose of this methodology, &#x201C;guarantee&#x201D; is understood in relation to a law or regulation that assures a particular outcome or condition. The methodology recognizes that laws can only guarantee &#x201C;in principle&#x201D;; for the outcomes to be fully realized in practice, additional steps, including policy and budgetary measures will need to be in place.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.f.

<p>No imputation will be made for a country with missing data. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">&#x2022; At regional and global levels:</ins></strong></p>
<p>No imputation will be made at regional and global levels. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">5. Data availability and disaggregation (COVERAGE)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Data availability:</ins></strong></p>
<p>107 countries have complete or partial data for indicator 5.6.2, covering 75 percent of the world&#x2019;s population. A total of 75 countries have complete data, allowing calculation of data for indicator 5.6.2. </p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Time series:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Not applicable</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Disaggregation:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Data will be disaggregated by section and component. This will enable countries to identify the particular areas of sexual and reproductive health care, information and education in which progress is required. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">6.
