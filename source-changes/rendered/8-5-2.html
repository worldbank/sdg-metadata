</del><p>The preferred official national data source for this indicator is a household-based labour force survey. </p>
<p>In the absence of a labour force survey, a population census and/or other type of household surveys with an appropriate employment module may also be used to obtain the required data. It is important to note that unemployment data derived from employment office records or unemployment registers would not refer to unemployment (as defined for the purposes of this indicator, using the three-criteria of being without a job, seeking employment and available for employment) but to registered unemployment, and thus, it would not be comparable with indicator 8.5.2. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.f.

  <li><strong><ins class="mod">At country level </ins></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Multivariate regression techniques are used to impute missing values at the country level. However, the imputed missing country values are only used to calculate the global and regional estimates; they are not used for international reporting on the SDG indicators by the ILO. </p>
<p>For further information on the estimates, please refer to the the ILO modelled estimates methodological overview, available at https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/TEM.pdf</p>

<p>Data disaggregated by sex and age for this indicator is available for 186 countries and territories. The indicator is widely available based on real observations provided by countries and derived from national labour force surveys, other types of household surveys or population census. </p>
<p>However, the disaggregation by disability is not widely available and this submission only includes 68 countries and territories. It is increasingly reported but coverage is still very low. </p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Time series:</ins></strong><br>Data for disaggregation by sex and age for this indicator is available as of 2000 until 2019 for countries in the SDG Indicators Global Database, but time series going back further are available in ILOSTAT. 2020 regional aggregates are available for total population. </p>
<p>Data for disaggregation by disability status is available for the period from 2005 to 2019. </p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Disaggregation:</ins></strong></p>
<p>This indicator should, ideally, be disaggregated by sex, age group and disability status. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">6. Comparability/deviation from international standards (COMPARABILITY)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Sources of discrepancies:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Differences in the questionnaires used in the household surveys as the basic measurement tool may entail differences in specific definitions of employment and unemployment, differences in the treatment of specific groups or differences in the operational criteria used to determine the individual&#x2019;s labour force status.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate is dependent on the geographical coverage of the survey since urban and rural areas tend to have significant differences in the incidence of unemployment. It is important to note that unemployment indicators do not convey any information on the characteristics of the unemployed (their education level, ethnic origin, socio-economic background, work experience, duration of unemployment, etc.), which is crucial to cast light on labour market failures.</p></div>
