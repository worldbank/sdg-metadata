Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><p><strong>Definition:</strong> </p>
<p>The unemployment rate conveys the percentage of persons in the labour force who are unemployed. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong> </p>
<p>Unemployed persons are defined as all those of working age (usually aged 15 and above) who were not in employment, carried out activities to seek employment during a specified recent period and were currently available to take up employment given a job opportunity, where: (a) &#x201C;not in employment&#x201D; is assessed with respect to the short reference period for the measurement of employment; (b) to &#x201C;seek employment&#x201D; refers to any activity when carried out, during a specified recent period comprising the last four weeks or one month, for the purpose of finding a job or setting up a business or agricultural undertaking; (c) the point when the enterprise starts to exist should be used to distinguish between search activities aimed at setting up a business and the work activity itself, as evidenced by the enterprise&#x2019;s registration to operate or by when financial resources become available, the necessary infrastructure or materials are in place or the first client or order is received, depending on the context; (d) &#x201C;currently available&#x201D; serves as a test of readiness to start a job in the present, assessed with respect to a short reference period comprising that used to measure employment (depending on national circumstances, the reference period may be extended to include a short subsequent period not exceeding two weeks in total, so as to ensure adequate coverage of unemployment situations among different population groups). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Persons in employment are defined as all those of working age (usually aged 15 and above) who, during a short reference period such as one week or one day, were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. <ins class="diffins">The difference between the 13th and 19th ICLS series for a given country is the operational criteria used to define employment, with two series based on the statistical standards from the 13th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) and the other two series based on 19th ICLS standards. In the 19th ICLS series, employment is defined more narrowly as work done for pay or profit, while activities not done mainly in exchange for remuneration (i.e., own-use production work, volunteer work and unpaid trainee work) are recognized as other forms of work.</ins></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The labour force corresponds to the sum of persons in employment and in unemployment. </p>
<p>For more information on the definitions of employment and unemployment refer to the Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization Adopted by the 19<sup>th</sup> International Conference of Labour Statisticians. </p>

The unemployment estimates derived from the ILO modelled estimates are used to produce global and regional estimates on unemployment rates.

Comparability/deviation from international standards (COMPARABILITY)</div></div></div><p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>
<p>Differences in the questionnaires used in the household surveys as the basic measurement tool may entail differences in specific definitions of employment and unemployment, differences in the treatment of specific groups or differences in the operational criteria used to determine the individual&#x2019;s labour force status<ins class="diffins">. </ins></p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Work statistics for countries not using the same set of statistical standards are not comparable. As such, each series is based on a single set of standards (i.e., 13</ins><sup><ins class="mod"><ins class="diffins">th</ins></sup><ins class="diffins">&nbsp;or 19</ins><sup><ins class="mod"><ins class="diffins">th</ins></sup><ins class="diffins">&nbsp;ICLS) and contains only data comparable within and across countries, allowing data users to continue making meaningful time series analysis and international comparisons. Users should not compare data across series</ins>.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate is dependent on the geographical coverage of the survey since urban and rural areas tend to have significant differences in the incidence of unemployment. It is important to note that unemployment indicators do not convey any information on the characteristics of the unemployed (their education level, ethnic origin, socio-economic background, work experience, duration of unemployment, etc.), which is crucial to cast light on labour market failures.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">7.
