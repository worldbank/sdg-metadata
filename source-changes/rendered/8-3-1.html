Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
<p>This indicator presents the share of employment which is classified as informal employment in the total economy, and separately in agriculture and in non-agriculture.</p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p>Employment comprises all persons of working age who, during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit.<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;The difference between the two series for a given country is the operational criteria used to define employment, with one series based on the statistical standards from the 13</ins><sup><ins class="mod"><ins class="diffins">th</ins></sup><ins class="diffins">&nbsp;International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) and the other series based on 19</ins><sup><ins class="mod"><ins class="diffins">th</ins></sup><ins class="diffins">&nbsp;ICLS standards. In the 19</ins><sup><ins class="mod"><ins class="diffins">th</ins></sup><ins class="diffins">&nbsp;ICLS series, employment is defined more narrowly as work done for pay or profit, while activities not done mainly in exchange for remuneration (i.e., own-use production work, volunteer work and unpaid trainee work) are recognized as other forms of work.</ins></p>
<p>Informal employment comprises persons who in their main or secondary jobs were in one of the following categories:</p>
<p>- Own-account workers, employers and members of producers&#x2019; cooperatives employed in their own informal sector enterprises (the characteristics of the enterprise determine the informal nature of their jobs)<del class="diffdel">;</del></p>
<p>- Own-account workers engaged in the production of goods exclusively for own final use by their household (e.g. subsistence farming)<del class="diffdel">;</del></p>
<p>- Contributing family workers, regardless of whether they work in formal or informal sector enterprises (they usually do not have explicit, written contracts of employment, and are not subject to labour legislation, social security regulations, collective agreements, etc., which determines the informal nature of their jobs)<del class="diffdel">;</del></p>
<p>- Employees holding informal jobs, whether employed by formal sector enterprises, informal sector enterprises, or as paid domestic workers by households (employees are considered to have informal jobs if their employment relationship is, in law or in practice, not subject to national labour legislation, income taxation, social protection or entitlement to certain employment benefits)<del class="diffdel">.</del></p>
<p>For the purpose of classifying persons into formal or informal employment for this indicator, only the characteristics of the main job are considered. </p>
<p>An enterprise belongs to the informal sector if it fulfils the three following conditions:</p>
<p>- It is an unincorporated enterprise (it is not constituted as a legal entity separate from its owners, and it is owned and controlled by one or more members of one or more households, and it is not a quasi-corporation: it does not have a complete set of accounts, including balance sheets)<del class="diffdel">;</del></p>
<p>- It is a market enterprise (it sells at least some of the goods or services it produces);</p>
<p>- The enterprise is not registered or the employees of the enterprise are not registered or the number of persons engaged on a continuous basis is below a threshold determined by the country<del class="diffdel">.</del></p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">3.b.

Rationale (RATIONALE)</div></div></div><p>In contexts where social protection coverage is limited, social security benefits (such as unemployment insurance) are insufficient or even inexistent, and/or where wages and pensions are low, individuals may have to take up informal employment to ensure their livelihood. In these situations, indicators such as the unemployment rate would provide a very incomplete picture of the labour market situation, overlooking major deficits in the quality of employment. Statistics on informality are key to assessing the quality of employment in an economy and are relevant to developing and developed countries alike (ILOSTAT indicator description for informality, available at <a href="https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/description-informality/">https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/description-informality/</a>).</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.d.

Comparability/deviation from international standards (COMPARABILITY)</div></div></div><p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>
<p>Although some international standards do exist for the compilation of informal employment statistics, the relevant concepts and definitions have been left relatively flexible so as to accommodate national contexts and needs. This means that, in practice, the operational criteria used by countries to compile data at the national level vary significantly from country to country, hindering the international comparability of statistics. The comparability of informal employment statistics is also highly sensitive to differences in the geographical areas covered, the economic activities covered and the treatment of special groups of workers.</p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><ins class="diffins">Work statistics for countries not using the same set of statistical standards are not comparable. As such, each series is based on a single set of standards (i.e., 13</ins><sup><ins class="mod"><ins class="diffins">th</ins></sup><ins class="diffins">&nbsp;or 19</ins><sup><ins class="mod"><ins class="diffins">th</ins></sup><ins class="diffins">&nbsp;ICLS) and contains only data comparable within and across countries, allowing data users to continue making meaningful time series analysis and international comparisons. Users should not compare data across series. </ins></p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">7.
