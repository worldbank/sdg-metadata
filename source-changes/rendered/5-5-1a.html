<p>The proportion of seats held by women in <del class="diffdel">(a) </del>national parliaments, currently as <del class="diffmod">at</del><ins class="diffmod">of</ins> 1 January of reporting year, is currently measured as the number of seats held by women members in single or lower chambers of national parliaments, expressed as a percentage of all occupied seats.</p>
<p>National parliaments can be bicameral or unicameral. This indicator covers the single chamber in unicameral parliaments and the lower chamber in bicameral parliaments. It does not cover the upper chamber of bicameral parliaments. Seats are usually won by members in general parliamentary elections. Seats may also be filled by nomination, appointment, indirect election, rotation of members<ins class="diffins">,</ins> and by-election.</p>
<p>Seats refer to the number of parliamentary mandates<del class="diffdel">,</del> or the number of members of parliament.</p>

Institutional mandate (INST_MANDATE)</div></div></div><p>The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) is the global organization of parliaments. It was founded in 1889 as the first multilateral political organization in the world, encouraging cooperation and dialogue between all nations. Today, the <ins class="diffins">Inter-Parliamentary Union (</ins>IPU<ins class="diffins">)</ins> comprises 179 national Member Parliaments and 13 regional parliamentary bodies. It promotes democracy and helps parliaments become stronger, younger, gender-balanced<ins class="diffins">,</ins> and more diverse. </p>
<p>The IPU recognizes gender equality as a key component of democracy. It works to achieve equal participation of men and women in politics and supports parliaments in advancing gender equality. This includes the collection and dissemination of quantitative and qualitative data on women in politics. In particular, the IPU has tracked the percentage of women in national parliaments since 1945 and is the authority for this data. See historical and comparative data on women in parliament at <a href="https://data.ipu.org/historical-women">https://data.ipu.org/historical-women</a>. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.a. Rationale (RATIONALE)</div></div></div><p>The indicator measures the degree to which women have equal access to parliamentary decision<del class="diffmod">&nbsp;</del><ins class="diffmod">-</ins>making. Women&#x2019;s participation in parliaments is a key aspect of women&#x2019;s opportunities in political and public life<del class="diffdel">,</del> and is<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;therefore</del> linked to women&#x2019;s empowerment. Equal numbers of women and men in lower chambers would give an indicator value of 50 <del class="diffmod">per cent</del><ins class="diffmod">percent</ins>.</p>
<p>A stronger presence of women in parliament allows new concerns to be highlighted on political agendas, and new priorities to be put into practice through the adoption and implementation of policies and laws. The inclusion of the perspectives and interests of women is a prerequisite for democracy and gender equality<del class="diffdel">,</del> and contributes to good governance. A representative parliament also allows the different experiences of men and women to affect the social, political<ins class="diffins">,</ins> and economic future of societies.</p>
<p>Changes in the indicator have been tracked over time. Although the international community has supported and promoted women&#x2019;s participation in political decision-making structures for several decades, improvement in women&#x2019;s access to parliament has been slow. This has led to the introduction of special <del class="diffmod">policy</del><ins class="diffmod">policies</ins> and legal measures to increase women&#x2019;s shares of parliamentary seats in several countries. Those countries that have adopted special measures generally have greater representation of women in parliament than countries without special measures.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.b. Comment and limitations (REC_USE_LIM)</div></div></div><p>- The number of countries covered varies with suspensions or dissolutions of parliaments. As of 1 February 2016, 193 countries are included.</p>
<p>- There can be difficulties in obtaining information on by-election results and replacements due to death or resignation. These changes are ad hoc events <del class="diffmod">which</del><ins class="diffmod">that</ins> are more difficult to keep track of. By-elections, for instance, are often not announced internationally as general elections are.</p>
<p>- The data excludes the numbers and percentages of women in <ins class="diffins">the </ins>upper chambers of parliament. The information <del class="diffmod">in</del><ins class="diffmod">is</ins> available on the <ins class="diffins">Inter-Parliamentary Union (</ins>IPU<ins class="diffins">)</ins> website at <a href="https://data.ipu.org/women-ranking">https://data.ipu.org/women-ranking</a>.</p>
<p>- Parliaments vary considerably in their internal workings and procedures, however, generally legislate, oversee government and represent the electorate. In terms of measuring women&#x2019;s contribution to political decision<del class="diffmod">&nbsp;</del><ins class="diffmod">-</ins>making, this indicator may not be sufficient because some women may face obstacles in fully and efficiently carrying out their parliamentary mandate.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.c.
