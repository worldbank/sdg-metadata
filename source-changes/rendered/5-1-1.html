<p>Indicator 5.1.1 measures Government efforts to put in place legal frameworks that promote, enforce and monitor gender equality. </p>
<p>The indicator is based on an assessment of legal frameworks that promote, enforce and monitor gender equality. The assessment is carried out by national counterparts, including National Statistical Offices (NSOs) and/or National Women&#x2019;s Machinery (NWMs), and legal practitioners/researchers on gender equality, using a questionnaire comprising 42 yes/no questions under four areas of law: (i) overarching legal frameworks and public life; (ii) violence against women; (iii) employment and economic benefits; and (iv) marriage and family<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[1]</a></sup>. The areas of law and questions are drawn from the international legal and policy framework on gender equality, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which has 189 States parties, and the Beijing Platform for Action. As such, no new internationally agreed standard on equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex was needed. The primary sources of information relevant for indicator 5.1.1 are legislation and policy/action plans.</p>
<p>The 42 questions in the questionnaire are:</p>

<h2>Concepts: </h2>
<p>Article 1 of CEDAW provides a comprehensive definition of discrimination against women covering direct and indirect discrimination and article 2 sets out general obligations for States, in particular on required legal frameworks, to eliminate discrimination against women. Article 1 of CEDAW states: &#x201C;&#x2026; the term &quot;discrimination against women&quot; shall mean any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field&#x201D;.<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;Article 2 of CEDAW states: States Parties condemn discrimination against women in all its forms, agree to pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating discrimination against women and, to this end, undertake: (a) To embody the principle of the equality of men and women in their national constitutions or other appropriate legislation if not yet incorporated therein and to ensure, through law and other appropriate means, the practical realization of this principle; (b) To adopt appropriate legislative and other measures, including sanctions where appropriate, prohibiting all discrimination against women; (c) To establish legal protection of the rights of women on an equal basis with men and to ensure through competent national tribunals and other public institutions the effective protection of women against any act of discrimination; (d) To refrain from engaging in any act or practice of discrimination against women and to ensure that public authorities and institutions shall act in conformity with this obligation; (e) To take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women by any person, organization or enterprise; (f) To take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to modify or abolish existing laws, regulations, customs and practices which constitute discrimination against women; (g) To repeal all national penal provisions which constitute discrimination against women&#x201D;. </ins></p>
<p>The term &#x201C;legal frameworks&#x201D; is defined broadly to encompass laws, mechanisms<ins class="diffins">,</ins> and policies/plans to &#x2018;promote, enforce and monitor&#x2019; gender equality. </p>
<p>Legal frameworks that &#x201C;promote&#x201D; are those that establish women&#x2019;s equal rights with men and enshrine non-discrimination <ins class="diffins">based </ins>on<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;the basis of</del> sex.

Since 2009, the World Bank Group&#x2019;s Women, Business and the Law project has contributed to the study of gender equality and informed discussions on improving women&apos;s economic opportunities and empowerment through a unique dataset that measures the legal differences <del class="diffmod">on</del><ins class="diffmod">in</ins> access to economic opportunities between men and women in 190 economies. </p>
<p>The OECD Development Centre&#x2019;s core mission is to provide a platform for evidence-based policy dialogue between OECD and non-OECD countries to design better policies, by identifying policy solutions to improve lives in developing countries. Through its Gender Programme, particularly since the creation of the Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) in 2009, the OECD Development Centre has played an instrumental role in highlighting the data gaps and fostering policy dialogue and mutual learning on the social institutions that discriminate against women and girls across their life cycle. It is also building the capacity of member states in data collection through the SIGI Country Studies, and advocates for more, better, and comparable data through its SIGI Global and Regional Reports and policy dialogue events.</p>
<p>UN Women is committed through its work at the global, regional<ins class="diffins">,</ins> and county level to support Member States in filling critical gaps in generating and using data, statistics, evidence<ins class="diffins">,</ins> and analysis on gender equality in crucial areas.

This framework sets out the commitments of States to eliminate discrimination against women and promote gender equality, including in the area of legal frameworks. </p>
<p>In the Beijing Platform for Action, States pledged to revoke any remaining laws that discriminate <ins class="diffins">based </ins>on<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;the basis of</del> sex. The five-year review and appraisal of the Beijing Platform for Action (Beijing +<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del>5) established 2005 as the target date for the repeal of laws that discriminate against women. This deadline has come and gone. While there has been progress in reforming laws to promote gender equality, discrimination against women in the law continues in many countries. Even where legal reforms have taken place, gaps in implementation persist.</p>
<p>Removing discriminatory laws and putting in place legal frameworks that advance gender equality are prerequisites to ending discrimination against women and achieving gender equality (Goal 5, Target 5.1).

  </math>. The score for each area (a number between 0 and 100) therefore represents the percentage of achievement of that country in that area, with 100 being best practice met on all questions in the area. </p>
<p>The choice of presenting all four area scores without further aggregation is the result of adopting the posture that high values in one area in a given country need not compensate in any way the country having low values in some other area, and that a comprehensive examination of the value of those four numbers for each country is potentially more informative than trying to summarize all four numbers into a single index.</p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup class="footnote-number" id="footnote-4">3</sup><p> For questions 1 and 2, the methodology does not attribute a score (positive or negative) to the existence of customary or personal law<del class="diffdel">,</del> but does score whether they are subject to constitutional principles of equality or <del class="diffmod">nondiscrimination</del><ins class="diffmod">non-discrimination</ins>.
