<p>Proportion of girls and women aged 15-49 years who have undergone female genital mutilation.</p>
<p>This indicator can be measured among smaller age groups, with the experience of younger women representing FGM/C that has occurred more recently and the experience of older women representing levels of the practice in the past. At the regional and global level, this indicator is currently being reported as the proportion of adolescent girls aged 15-19 years who have undergone female genital mutilation.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Concepts:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Female genital mutilation (FGM) refers to &#x201C;all procedures involving partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons&quot; (World Health Organization, Eliminating Female Genital Mutilation: An interagency statement, WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNIFEM, OHCHR, UNHCR, UNECA, UNESCO, UNDP, UNAIDS, WHO, Geneva, 2008, p.4)</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.f.
