Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Definition:</ins></strong></p>
<p>This indicator refers to the proportion of females in the total number of persons employed in managerial positions. It is recommended to use two different measures jointly for this indicator: the share of females in (total) management and the share of females in senior and middle management (thus excluding junior management). The joint calculation of these two measures provides information on whether women are more represented in junior management than in senior and middle management, thus pointing to an eventual ceiling for women to access higher-level management positions. In these cases, calculating only the share of women in (total) management would be misleading, in that it would suggest that women hold positions with more decision-making power and responsibilities than they actually do.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Concepts:</ins></strong></p>
<p>- Employment comprises all persons of working age who, during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit.</p>
<p>- Employment in management is determined according to the categories of the latest version of the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-08), which organizes jobs into a clearly defined set of groups based on the tasks and duties undertaken in the job. For the purpose of this indicator, it is preferable to refer separately to senior and middle management only, and to total management (including junior management). The share of women tends to be higher in junior management than in senior and middle management, so limiting the indicator to a measure including junior management may introduce bias. Senior and middle management correspond to sub-major groups 11, 12 and 13 in ISCO-08 and sub-major groups 11 and 12 in ISCO-88. If statistics are not available disaggregated at the sub-major group level (two-digit level of ISCO), then major group 1 of ISCO-88 and ISCO-08 can be used as a proxy and the indicator would then refer only to total management (including junior management).</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.f. Treatment of missing values (i) at country level and (ii) at regional level (IMPUTATION)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">&#x2022; At country level</ins></strong></p>
<p>Multivariate regression and cross-validation techniques are used to impute missing values at the country level. The additional variables used for the imputation include a range of indicators, including labour market and economic data. However, the imputed missing country values are only used to calculate the global and regional estimates; they are not used for international reporting on the SDG indicators by the ILO. </p>
<p>For a more detailed methodological description, please refer to the ILO modelled estimates methodological overview, available at https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/TEM.pdf.</p>

Data availability and disaggregation (COVERAGE)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Data availability: </ins></strong></p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p>Data on proportion of women in managerial positions is available for 168 countries and territories. Data on women in senior and middle management positions is available for 116 countries and territories.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Time series:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Data for this indicator is available as of 2000 in the SDG Indicators Global Database, but time series going back several decades are available in ILOSTAT.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Disaggregation:</ins></strong></p>
<p>This indicator requires no disaggregation per se, although employment statistics by both sex and occupation are needed to calculate it. If statistics are available and the sample size permits, it may be of interest to cross-tabulate this indicator by economic activity (ISIC) or disaggregate further to observe the share of women across more detailed occupational groups.</p></div>
