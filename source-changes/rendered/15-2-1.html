<p><strong>Annex 1 &#x2013; Terms and Definitions </strong></p>
<p><strong>FOREST</strong></p>
<p>Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with <u>tree</u>s higher than 5 meters and a <u>canopy cover</u> of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds <em>in situ</em>. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use. </p>
<p><u>Explanatory notes</u></p>
<ol>
  <li>Forest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of other predominant land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 meters. </li>
  <li>Includes areas with young trees that have not yet reached but which are expected to reach a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of 5 meters or more. It also includes areas that are temporarily unstocked due to clear-cutting as part of a forest management practice or natural disasters, and which are expected to be regenerated within 5 years. Local conditions may, in exceptional cases, justify that a longer time frame is used.</li>
  <li>Includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those of specific environmental, scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest.</li>
  <li>Includes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectares and width of more than 20 meters.</li>
  <li>Includes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of trees that have, or are expected to reach, a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of at least 5 meters.</li>
  <li>Includes areas with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless whether this area is classified as land area or not.</li>
  <li>Includes rubberwood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations. </li>
  <li>Includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height and canopy cover criteria are met.</li>
  <li><u>Excludes</u> tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive orchards and agroforestry systems when crops are grown under tree cover. <u>Note:</u> Some agroforestry systems such as the &#x201C;Taungya&#x201D; system where crops are grown only during the first years of the forest rotation should be classified as forest.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ABOVE-GROUND BIOMASS</strong></p>
<p>All living biomass above the soil including stem, stump, branches, bark, seeds, and foliage.</p>
<p><u>Explanatory note </u></p>
<ol>
  <li>In cases where forest understorey is a relatively small component of the aboveground biomass carbon pool, it is acceptable to exclude it, provided this is done in a consistent manner throughout the inventory time series.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>PROTECTED AREAS</strong></p>
<p>Areas especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources, and managed through legal or other effective means.</p>
<p><strong>FOREST AREA WITHIN PROTECTED AREAS</strong></p>
<p>Forest area within formally established protected areas independently of the purpose for which the protected areas were established. </p>
<p><u>Explanatory notes</u></p>
<ol>
  <li>Includes IUCN Categories I &#x2013; IV</li>
  <li><u>Excludes</u> IUCN Categories V-VI</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>FOREST AREA WITH MANAGEMENT PLAN</strong></p>
<p>Forest area that has a long-term documented management plan, aiming at defined management goals, which is periodically revised. </p>
<p><u>Explanatory notes</u></p>
<ol>
  <li>A forest area with management plan may refer to forest management unit level or aggregated forest management unit level (forest blocks, farms, enterprises, watersheds, municipalities, or wider units).</li>
  <li>A management plan must include adequate detail on operations planned for individual operational units (stands or compartments) but may also provide general strategies and activities planned to reach management goals.</li>
  <li>Includes forest area in protected areas with management plan.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED FOREST MANAGEMENT CERTIFICATION</strong></p>
<p>Forest area certified under a forest management certification scheme with published standards and is independently verified by a third-party.</p>
<p><strong>Annex 2 &#x2013; Methodology</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sub-indicator 1 - Annual forest area change rate</strong></p>
<p><u>Unit</u>: Percent</p>
<p><u>Reference period:</u> 2010-2020</p>
<p><u>Method of estimation:</u> Compound annual change rate formula as follows:</p>

<p>where: </p>
<p><em>r</em> = compound annual change rate for the period <em>t<sub>1 - </sub>t<sub>2</sub></em><sub> </sub></p>
<p><em>t<sub>i</sub></em> = time i (year)</p>
<p><em>AF<sub>t1</sub></em> = forest area at <em>t<sub>1</sub></em> </p>
<p><em>AF<sub>t2</sub></em> = forest area at <em>t<sub>2</sub></em></p>
<p><u>Translation to dashboard/traffic light:</u></p>
<p>The following flowchart explains the logic behind the translation of this indicator to a dashboard/traffic light:</p>
<p>Forest area change direction</p>
<p>Forest area stable </p>
<p>or increasing</p>
<p>Forest area decreasing</p>
<p>Change in forest area loss rate </p>
<p>Loss rate</p>
<p>decreasing</p>
<p>Loss rate stable</p>
<p>or increasing</p>
<p>The forest area change direction is determined by examining the value of the forest area change rate for the most recent period, a negative value indicate a loss of forest area, a zero value means that forest area is stable, and a positive value means that forest area has increased. The change in forest area loss rate<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[1]</a></sup> is based on a comparison of the annual forest area change rate for the period 2010-2020 with the annual <u>forest area change rate for the period 2000-2010 </u>(<u>baseline).</u></p>
<p><u>Comments:</u></p>
<p>This traffic light takes into consideration both the direction of forest area change (if forest area increases or decreases) as well as changes in the rate of forest area loss &#x2013; the latter important in order to indicate progress among countries that are losing forest area but manage to reduce the loss rate. </p>
<p>The baseline should be updated every 5 years. In 2020 a new baseline was calculated for the period 2000-2010 based on updated country data. </p>

<p>The indicator value for the latest reporting year is compared with the indicator value reported for 2010.</p>
<p>The ratio (r) between the current indicator value and the value reported for 2010 is calculated; r&gt;1 means an increase in stock per hectare, r&lt;1 means a decrease while 1 indicates no change.
