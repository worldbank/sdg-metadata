<p>This information refers only to 17.19.02b: Proportion of countries that have achieved 100 per cent birth registration and 80 per cent death registration</p>
<p>According to the Principles and Recommendations for a Vital Statistics System, Revision 3 (https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/standmeth/principles/M19Rev3en.pdf), a complete civil registration is defined as: &#x201C;The registration in the civil registration system of every vital event that has occurred to the members of the population of a particular country (or area), within a specified period as a result of which every such event has a vital registration record and the system has attained 100 per cent coverage.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In a given country or area, the level of completeness of birth registration can be different from the level of completeness of death registration. </p>
<p>There exist several methods for the evaluation of completeness of birth or death registration systems. </p>
<p>An elaboration of these methods is available at Principles and Recommendations for a Vital Statistics System, Revision 3. The evaluation and monitoring of quality and completeness of birth and death registration systems are addressed in Part three, sub-Chapters: D. Quality assessment methods; E. Direct versus indirect assessment, and F. Choosing appropriate methods for assessing completeness and qualitative accuracy of registration and register-based vital statistics (para 579 to 622).</p>
<p>Indicator 17.19.02b has two parts; the first concerning the birth registration and the second concerning the death registration of each individual country or area. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.f. Treatment of missing values (i) at country level and (ii) at regional level (IMPUTATION)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">&#x2022; At country level</ins></strong></p>
<p>No attempts are made to provide estimates of completeness of birth and death registration, when such information is not reported via the United Nations Demographic Yearbook data collection.</p>

<p>By their definition, the sub-indicators of the indicator 17.19.02b refer to the national levels of completeness of birth and death registration. </p>
<p>However, knowledge of the birth and death registration completeness at sub-national administrative areas, as well as by income, sex, age group, disability status, etc. is very important for monitoring and improving the functioning of birth and death registration systems.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">6.
