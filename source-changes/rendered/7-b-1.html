The dataset covers all countries and areas from the year 2000 onwards. The dataset also records whether the capacity is on-grid or off-grid and is split into 36 different renewable energy types that can be aggregated into the six main sources of renewable energy.</p>
<p><strong>Population data:</strong></p>
<p>For the population part of this indicator, IRENA uses population data from the United Nations World Population Prospects. The population data reflects the residents in a country or area regardless of legal status or citizenship. The values are midyear estimates.</p>
<p>The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs published information about <del class="diffmod">their</del><ins class="diffmod">its</ins> methodology on the link below:</p>

Data collection method (COLL_METHOD)</div></div></div><p>The capacity data <del class="diffmod">is</del><ins class="diffmod">are</ins> collected as part of IRENA&#x2019;s annual questionnaire cycle. Questionnaires are sent to countries at the start of a year asking for renewable energy data for two years previously (i.e. at the start of 2019, questionnaires ask for data for the year 2017). The data <del class="diffmod">is</del><ins class="diffmod">are</ins> then validated and checked with countries and published in the IRENA Renewable Energy Statistics Yearbook at the end of June. To minimise reporting burden, the questionnaires for some countries are pre-filled with data collected by other agencies (e.g. Eurostat) and are sent to countries for them to complete any additional details requested by IRENA.</p>
<p>At the same time as this, preliminary estimates of capacity for the previous year are also collected from official sources where available (e.g. national statistics, data from electricity grid operators) and from other unofficial sources (mostly industry associations for the different renewable energy sectors). These are published at the end of March.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">3.c.

Rationale (RATIONALE)</div></div></div><p>The infrastructure and technologies required to supply modern and sustainable energy services cover a wide range of equipment and devices that are used across numerous economic sectors. There is no readily available mechanism to collect, aggregate and measure the contribution of this disparate group of products to the delivery of modern and sustainable energy services. However, one major part of the energy supply chain that can be readily measured is the infrastructure used to produce electricity. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Renewables are considered a sustainable form of energy supply, as their current use does not usually deplete their availability to be used in the future. The focus of this indicator on electricity reflects the emphasis <del class="diffmod">in</del><ins class="diffmod">of</ins> the target on modern sources of energy and is particularly relevant for developing countries where the demand for electricity is often high and its availability is constrained. Furthermore, the focus on renewables reflects the fact that the technologies used to produce renewable electricity are generally modern and more sustainable than non-renewables, particularly in the fastest growing sub-sectors of electricity generation from wind and solar energy.<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;</ins></p>
<p>The division of renewable electricity capacity by population (to produce a measure of Watts per capita) is <del class="diffmod">proposed</del><ins class="diffmod">proposing</ins> to scale the capacity data to account for the large variation in needs between countries. It uses population rather than GDP to scale the data, because this is the most basic indicator of the demand for modern and sustainable energy services in a country.</p>
<p>This indicator should also complement indicators 7.1.1 and 7.2.<ins class="diffins">1.</ins> With respect to electricity access, it will provide additional information to the proportion of people with electricity access by showing how much infrastructure is available to deliver that access (in terms of the amount of capacity per person). The focus on renewable capacity will also add<del class="diffmod">-</del><ins class="diffmod">&nbsp;</ins>value to the existing renewables indicator (7.2<ins class="diffins">.1</ins>) by showing how much renewable energy is contributing to the need for improved electricity access.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.e.

Treatment of missing values (i) at country level and (ii) at regional level (IMPUTATION)</div></div></div><p><strong>At country level:</strong></p>
<p>At the country level, electricity capacity data <del class="diffmod">is</del><ins class="diffmod">are</ins> sometimes missing for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Delays in responding to IRENA questionnaires or publication of official data. In such cases, estimates are made so that global and regional totals can be calculated. The most basic treatment is to repeat the value of capacity from the previous year. However, IRENA also checks unofficial data sources and collects data about investment projects (see Indicator 7.a.1). These other sources can be used to identify if any new power plants have been commissioned in a year and are used where available to update the capacity value at the end of a year. Any such estimates are eventually replaced by official or questionnaire data when that becomes available.</li>
  <li>Off-grid capacity data <del class="diffmod">is</del><ins class="diffmod">are</ins> frequently missing from national energy statistics<del class="diffdel">,</del> or is presented in non-standard units (e.g. numbers of mini-hydro plants in a country rather than their capacity in MW). Where official data <del class="diffmod">is</del><ins class="diffmod">are</ins> not available, off-grid capacity figures are collected by IRENA from a wide variety of other official and unofficial sources in countries (e.g. development agencies, government departments, NGOs, project developers and industry associations) and this information is added to the capacity database to give a more complete picture of developments in the renewable energy sector in a country. <del class="diffmod">This</del><ins class="diffmod">These</ins> data <del class="diffmod">is</del><ins class="diffmod">are</ins> peer reviewed each year through an extensive network of national correspondents (the REN21 Network) and is checked with IRENA country focal points when they attend IRENA meetings and training workshops.</li>
</ol>
<p>When capacity data <del class="diffmod">is</del><ins class="diffmod">are</ins> missing, mostly in non-state territories, these are excluded from the dataset. </p>
<p><strong>At regional and global levels:</strong></p>
<p>See above. Regional and global totals are only estimated to the extent that figures for some countries may be estimated in each year. (See also data availability below). </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.g. Regional aggregations (REG_AGG)</div></div></div><p>Regional and global averages are calculated by summing the renewable generating capacity for a region or the World and dividing that by the corresponding figure for<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;the</ins> total population. The indicator is for developing countries only, so these regional aggregates (averages) also reflect only the average for the developing countries in each region.</p>
<p>This calculation excludes the population of those countries and/or territories that have missing capacity data. As such, the regional and global population values used in the calculation might differ from those reported in the UN World Population Prospects.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.h.

Data availability and disaggregation (COVERAGE)</div></div></div><p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>
<p>The total number of capacity records in the database (all developing countries/areas, all years since 2000, all technologies) is 11,000. In terms of numbers of records, 3,120 (28%) are estimates and 740 (7%) are from unofficial sources. The remaining records (65%) are all from returned questionnaires or official data sources. </p>
<p>However, in terms of the amount of capacity covered in the database, the shares of data from estimated and unofficial sources is only 5% and 1% respectively. The large difference between these measures is due to the inclusion of off-grid capacity figures in the database. The amount of off-grid generating capacity in a country is <del class="diffdel">quite </del>frequently estimated by IRENA, but the amounts of off-grid capacity recorded in each case is often relatively small.</p>
<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>
<p>Renewable generating capacity data <del class="diffmod">is</del><ins class="diffmod">are</ins> available from 2000 onwards. </p>
<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>
<p>IRENA&#x2019;s renewable capacity data <del class="diffmod">is</del><ins class="diffmod">are</ins> available for every country and area in the world from the year 2000 onwards. These figures can also be disaggregated by technology (solar, hydro, wind, etc.) and by on-grid and off-grid capacity.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">7.
