<p>As part of global efforts to accelerate expansion of preventive chemotherapy for elimination and control of lymphatic filariasis (LF), schistosomiasis (SCH) and soil-transmitted helminthiases (STH), WHO facilitates the supply of the following medicines donated by the pharmaceutical industry: diethylcarbamazine citrate, albendazole, mebendazole, and praziquantel. WHO also collaborates to supply ivermectin for onchocerciasis (ONCHO) and <del class="diffmod">lymphatic filariasis</del><ins class="diffmod">LF</ins> elimination programmes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A joint mechanism and a set of forms have been developed to facilitate the process of application, review and reporting as well as to improve coordination and integration among different programmes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Joint Request for Selected PC Medicines (JRSM) &#x2013; designed to assist countries in quantifying the number of tablets of the relevant medicines required to reach the planned target population and districts in a coordinated and integrated manner against multiple diseases during the year for which medicines are requested. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Joint Reporting Form (JRF) &#x2013; designed to assist countries in reporting annual progress on integrated and coordinated distribution of medicines across PC-NTDs in the reporting year in a standardized format. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>PC Epidemiological Data Reporting Form (EPIRF) &#x2013; designed to standardize national reporting of epidemiological data on <del class="diffmod">lymphatic filariasis</del><ins class="diffmod">LF</ins>, <del class="diffmod">onchocerciasis</del><ins class="diffmod">ONCHO</ins>, soil-transmitted helminthiases and <del class="diffmod">schistosomiasis</del><ins class="diffmod">SCH</ins>. National authorities are encouraged to complete this form and submit it to WHO on a yearly basis, together with the JRF. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The reports generated in the JRSM and in the JRF (SUMMARY worksheets) must be printed and signed by the NTD coordinator or a Ministry of Health representative to formally endorse the country&#x2019;s request for these medicines and the reported annual progress of the national programme(s). The date of signature must also be included. Once signatures have been obtained, the scanned copies of the two worksheets, together with the full Excel versions of the JRSM, the JRF and the EPIRF can be jointly submitted to WHO. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The forms are submitted to the WHO Representative of the concerned WHO Country office with electronic copies to <em><u>PC_JointForms@who.int</u></em> and the concerned Regional focal point, no later than 15 August of the year preceding the year for which medicines are intended to be used (e.g. at the latest by 15 August 2015 for implementation of preventive chemotherapy in 2016) but at least 6-8 months before the planned PC intervention(s) to allow time for reviewing and approval of the request, placing order, manufacturing PC medicines and shipment to the country. </p>

Rationale (RATIONALE)</div></div></div><p><del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p><del class="diffdel">
</del><p>The average annual number of people requiring treatment and care for NTDs is the number that is expected to decrease toward &#x201C;the end of NTDs&#x201D; by 2030 (target 3.3), as NTDs are eradicated, eliminated or controlled. The number of people requiring other interventions against NTDs (e.g. vector management, veterinary public health, water, sanitation and hygiene) are expected<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;to need</del> to be maintained beyond 2030 and are therefore to be addressed in the context of other targets and indicators, namely Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and universal access to water and sanitation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This number should not be interpreted as the number of people at risk for NTDs. It is in fact a subset of the larger number of people at risk. Mass treatment is limited to those living in districts above a threshold level of prevalence; it does not include all people living in districts with any risk of infection. Individual treatment and care is for those who are or have already been infected; it does not include all contacts and others at risk of infection. This number can better be interpreted as the number of people at a level of risk requiring medical intervention &#x2013; that is, treatment and care for NTDs. </p>

  <li><strong>At country level </strong></li>
</ul><del class="diffdel">
</del><p><del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p>
<p>We do not impute missing values for countries that have never reported data for any NTD. For countries that have reported data in the past, we impute missing values only for those NTDs that have been reported in the past but that have not been reported in the current year. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For reproducibility, we employ multiple imputation techniques using the freely available Amelia package in R. We impute 100 complete datasets using all available cross-sectional data (countries and years), applying a square root transformation to exclude negative values of incidence, as well as categorical variables denoting regions and income groups, and allowing for country-specific linear time effects. We aggregate across diseases and extract the mean and 2.5th and 97.5th centile values to report best estimates and uncertainty intervals for each country. </p>

Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level (DOC_METHOD)</div></div></div><p>This indicator is based on national-level data reported to WHO by its Member States and disseminated via the WHO Global Health Observatory (<u><del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del>https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/neglected-tropical-diseases</u>) and <ins class="mod">PC</ins> Data Portal (http://apps.who.int/gho/cabinet/pc.jsp). Some adjustment is required to aggregate country-reported data on individual neglected tropical diseases across all NTDs included in this indicator. There is an established methodology to standardize this aggregation: <a href="http://www.who.int/wer/2012/wer8702.pdf?ua=1"><u>http://www.who.int/wer/2012/wer8702.pdf</u></a></p>
<p>Following a recommendation by the Working Group on Monitoring and Evaluation of the Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for NTDs, WHO has led the development of an integrated NTD database to improve evidence-based planning and management of NTD programmes at the national and sub-national levels. The Integrated NTD database is available here: <u> https://www.who.int/teams/control-of-neglected-tropical-diseases/preventive-chemotherapy/integrated-ntd-database</u>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For NTDs requiring preventive chemotherapy, a joint reporting mechanism and set of reporting forms have been developed to facilitate the process of requesting donated medicines and reporting progress as well as to improve coordination and integration among programmes<del class="diffmod">,</del><ins class="diffmod">.</ins> <del class="diffmod">more</del><ins class="diffmod">More</ins> information is available here,<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del><u> https://www.who.int/teams/control-of-neglected-tropical-diseases/preventive-chemotherapy/joint-application-package </u> </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>For the other NTDs, the number of new cases should be reported by the health facilities to the national level in order to compile them. If active case search activities are organized (e.g. for integrated skin NTDs, human African trypanosomiasis, etc.), the country must ensure that the number of new cases detected through these activities are also reported, either through the health facilities or directly to the national level. A strong health information system is essential for countries to be able to collect, compile and analyse good quality information on these NTDs.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">5.
