<p>As part of global efforts to accelerate expansion of preventive chemotherapy for elimination and control of lymphatic filariasis (LF), schistosomiasis (SCH) and soil-transmitted helminthiases (STH), WHO facilitates the supply of the following medicines donated by the pharmaceutical industry: diethylcarbamazine citrate, albendazole, mebendazole, and praziquantel. WHO also collaborates to supply ivermectin for onchocerciasis (ONCHO) and LF elimination programmes<ins class="diffins">, and azithromycin for trachoma (TRA) through the Trachoma Elimination Monitoring Form</ins>.<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p><del class="diffdel">

</del><p><del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p>
<p>Joint Request for Selected PC Medicines (JRSM) &#x2013; designed to assist countries in quantifying the number of tablets of the relevant medicines required to reach the planned target population and districts in a coordinated and integrated manner against multiple diseases during the year for which medicines are requested.<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p><del class="diffdel">
</del><p><del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p>

</del><p><del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p>
<p>PC Epidemiological Data Reporting Form (EPIRF) &#x2013; designed to standardize national reporting of epidemiological data on LF, ONCHO, soil-transmitted helminthiases and SCH.

Rationale (RATIONALE)</div></div></div><p>The average annual number of people requiring treatment and care for NTDs is the number that is expected to decrease toward &#x201C;the end of NTDs&#x201D; by 2030 (target 3.3), as NTDs are eradicated, eliminated or controlled. The number of people requiring other interventions against NTDs (e.g. vector management, veterinary public health, water, sanitation and hygiene) are expected to be maintained beyond 2030 and are therefore to be addressed in the context of other targets and indicators, namely Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and universal access to water and sanitation.<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p><del class="diffdel">
</del><p><del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p>
<p>This number should not be interpreted as the number of people at risk for NTDs. It is in fact a subset of the larger number of people at risk. Mass treatment is limited to those living in districts above a threshold level of prevalence; it does not include all people living in districts with any risk of infection. Individual treatment and care is for those who are or have already been infected; it does not include all contacts and others at risk of infection. This number can better be interpreted as the number of people at a level of risk requiring medical intervention &#x2013; that is, treatment and care for NTDs.<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p><del class="diffdel">
</del><p><del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.b. Comment and limitations (REC_USE_LIM)</div></div></div><p>Country reports may not be perfectly comparable over time. Improved surveillance and case-finding may lead to an apparent increase in the number of people known to require treatment and care. Some further estimation may be required to adjust for changes in surveillance and case-finding. Missing country reports may need to be imputed for some diseases in some years.<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.c. Method of computation (DATA_COMP)</div></div></div><p>Some estimation is required to aggregate data across interventions and diseases. There is an established methodology that has been tested and an agreed international standard. [<del class="diffmod">http</del><ins class="diffmod">https</ins>://<del class="diffmod">www</del><ins class="diffmod">apps</ins>.who.int/<del class="diffmod">wer</del><ins class="diffmod">iris</ins>/<del class="diffmod">2012</del><ins class="diffmod">bitstream</ins>/<del class="diffmod">wer8702</del><ins class="diffmod">handle/10665/241869/WER8702</ins>.<del class="diffmod">pdf?ua=1</del><ins class="diffmod">PDF</ins>]<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p><del class="diffdel">
</del><p><del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p>
<p>1) Average annual number of people requiring mass treatment known as PC for at least one PC-NTD (lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiases and trachoma). People may require PC for more than one PC-NTD. The number of people requiring PC is compared across the PC-NTDs, by age group and implementation unit (e.g. district). The largest number of people requiring PC is retained for each age group in each implementation unit. The total is considered to be a conservative estimate of the number of people requiring PC for at least one PC-NTD. Prevalence surveys determine when an NTD has been eliminated or controlled and PC can be stopped or reduced in frequency, such that the average annual number of people requiring PC is reduced.<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p><del class="diffdel">
</del><p><del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p>
<p>2) Number of new cases requiring individual treatment and care for other NTDs: The number of new cases is based on country reports, whenever available, of new and known cases of Buruli ulcer, dengue, dracunculiasis, echinococcosis, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), leprosy, the leishmaniases, rabies and yaws. Where the number of people requiring and requesting surgery for PC-NTDs (e.g. trichiasis or hydrocele surgery) is reported, it can be added here. Similarly, new cases requiring and requesting rehabilitation (e.g. leprosy or lymphoedema) can be added whenever available.<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p><del class="diffdel">
</del><p><del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p>
<p>Populations referred to under 1) and 2) may overlap; the sum would overestimate the total number of people requiring treatment and care. The maximum of 1) or 2) is therefore retained at the lowest common implementation unit and summed to get conservative country, regional and global aggregates. By 2030, improved co-endemicity data and models will validate the trends obtained using this simplified approach.<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.f.

<p>For NTDs requiring preventive chemotherapy, a joint reporting mechanism and set of reporting forms have been developed to facilitate the process of requesting donated medicines and reporting progress as well as to improve coordination and integration among programmes.

<p>For the other NTDs, the number of new cases should be reported by the health facilities to the national level in order to compile them. If active case search activities are organized (e.g. for integrated skin NTDs, human African trypanosomiasis, etc.), the country must ensure that the number of new cases detected through these activities are also reported, either through the health facilities or directly to the national level.

<p>Disaggregation by age is required for PC: preschool-aged children (1-4 years), school-aged (5-14 years) and adults (= 15 years+).<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">6. Comparability/deviation from international standards (COMPARABILITY)</div></div></div><p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>
<p>Countries do not typically aggregate their data across NTDs, but if they applied the aggregation method as described above, they would obtain the same number. The only exceptions would be countries with one or more missing values for individual NTDs. In these exceptional cases, internationally estimated aggregates will be higher than country produced aggregates that assume missing values are nil. We present best estimates with uncertainty intervals to highlight those missing values that have a significant impact on country aggregates, until such time that missing values are reported.<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">7.
