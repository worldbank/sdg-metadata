  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>UNICEF undertakes a wide consultative process of compiling and assessing data from national sources for the purposes of updating its global databases on the situation of children. Up until 2017, the mechanism <del class="diffmod">UNICEF</del><ins class="diffmod">it</ins> used to collaborate with national authorities on ensuring data quality and international comparability on key indicators of relevance to children was known as Country Data Reporting on the Indicators for the Goals (CRING).</li>
      <li>As of 2018, UNICEF launched a new country consultation process with national authorities on selected child-related global SDG indicators it is custodian or co-custodian <ins class="diffins">for, </ins>to meet emerging standards and guidelines on data flows for global reporting of SDG indicators, which place strong emphasis on technical rigour, country ownership and use of official data and statistics. The consultation process solicited feedback directly from National Statistical Offices<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;(NSOs)</ins>, as well as other government agencies responsible for official statistics, on the compilation of the indicators, including the data sources used, and the application of internationally agreed definitions, classification and methodologies to the data from that source. Once reviewed, feedback is made available to countries on whether or not specific data points are accepted, and if not, the reasons why. </li>

Rationale (RATIONALE)</div></div></div><p>Marriage before the age of 18 is a fundamental violation of human rights. Child marriage often compromises a girl&#x2019;s development by resulting in early pregnancy and social isolation, interrupting her schooling, limiting her opportunities for career and vocational advancement and placing her at increased risk of intimate partner violence. In many cultures, girls reaching puberty are expected to assume gender roles associated with womanhood. These include entering a union and becoming a mother. </p><del class="diffdel">
</del><p>The practice of early/child marriage is a direct manifestation of gender inequality. </p>
<p>The issue of child marriage is addressed in a number of international conventions and agreements. Although marriage is not mentioned directly in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, child marriage is linked to other rights &#x2013; such as the right to freedom of expression, the right to protection from all forms of abuse, and the right to be protected from harmful traditional practices.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.c.
