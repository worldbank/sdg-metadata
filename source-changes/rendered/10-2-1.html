Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><h2>Definition:</h2>
<p>The proportion of people living below 50 percent of median income (or consumption) is the share (%) of a country&#x2019;s population living on less than half of the consumption/income level of the median of the national income/consumption distribution. </p>
<h2>Concepts:</h2>
<p>The indicator is measured using per capita welfare measure of consumption or income. The indicator is calculated by estimating the share of the population in a country living on less than 50% of median of the national distribution of income or consumption, as estimated from survey data. </p>
<p>Per capita income or consumption is estimated using total household income or consumption divided by the total household size. Total disposable income or total consumption from both market and non-market sources is the desired welfare vector used. </p>
<p>The estimation relies on the same harmonized welfare vectors (distributions) that are used for 10.1.1 and 1.1.1. Using the same data and closely related methodologies ensures internal consistency across these closely related indicators. The data is available through <del class="diffmod">PovcalNet</del><ins class="diffmod">the Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP)</ins>, the World Bank&#x2019;s online tool for reporting global poverty and inequality numbers. For details on concepts and standards, refer to documentation available on the <del class="diffmod">PovcalNet</del><ins class="diffmod">PIP</ins> website. </p>
<p>The methodology entails measuring the share of people living below 50% of national median. A threshold set at 50% of the median of the income or consumption is used to derive a headcount rate, similar to how monetary poverty is typically measured. The national median is readily available from the distributional data in <del class="diffmod">PovcalNet</del><ins class="diffmod">PIP</ins>. The measurement follows a two-step process of first estimating half of the national median income (or consumption) and then the share of people living below this relative threshold.</p>
<p>The indicator uses the same data on household income and consumption that is used for monitoring SDG indicators 1.1.1 and 10.1.1, which have been classified as Tier 1 indicators. The methodology and data are similar to that used in measuring international poverty, which has been tested and vetted over many years, including for the purpose of monitoring MDG 1. It is also closely related to a large literature of relative poverty measurement. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">3.a. Data sources (SOURCE_TYPE)</div></div></div><p>Data of income or consumption comes from nationally representative household surveys or assessments of income or consumption distributions, typically carried out and overseen by National Statistical Offices (NSOs). After some quality control and harmonization the data is available through <del class="diffmod">PovcalNet</del><ins class="diffmod">PIP</ins>, the World Bank online tool for global poverty and inequality measurement.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">5. Data availability and disaggregation (COVERAGE)</div></div></div><p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>
<p>As of <del class="diffmod">2021</del><ins class="diffmod">2022</ins>, data is readily available on <del class="diffmod">168</del><ins class="diffmod">165</ins> countries, and the methodology is building on well-established practice used in international poverty measurement tested over many years. Estimates for the particular indicator have now been tested and validated and data are ready to be reported for all countries for which we report data for 1.1.1.</p>
<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>
<p>The database ranges from <del class="diffmod">1978</del><ins class="diffmod">1967</ins> to <del class="diffmod">2019</del><ins class="diffmod">2020</ins> and is updated up to twice a year.</p>
<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>
<p>The World Bank is working to improve the methodology and disaggregation of poverty and inequality measures by subgroups. Until methodological issues are resolved, disaggregation below the country level will not be addressed. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">7.
