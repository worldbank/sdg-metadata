<p>Seven FSIs are included as SDG indicators for 10.5.1 and expressed as percent.</p>

<p>2 - Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk-<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del>weighted assets </p>
<p>3 - Nonperforming loans net of provisions to capital </p>
<p>4 - Nonperforming loans to total gross loans </p>
<p>5 - Return on assets </p>
<p>6 - Liquid assets to short-term liabilities </p>
<p>7 - Net open position in foreign exchange to capital </p>
<p><ins class="mod"><em>Regulatory Tier 1 capital to assets</ins>:</em> This is the ratio of the core capital (Tier 1) to total (balance sheet) assets. <ins class="diffins">For jurisdictions that have implemented the Basel III leverage ratio, this indicator would be calculated using Tier 1 capital as the numerator and the exposure measure as the denominator, which comprises balance sheet assets, derivatives exposures, securities financing transaction exposures, and off-balance-sheet items.</ins></p>
<p> </p>
<p><ins class="mod"><em>Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk-<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del>weighted assets</ins>:</em> It is calculated using<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;total</del> regulatory Tier 1 capital as the numerator and risk-weighted assets as the denominator.

<p> </p>
<p><ins class="mod"><em>Nonperforming loans net of provisions to capital</ins>:</em> This FSI is calculated by taking the value of nonperforming loans (NPLs) less the value of specific <del class="diffmod">loan</del><ins class="diffmod">provisions</ins> <del class="diffmod">loss</del><ins class="diffmod">for</ins> <del class="diffmod">provisions</del><ins class="diffmod">NPLs</ins> as the numerator and<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;total regulatory</ins> capital as the denominator. <del class="diffdel">Capital is measured as total regulatory capital. </del></p>
<p> </p>
<p><ins class="mod"><em>Nonperforming loans to total gross loans</ins></em>: This FSI is calculated by using the value of NPLs as the numerator and the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and before the deduction of specific <del class="diffmod">loan-</del><ins class="diffmod">provisions</ins> <del class="diffmod">loss</del><ins class="diffmod">for</ins> <del class="diffmod">provisions</del><ins class="diffmod">NPLs</ins>) as the denominator. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><ins class="mod"><em>Return on assets</ins></em>: This FSI is calculated by dividing annualized net income before <del class="diffdel">extraordinary items and </del>taxes<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;(as recommended in the FSI Guide)</del> by the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) over the same period. </p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p><ins class="mod"><em>Net open position in foreign exchange to capital</ins></em>: The net open position in foreign exchange should be calculated based on the <del class="diffmod">recommendation</del><ins class="diffmod">guidance</ins> <del class="diffmod">of</del><ins class="diffmod">in</ins> the <del class="diffmod">Basel</del><em><ins class="mod"><ins class="diffmod">2019</ins> <del class="diffmod">Committee</del><ins class="diffmod">FSIs</ins> <del class="diffmod">for Banking Supervision (BCBS)</del><ins class="diffmod">Guide</ins></ins></em>. Capital should be total regulatory capital as net open position in foreign exchange is a supervisory concept. </p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p><ins class="mod"><em>Regulatory Tier 1 capital to assets</ins></em>: Regulatory Tier 1 capital is calculated based on Basel I, II, or III depending on countries&#x2019; supervisory practices. Denominator is total balance sheet (non-risk weighted) assets. <ins class="diffins">For jurisdictions that have implemented the Basel III leverage ratio, the denominator also includes off-balance-sheet items.</ins></p>
<p> </p>
<p><ins class="mod"><em>Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets</ins></em>: Regulatory Tier 1 capital is calculated based on Basel I, II, or III depending on countries&#x2019; supervisory practices. Denominator is risk-weighted assets also calculated based on Basel standards. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><ins class="mod"><em>Nonperforming loans (NPLs) net of provisions to capital</ins>:</em> A loan is classified as NPL when payment of principal or interest is past due by 90 days or more, or evidence exists that a full or partial amount of a loan is not going to be recovered. Only specific <del class="diffmod">loan</del><ins class="diffmod">provisions</ins> <del class="diffmod">loss</del><ins class="diffmod">for</ins> <del class="diffmod">provisions</del><ins class="diffmod">NPLs</ins> are used in this calculation and they refer <ins class="diffins">to </ins>charges against the value of specific <del class="diffmod">loans</del><ins class="diffmod">NPLs</ins>. Data exclude accrued interest <del class="diffmod">in</del><ins class="diffmod">on</ins> NPLs. Capital is measured as total regulatory capital calculated based on Basel I, II, or III depending on countries&#x2019; supervisory practices.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><ins class="mod"><em>Nonperforming loans to total gross loans</ins></em>: A loan is classified as NPL when payment of principal or interest is past due by 90 days or more, or evidence exists that a full or partial amount of a loan is not going to be recovered.

<p> </p>
<p><ins class="mod"><em>Return on assets</ins>:</em> The numerator is annualized net income before<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;extraordinary items and</del> taxes. The denominator is the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) over the same period. </p>

Rationale (RATIONALE)</div></div></div><p><strong>Regulatory Tier 1 capital to assets</strong>: It is a <del class="diffmod">more stringent version</del><ins class="diffmod">measure</ins> of <del class="diffdel">the </del>leverage <del class="diffmod">ratio and indicates</del><ins class="diffmod">indicating</ins> the extent to which assets are funded by other than own funds<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;and is a measure of capital adequacy of the deposit-taking sector</del>.<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk-<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del>weighted assets</strong>: It measures the capital adequacy of deposit takers based on the core capital concept of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). Capital adequacy and availability ultimately determine the degree of robustness of financial institutions to withstand shocks to their balance sheets. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Nonperforming loans net of provisions to capital</strong>: This FSI is a capital adequacy ratio and is an important indicator of the capacity of bank capital to withstand losses from NPLs that are not covered by specific <del class="diffmod">loan</del><ins class="diffmod">provisions</ins> <del class="diffmod">loss</del><ins class="diffmod">for</ins> <del class="diffmod">provisions</del><ins class="diffmod">NPLs</ins>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Nonperforming loans to total gross loans</strong>: This FSI is often used as a proxy for asset quality and is intended to identify problems with asset quality in the loan portfolio. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Return on assets</strong>: It is an indicator of bank profitability and is intended to measure deposit takers&#x2019; efficiency in using their assets. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Liquid assets to short-term liabilities</strong>: It is a <del class="diffmod">liquid asset</del><ins class="diffmod">liquidity</ins> ratio and is intended to capture the liquidity mismatch of assets and liabilities and provides an indication of the extent to which deposit takers can meet the short-term withdrawal of funds without facing liquidity problems. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Net open position in foreign exchange to capital</strong>: This FSI is an indicator of sensitivity to market risk, which is intended to gauge deposit takers&#x2019; exposure to exchange rate risk compared with capital. It measures the mismatch of foreign currency asset and liability positions to assess the vulnerability to exchange rate movements.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.b.
