Data availability and disaggregation (COVERAGE)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Data availability:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Global and regional aggregates on the component relating to the killing of journalists have already been reported upon on an annual basis and included in the UN SDG progress reports. Data on the killings of journalists is potentially covering all 195 Member States of UNESCO. Data on the status of judicial enquiries carried out on the killings was provided by 32 out of 62 concerned countries in 2016.</p>
<p>Data on violations against human rights defenders have been made available globally in reports and communications from international human rights mechanisms for many years. Data on the killings of journalists is available on an ongoing basis. Data on the status of judicial enquiries into the killings of journalists is available on an annual basis.</p>
<p>All these data, however, have not been collated for global SDG indicators reporting purposes. By 2018, the production of global and regional aggregates on killings for indicator 16.10.1 will be prioritized, with 2015 as baseline year.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Time series:</ins></strong></p>
<p>2014-2017 &#x2013; UNESCO Killing of Journalists</p>
<p>2015 &#x2013; 2017 &#x2013; SDG Indicator 16.10.1 on killings</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Disaggregation:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Using the minimum data requirements, the indicator seeks to provide the following disaggregation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sex and Age groups</li>
  <li>Type of violation or abuse</li>
  <li>Perpetrator status, e.g. State actor vs non-State actors</li>
  <li>Geographic location of the incident</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, desirable or additional data requirements may be used in order to show intersectionality and vulnerability within the main functional categories. Given sufficient dat a, for example, the indicator may provide disaggregated data on specific groups of human rights defenders according to the issues, peoples and communities they support which entail specific risks and socio-legal barriers.</p>
<p>With proper data disaggregation, the impact of gender-based violence such as femicide can be quantified using this indicator. Moreover, additional data categories can also be added to show intersectionality and vulnerability and provide empirical evidence on differentiated risks and difficult contexts experienced by specific categories of human rights defenders , journalists or</p>
<p>trade unionists. This is because gender significantly influences the way they may experience risks and threats. Gender-based discrimination may also be influenced by other factors, such as race, disability and other socially-constructed disadvantages. The intersection of these factors produces different vulnerabilities. It would therefore be useful to compile available data on protected grounds or the characteristics of an individual that should not be considered relevant to the differential treatment or enjoyment of a particular benefit. Disaggregation by the sexual orientation and gender identity of victims, and by any other prohibited grounds of discrimination, should be carried out in accordance with OHCHR guidance on a Human Rights-Based Approach to Data.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">6. Comparability/deviation from international standards (COMPARABILITY)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Sources of discrepancies:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Considering common challenges in the field of other crime statistics and administrative data sources, it is anticipated that the indicator will suffer from underreporting in some countries/contexts. Global data providers rely on reports from national sources with varying capacities to document incidents and to engage with international mechanisms. With the development of robust national data collection frameworks comprised of national human rights institutions, national statistical offices and civil society organizations supporting global data collection, supported by capacity building programmes and a periodic assessment of relevant networks, it is expected that discrepancies will be mitigated gradually.</p>
<p>While national data may still be compiled according to national legal systems rather than ICCS, OHCHR and its partner agencies will support UNODC as it undertakes special efforts to ensure the gradual implementation of ICCS by countries. Over time, this should help improve quality and consistency of national and international data.</p></div>
