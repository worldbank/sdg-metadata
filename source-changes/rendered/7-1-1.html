<p>Proportion of population with access to electricity is the percentage of population with access to electricity.</p>
<p>SDG7 ensures access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. Specifically, Indicator 7.1.1 refers to the proportion of population with access to electricity. This is expressed in percentage figures and is disaggregated by total, urban and rural access rates per country, as well as by UN regional and global classifications. </p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Concepts:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Electricity access in this scenario refers to the proportion of population in the considered area (country, region or global context) that has access to consistent sources of electricity. </p>
<p>The World Bank&#x2019;s Global Electrification Database compiles nationally representative household survey data as well as census data from 1990 to 2019. It also incorporates data from the Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa Poverty Database, and the Europe and Central Asia Poverty Database, all of which are based on similar surveys. At the time of this analysis, the Global Electrification Database contained 1,<del class="diffmod">228</del><ins class="diffmod">282</ins> surveys from <del class="diffmod">140</del><ins class="diffmod">139</ins> countries, excluding surveys from high-income countries as classified by the United Nations.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">2.c.

  <li>Regional and global classifications refer to the list of standard country or area codes for statistical use (M49) provided by the United Nations Statistics Division </li>

It also incorporates data from the Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa Poverty Database, and the Europe and Central Asia Poverty Database, all of which are based on similar surveys.

<p>To estimate values, a multilevel nonparametric modelling approach&#x2014;developed by the World Health Organization to estimate clean fuel usage&#x2014;was adapted to predict electricity access and used to fill in the missing data points for the time period between 1990 and 2019. Where data is available, access estimates are weighted by population. Multilevel nonparametric modelling considers the hierarchical structure of data (country and regional levels), using the regional classification of the United Nations. </p>
<p>The model is applied for all countries with at least one data point. In order to use as much real data as possible, results based on real survey data are reported in their original form for all years available. The statistical model is used to fill in data only for years where they are missing and to conduct global and regional analyses. In the absence of survey data for a given year, information from regional trends was borrowed. The difference between real data points and estimated values is clearly identified in the database. </p>
<p>Countries considered &#x201C;Developed&#x201D; by the United Nations and classified as &#x201C;High Income&#x201D; are assumed to have electrification rates of 100 percent from the first year the country joined the category. </p>
<p>In the present report, to avoid having electrification trends from 1990 to 2010 overshadow electrification efforts since 2010, the model was run twice: </p>
<ul>
  <li>With survey data + assumptions from 1990&#x2013;2019 for model estimates from 1990&#x2013;2019 </li>
  <li>With survey data + assumptions from 2010&#x2013;2019 for model estimates from 2010&#x2013;2019 </li>
</ul>
<p>Given the low frequency and the regional distribution of some surveys, several countries have gaps in available data. To develop the historical evolution and starting point of electrification rates, a simple modelling approach was adopted to fill in the missing data points. This modelling approach allowed the estimation of electrification rates for 220 countries over these time periods. The SE4ALL Global Tracking Framework Report (2013) referenced below provides more details on the suggested methodology for tracking access to energy (Chapter 2, Section 1, page 82-87).</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.f.

<p>Given the low frequency and regional distribution of some surveys, many countries have gaps in data availability. A simple modelling approach was adopted to fill in the missing data points, in order to develop the historical evolution and starting point of the electrification rates. The estimation is conducted using a model with region, country and time variables. The model keeps the original observation if data is available. The statistical model is used to fill in data only for years where they are missing and to help conduct global and regional analyses. In the absence of survey data for a given year, information from regional trends was borrowed. The estimated values are clearly identified (&#x201C;Estimate&#x201D;) in the database. In the meantime, if a country value indicates a high discrepancy compared with either IEA data or data from the past publication, the country is considered as an outlier and not affected by the regional trends. As a result, such countries only have their country effects in model estimates. </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><ins class="mod">At regional and global levels</ins></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Values for regional and global levels are calculated by incorporating all survey data along with model-estimated values substituting missing values. Regional and global classifications are based on the UN M49 series for statistical use.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">5. Data availability and disaggregation (COVERAGE)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Data availability:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Data is currently collected for <del class="diffmod">140</del><ins class="diffmod">139</ins> countries from 1990 to 2019, excluding &#x201C;<del class="diffdel">High Income&#x201D; or &#x201C;</del>Developed&#x201D; countries<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;as</del> classified by the United Nations. </p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Time series:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Data for countries have been compiled for the 1990-2019 period, though there are gaps in accurate data availability.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Disaggregation:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Electricity access rates are disaggregated by geographic location into total, urban and rural rates. Countries that are classified as &#x201C;Developed&#x201D; or &#x201C;High Income&#x201D; are assumed to have 100 percent from the first year it was added to the category. Disaggregation of access to electricity by rural or urban place of residence is possible for all countries.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">6. Comparability/deviation from international standards (COMPARABILITY)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Sources of discrepancies:</ins></strong></p>
<p>The World Bank database compiles electricity usage data, while many international agencies and national ministries report electricity production data. This is the main cause for data discrepancies. The quality and accuracy of population data can also lead to differences in assessing electrification.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">7.
