<p>The proportion of children aged 24 to 59 months who are developmentally on track in health, learning and psychosocial well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p>The domains included in the indicator for SDG indicator 4.2.1 include the following concepts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Health</strong>: gross motor development, fine motor development and self-care<ins class="diffins">.</ins></li>
  <li><strong>Learning</strong>: expressive language, literacy, numeracy, pre-writing, and executive functioning<ins class="diffins">.</ins></li>
  <li><strong>Psychosocial well-being: </strong>emotional skills, social skills, internalizing behavior, and externalizing behavior<ins class="diffins">.</ins></li>
</ul>
<p>The recommended measure for SDG 4.2.1 is the Early Childhood Development Index 2030 (ECDI2030) which is a 20-item instrument to measure developmental outcomes among children aged 24 to 59 months in population-based surveys. The indicator derived from the ECDI2030 is the proportion of children aged 24 to 59 months who have achieved the minimum number of milestones expected for their age group, defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Children age 24 to 29 months are classified as developmentally on-track if they have achieved at least 7 milestones;</li>
  <li>Children age 30 to 35 months are classified as developmentally on-track if they have achieved at least 9 milestones;</li>
  <li>Children age 36 to 41 months are classified as developmentally on-track if they have achieved at least 11 milestones;</li>
  <li>Children age 42 to 47 months are classified as developmentally on-track if they have achieved at least 13 milestones;</li>
  <li>Children age 48 to 59 months are classified as developmentally on-track if they have achieved at least 15 milestones. </li>
</ul></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">2.b.

Data sources (SOURCE_TYPE)</div></div></div><p>In 2015, UNICEF initiated a process of methodological development that involved extensive consultations with experts, partner agencies and national statistical authorities. Over the following five years, a sequence of carefully planned technical steps were executed, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative methods to identify the best items to measure indicator 4.2.1. This process led to the development of the ECDI2030.</p>
<p>The ECDI2030 addresses the need for nationally representative and internationally comparable data on early childhood development, collected in a standardized way. It captures the achievement of key developmental milestones by children between the ages of 24 and 59 months. Mothers or primary caregivers are asked 20 questions about the way their children behave in certain everyday situations, and the skills and knowledge they have acquired.</p>
<p>The ECDI2030 can be integrated into existing national data collection efforts, including international household survey programmes such as UNICEF-supported <ins class="diffins">Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (</ins>MICS<ins class="diffins">)</ins> and the Demographic and Health Surveys<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;(DHS)</ins>. </p>
<p>The ECDI2030 is meant to replace the Early Childhood Development Index (or ECDI) which collects data on the proxy indicator for SDG 4.2.1 that has been in use since 2015. The former ECDI and the new ECDI2030 target different age groups and measure slightly different development domains. Therefore, the indicators generated by both instruments may not be fully comparable and caution is needed when interpreting estimates produced by the two measures.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">3.b.

      <li>UNICEF undertakes a wide consultative process of compiling and assessing data from national sources for the purposes of updating its global databases on the situation of children. Up until 2017, the mechanism UNICEF used to collaborate with national authorities on ensuring data quality and international comparability on key indicators of relevance to children was known as Country Data Reporting on the Indicators for the Goals (CRING).</li>

</ul>
<p>As of 2018, UNICEF launched a new country consultation process with national authorities on selected child-related global SDG indicators <ins class="diffins">for which </ins>it is custodian or co-custodian to meet emerging standards and guidelines on data flows for global reporting of SDG indicators, which place strong emphasis on technical rigour, country ownership and use of official data and statistics.

Quality assurance (QUALITY_ASSURE)</div></div></div><p>UNICEF maintains the global database on ECD that is used for SDG and other official reporting. Before the inclusion of any data point in the database, it is reviewed by technical focal points at UNICEF headquarters to check for consistency and overall data quality. This review is based on a set of objective criteria to ensure that only the most recent and reliable information are included in the databases. These criteria include the following: data sources must include proper documentation; data values must be representative at the national population level; data are collected using an appropriate methodology (e.g., sampling); data values are based on a sufficiently large sample; data conform to the standard indicator definition including age group and concepts, to the extent possible; data are plausible based on trends and consistency with previously published/reported estimates for the indicator. </p>
<p>As of 2018, UNICEF undertakes an annual consultation with government authorities on 10 of the child-related SDG indicators in its role of sole or joint custodian, and in line with its global monitoring mandate and normative commitments to advancing the 2030 Agenda for children. This includes indicator 4.2.1. <del class="diffdel">More details on the process for the country consultation are outlined below.</del></p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.k.
