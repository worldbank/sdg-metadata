Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
<p>The conservation of plant and animal genetic resources for food and agriculture (GRFA) in medium<ins class="diffins">-</ins> or long<del class="diffmod">&nbsp;</del><ins class="diffmod">-</ins>term conservation facilities (<em>ex situ</em>, in genebanks) represents the most trusted means of conserving genetic resources worldwide. Plant and animal GRFA conserved in these facilities can be easily used in breeding programmes as well, even directly on-farm.</p>
<p>The measure of trends in <em>ex situ</em> conserved materials provides an overall assessment of the extent to which we are managing to maintain and/or increase the total genetic diversity available for future use and thus protected from any permanent loss of genetic diversity which may occur in the natural habitat, i.e. <em>in situ</em>, or on-farm.</p>
<p>The two components of the indicator 2.5.1, plant (a) and animal (b) GRFA, are separately counted.</p>
<p>The plant component is calculated as the number of accessions of plant genetic resources secured in conservation facilities under medium<ins class="diffins">-</ins> or long<del class="diffmod">&nbsp;</del><ins class="diffmod">-</ins>term conditions, where an &#x2018;accession&#x2019; is defined as a distinct sample of seeds, planting materials or plants which is maintained in a genebank. Genebank Standards for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (accessible at <a href="http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/7b79ee93-0f3c-5f58-9adc-5d4ef063f9c7/">http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/7b79ee93-0f3c-5f58-9adc-5d4ef063f9c7/</a>), set the benchmark for current scientific and technical best practices for conserving plant genetic resources, and support key international policy instruments for the conservation and use of plant genetic resources. These voluntary standards have been endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at its Fourteenth Regular Session (<a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/028/mg538e.pdf">http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/028/mg538e.pdf</a>). </p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p>Plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (PGRFA): Any genetic material of plant origin of actual or potential value for food and agriculture.</p>
<p>Accession: An accession is defined as a sample of seeds, planting materials or plants representing either a wild population, a landrace, a breeding line or an improved cultivar, which is conserved in a genebank. Each accession should be distinct and, in terms of genetic integrity, as close as possible to the sample provided originally.</p>
<p>Base collection: A base collection is defined as a set of unique accessions to be preserved for a medium to long-term period.</p>
<p>Active collection: An active collection is defined as a set of distinct accessions that is used for regeneration, multiplication, distribution, characterization and evaluation. Active collections are maintained in short to medium-term storage and usually duplicated in a base collection. </p>
<p>Medium<ins class="diffins">-</ins> or long<del class="diffmod">&nbsp;</del><ins class="diffmod">-</ins>term conservation facilities: Biological diversity is often conserved <em>ex situ</em>, outside its natural habitat, in facilities called genebanks. In the case of plant genetic resources, genebanks conserve base collections under medium<ins class="diffins">-</ins> or long<del class="diffmod">&nbsp;</del><ins class="diffmod">-</ins>term storage conditions, in the form of seeds in cold rooms, plants in the field and tissues <em>in vitro</em> and/or cryoconserved. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">3.a. Data sources (SOURCE_TYPE)</div></div></div><p>Data are sourced from officially appointed National Focal Points (<del class="diffmod">NFP</del><ins class="diffmod">NFPs</ins>) (see <a href="http://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/thematic-sitemap/theme/seeds-pgr/gpa/national-focal-points/en/">http://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/thematic-sitemap/theme/seeds-pgr/gpa/national-focal-points/en/</a>) and regional and international agricultural research centres holding PGRFA <em>ex situ</em> collections. Data providers report either (i) directly to FAO by using the spreadsheet contained in document List of descriptors for reporting on the Plant Component of SDG indicator 2.5.1 (see References) accessible from the WIEWS home page (<a href="http://www.fao.org/wiews">http://www.fao.org/wiews</a>) or (ii) through published information systems which comply with the standard of the FAO/Bioversity Multi-crop Passport Descriptor List (MCPD) v. 2 (see References), e.g. EURISCO (<a href="http://eurisco.ipk-gatersleben.de/">http://eurisco.ipk-gatersleben.de/</a>) and Genesys (<a href="https://www.genesys-pgr.org">https://www.genesys-pgr.org</a>). </p>
<p>Data are stored in the World Information and Early Warning System for plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (WIEWS - <a href="http://www.fao.org/wiews">http://www.fao.org/wiews</a>), the FAO platform established to facilitate information exchange as well as periodic assessments of the state of the world&#x2019;s plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">3.f.

Rationale (RATIONALE)</div></div></div><p>Genetic resources for food and agriculture provide the building blocks of food security and, directly or indirectly, support the livelihoods of every person on earth. As the conservation and accessibility to these resources are of vital importance, medium- or long- term conservation facilities (genebanks) to preserve and make these resources and their associated information accessible for breeding and research have been established at country, regional and global levels. Inventories of genebank holdings provide a dynamic measure of the existing plant and animal diversity and its level of preservation. Data relevant to this indicator facilitate the monitoring of diversity secured and accessible through genebanks and support the development and updating of strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources.</p>
<p>The indicator is related to a monitoring framework endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture in which the status and trends of plant and animal genetic resources are described through globally agreed indicators and regular country-driven assessments. </p>
<p>The number of materials conserved under medium- or long-term storage conditions provides an indirect measurement of the total genetic diversity, which are managed to secure for future use. Overall, positive variations are therefore approximated to an increase in the agro-biodiversity secured, while negative variations to a loss of it. </p>
<p>Caution needs to be paid in the reporting and interpretation of the indicator. In the case of plant genetic resources, an uncontrolled addition of accessions that are in fact duplicates of samples already conserved and accounted for, or, <em>vice versa</em>, the deletion from the reported collections of redundant duplicates may lead to wrong interpretations. In order to avoid duplicate counting at the national level, primarily base collections should be reported. An active collection could be reported, only when, in the absence of a base collection, it also serves the function of the base collection.<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;</ins>Another example that needs to be monitored both while reporting and interpreting the results include the grouping or splitting of accessions, as in both cases the variation in the accounted number does not reflect a variation in the genetic diversity conserved and secured. Therefore, it is crucial that reporting countries and regional/international centres together with the accession level information requested explain also the reason for the decrease or increase in the number of accessions, in particular when this does not reflect a real loss or gain in the genetic diversity conserved and secured.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.b. Comment and limitations (REC_USE_LIM)</div></div></div><p>Broadly, two issues are of concern in using the &#x201C;number of accessions&#x201D; as an indicator of diversity in <em>ex situ</em> collections:</p>
<p>Undetected duplicates of accessions may contribute to an increase of the indicator, as each accession is a managed unit, kept and recorded as distinct. The detection of such duplicates will therefore result in a reduction in the number of <del class="diffmod">accession</del><ins class="diffmod">accessions</ins> previously reported. This can occur at different levels, for example within genebank collections and also at international level.</p>
<p>A loss of viability of the material(s) conserved that is not promptly detected may similarly not be reflected in the number of accessions, contributing to an overestimate of the actual number of accessions.</p>
<p>Additional information could be provided by other indicators measuring <em>ex situ</em> conservation, which are part of the monitoring of the implementation of the Global Plan of Action for PGRFA under the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.e.

Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level (DOC_METHOD)</div></div></div><p>Officially appointed National Focal Points and managers of regional or international genebanks are requested to provide the list of accessions conserved in medium or long term conservation facilities by filling a spreadsheet contained in document <em>List of descriptors for reporting on the Plant Component of SDG indicator 2.5.1</em> (see References) accessible from the World Information and Early Warning System for plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (WIEWS) home page (<a href="http://www.fao.org/wiews">http://www.fao.org/wiews</a>). Out of the <del class="diffmod">12</del><ins class="diffmod">13</ins> passport descriptors which can be used to characterize each accession, four are mandatory: (i) the name of the genebank (or <em>holding institute code</em>); (ii) the <em>accession number</em><sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[1]</a></sup>; (iii) the scientific name of the accession (<em>name of taxon</em>, including genus, species and lower taxonomic ranking); and (iv) the type of storage. </p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p>Reporting on the remaining descriptors is highly recommended, as it allows the analysis of changes in different types of diversity concerned, including changes in the type and origin of the material secured (e.g. <em>biological status</em>; <em>country of origin</em>; <em>locations of safety duplications</em>; etc.) and better describes the composition of the secured materials. The descriptors have been agreed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (see question 6.2 in the <em>Reporting format for monitoring the implementation of the Second global Plan of Action for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture</em> <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-mm294e.pdf">http://www.fao.org/3/a-mm294e.pdf</a>).
