Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Definition:</ins></strong></p>
<p>The indicator Coverage by protected areas of important sites for mountain biodiversity shows temporal trends in the mean percentage of each important site for mountain biodiversity (i.e., those that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity) that is covered by designated protected areas and Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs).</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Concepts:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Protected areas, as defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN; Dudley 2008), are clearly defined geographical spaces, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values. Importantly, a variety of specific management objectives are recognised within this definition, spanning conservation, restoration, and sustainable use:</p>
<p>- Category Ia: Strict nature reserve</p>
<p>- Category Ib: Wilderness area</p>
<p>- Category II: National park</p>
<p>- Category III: Natural monument or feature</p>
<p>- Category IV: Habitat/species management area</p>
<p>- Category V: Protected landscape/seascape</p>
<p>- Category VI: Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources</p>
<p>The status &quot;designated&quot; is attributed to a protected area when the corresponding authority, according to national legislation or common practice (e.g., by means of an executive decree or the like), officially endorses a document of designation. The designation must be made for the purpose of biodiversity conservation, not de facto protection arising because of some other activity (e.g., military).</p>
<p>Data on protected areas are managed in the World Database on Protected Areas (www.protectedplanet.net) by the UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC).</p>
<p>Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures are defined by the Convention on Biological Diversity as (CBD) &#x201C;A geographically defined area other than a Protected Area, which is governed and managed in ways that achieve positive and sustained long-term outcomes for the in situ conservation of biodiversity, with associated ecosystem functions and services and where applicable, cultural, spiritual, socio&#x2013;economic, and other locally relevant values&#x201D; (CBD, 2018). Data on OECMs are managed in the World Database on OECMs (<a href="http://www.protectedplanet.net/en/thematic-areas/oecms">www.protectedplanet.net/en/thematic-areas/oecms</a>) by the UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC).</p>
<p>Sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity are identified following globally criteria set out in A Global Standard for the Identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) (IUCN 2016) applied at national levels. Key Biodiversity Areas encompass (a) Important Bird &amp; Biodiversity Areas, that is, sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, identified using data on birds, of which more than 13,000 sites in total have been identified from all of the world&#x2019;s countries (BirdLife International 2014, Donald et al. 2018); (b) Alliance for Zero Extinction sites (Ricketts et al. 2005), that is, sites holding effectively the entire population of at least one species assessed as Critically Endangered or Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, of which 853 sites have been identified for 1,483 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, freshwater crustaceans, reef-building corals, conifers, cycads and other taxa; (c) Key Biodiversity Areas identified under an earlier version of the Key Biodiversity Area criteria (Langhammer et al. 2007), including those identified in Ecosystem Hotspot Profiles developed with support of the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund. These three subsets are being reassessed using the Global Standard, which unifies these approaches along with other mechanisms for identification of important sites for other species and ecosystems (IUCN 2016).</p>
<p>Data on KBAs are managed in the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas (www.keybiodiversityareas.org/kba-data) by BirdLife International on behalf of the Key Biodiversity Areas Partnership.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.f.

<p>Data are available for protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas in all of the world&#x2019;s countries, and so no imputation or estimation of national level data is necessary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">&#x2022; At regional and global levels</ins></strong></p>
<p>Global indicators of protected area coverage of important sites for biodiversity are calculated as the mean percentage of each Key Biodiversity Area that is covered by protected areas and Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures. The data are generated from all countries, and so while there is uncertainty around the data, there are no missing values as such and so no need for imputation or estimation.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.h. Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level (DOC_METHOD)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod"><em>Protected areas</em></ins></strong></p>
<p>Data on protected areas are submitted by government agencies to the World Database on Protected Areas and disseminated through Protected Planet. The WDPA has its origins in a 1959 UN mandate when the United Nations Economic and Social Council called for a list of national parks and equivalent reserves Resolution 713 (XXVIII). More details are available here: https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas. The UN List of Protected Areas has been published in 1961/62, 1966/71, 1972 (addendum to the 1966/71 edition), 1973, 1974, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1985, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2003, 2014 and 2018 which have resulted in a global network of national data providers for the WDPA. For example, in 2014 all Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) National Focal points and all National Focal points for the CBD Protected Areas Programme of Work (PoWPA) to request data for the 2014 Un List of Protected Areas (<a href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas-2014">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas-2014</a>). Protected areas data are therefore compiled directly from government agencies, regional hubs and other authoritative sources in the absence of a government source. All records have a unique metadata identifier (MetadataID) which links the spatial database to the Source table where all sources are described. The data is collated and standardised following the WDPA Data Standards and validated with the source. The process of collation, validation and publication of data as well as protocols and the WDPA data standards are regularly updated in the WDPA User Manual (<a href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual</a>) made available through www.protectedplanet.net where all spatial data and the Source table are also published every month and can be downloaded. The WDPA User Manual (published in English, Spanish, and French) provides guidance to countries on how to submit protected areas data to the WDPA, the benefits of providing such data, and the data standards and quality checks that are performed. </p>

<p><em>Key Biodiversity Areas</em></p>
<p>The &#x201C;Global Standard for the Identification of Key Biodiversity Areas&#x201D; (<a href="https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259">https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259</a>) comprises the standard recommendations available to countries in the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas. Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas are available at https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/49131.</p>
<p>Guidance on Proposing, Reviewing, Nominating and Confirming KBAs is available in KBA Secretariat (2019) at <a href="http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/assets/35687f50ac0bcad155ab17447b48885a">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/assets/35687f50ac0bcad155ab17447b48885a</a>.</p>
<p>A summary of the process by which Key Biodiversity Areas are identified is available at <a href="http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/working-with-kbas/proposing-updating">www.keybiodiversityareas.org/working-with-kbas/proposing-updating</a>.</p>
<p>The KBA identification process is highly inclusive, consultative and nationally driven. Anyone with appropriate data may propose a site as a KBA, although consultation with relevant stakeholders at the local and national level is required when identifying the site and needs to be documented in the proposal. In order to propose a site as a KBA, a proposer must apply the KBA criteria to data on biodiversity elements (species and ecosystems) at the site. Associated with the proposal process is the need to delineate the site accurately so that its boundaries are clear. Although anyone with appropriate scientific data may propose a site to qualify as a Key Biodiversity Area, wide consultation with stakeholders at the national level (both non-governmental and governmental organizations) is required during the proposal process. The formal proposal is then made using a proposal process that ensures there is an independent review of the proposal before a site is incorporated in the World Database of KBAs. This is important given that KBA status of a site may lead to changes in actions of governments, private sector companies and other institutions following consultation as appropriate. </p>
<p>Key Biodiversity Area identification builds off the existing network of Key Biodiversity Areas, including those identified as (a) Important Bird &amp; Biodiversity Areas through the BirdLife Partnership of 120 national organisations (<a href="http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife-partners">http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife-partners</a>), (b) Alliance for Zero Extinction sites by 93 national and international organisations in the Alliance (<a href="http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html">http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html</a>), and (c) other Key Biodiversity Areas by civil society organisations supported by the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund in developing ecosystem profiles, named in each of the profiles listed here (<a href="http://www.cepf.net/resources/publications/Pages/ecosystem_profiles.aspx">http://www.cepf.net/resources/publications/Pages/ecosystem_profiles.aspx</a>), with new data strengthening and expanding expand the network of these sites.</p>
<p>The main steps of the Key Biodiversity Area identification process are the following: </p>
<ol>
  <li>submission of Expressions of Intent to identify a Key Biodiversity Area to Regional Focal Points; </li>
  <li>Proposal Development process, in which proposers compile relevant data and documentation and consult national experts, including organizations that have already identified Key Biodiversity Areas in the country, either through national Key Biodiversity Area Coordination Groups or independently;</li>
  <li>review of proposed Key Biodiversity Areas by Independent Expert Reviewers, verifying the accuracy of information within their area of expertise; and</li>
  <li>a Site Nomination phase comprising the submission of all the relevant documentation for verification by the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat. Sites confirmed by the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat to qualify as Key Biodiversity Areas are then published on the Key Biodiversity Areas website (<a href="http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Once a Key Biodiversity Area is identified, monitoring of its qualifying features and its conservation status is important. Proposers, reviewers and those undertaking monitoring can join the Key Biodiversity Areas Community to exchange their experiences, case studies and best practice examples.</p>
<p>The R code for calculating protected area coverage of Key Biodiversity Areas is documented in Simkins et al. (2020). </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">5. Data availability and disaggregation (COVERAGE)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Data availability:</ins></strong></p>
<p>This indicator has been classified by the IAEG-SDGs as Tier 1. Current data are available for all countries in the world, and these are updated on an ongoing basis. Index values for each country are available in the UN SDG Indicators Database <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/">https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/</a>. Graphs of Protected area coverage of Key Biodiversity Areas are also available for each country in the BIP Indicators Dashboard (<a href="https://bipdashboard.natureserve.org/bip/SelectCountry.html">https://bipdashboard.natureserve.org/bip/SelectCountry.html</a>), and the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool Country Profiles (<a href="https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles">https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles</a>).</p>
<p>Underlying data on protected areas and Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures are available at <a href="http://www.protectedplanet.net">www.protectedplanet.net</a>. Data on Key Biodiversity Areas are available at <a href="http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org">www.keybiodiversityareas.org</a>. Data on subsets of KBAs are available for Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas at <a href="http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/search">http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/search</a> and for Alliance for Zero Extinction sites at https://zeroextinction.org.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Disaggregation:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Given that data for the global indicator are compiled at national levels, it is straightforward to disaggregate to national and regional levels (e.g., Han et al. 2014), or conversely to aggregate to the global level. Key Biodiversity Areas span all ecosystem types through the marine environment (Edgar et al. 2008) and beyond. The indicator can therefore be reported in combination across marine systems along with terrestrial or freshwater systems, or disaggregated among them. However, individual Key Biodiversity Areas can encompass marine, terrestrial, and freshwater systems simultaneously, and so determining the results is not simply additive. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">6. Comparability/deviation from international standards (COMPARABILITY)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Sources of discrepancies:</ins></strong></p>
<p>National processes provide the data that are incorporated into the World Database on Protected Areas, the World Database on Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures, and the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, so there are very few discrepancies between national indicators and the global one. One minor source of difference is that the World Database on Protected Areas incorporates internationally-designated protected areas (e.g., UNESCO World Heritage sites, Ramsar sites, etc), a few of which are not considered by their sovereign nations to be protected areas. </p>
<p>Note that because countries do not submit comprehensive data on degazetted protected areas to the WDPA, earlier values of the indictor may marginally underestimate coverage. Furthermore, there is also a lag between the point at which a protected area is designated on the ground and the point at which it is reported to the WDPA. As such, current or recent coverage may also be underestimated.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">7.
