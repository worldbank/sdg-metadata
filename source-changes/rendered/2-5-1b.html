Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
<p>The conservation of plant and animal genetic resources for food and agriculture (GRFA) in medium- or long-term conservation facilities (<em>ex situ</em>, in genebanks) represents the most trusted means of conserving genetic resources worldwide. Plant and animal GRFA conserved in these facilities can be easily used in breeding programmes as well, even directly on-farm.</p>
<p>The measure of trends in <em>ex situ</em> conserved materials provides an overall assessment of the extent to which we are managing to maintain and/or increase the total genetic diversity available for future use and thus protected from any permanent loss of genetic diversity which may occur in the natural habitat, i.e. <em>in situ</em>, or on-farm.</p>
<p>The two components of the indicator 2.5.1, plant (a) and animal (b) GRFA, are separately counted.</p>
<p><em>Animal genetic resources</em> </p>
<p>The animal component is calculated as the number of local <del class="diffdel">breeds </del>(i.e. being reported to exist only in one country) <ins class="diffins">and transboundary (i.e. being reported to exist in more than one country) breeds with material </ins>stored within a genebank collection with an amount of genetic material<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;stored</del> which is required to reconstitute the breed in case of extinction (further information on &#x201C;sufficient material stored to reconstitute a breed&#x201D; can be found in the Guidelines on Cryoconservation of Animal Genetic Resources, FAO, 2012, accessible at <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm">http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm</a>). The guidelines have been endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at its Thirteenth Regular Session (http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/024/mc192e.pdf).</p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p><em>Animal genetic resources</em></p>
<p>Breed: A breed is either a sub-specific group of domestic livestock with definable and identifiable external characteristics that enable it to be separated by visual appraisal from other similarly defined groups within the same species, or a group for which geographical and/or cultural separation from phenotypically similar groups has led to acceptance of its separate identity. </p>
<p>Medium- or long-term conservation facilities: Biological diversity is often conserved <em>ex situ</em>, outside its natural habitat, in facilities called genebanks. In the case of domestic animal diversity, <em>ex situ</em> conservation includes both the maintenance of live animals (<em>in vivo</em>) and cryoconservation. </p>
<p>Cryoconservation is the collection and deep-freezing of semen, ova, embryos or tissues for potential future use in breeding or regenerating animals.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">2.b.

To decide whether the material stored is sufficient on regional or global levels the numbers provided to DAD-IS for each type of material (e.g. semen samples, embryos, somatic cells) conserved within the framework of a cryconservation programme, as well as the number of the respective male and female donor animals, must be summed across the countries belonging to the respective region of interest.</ins></p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">5. Data availability and disaggregation (COVERAGE)</div></div></div><p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><em><ins class="diffins">Animal genetic resources</ins></em></p>
<p>The analysis of country reports to FAO provided by 128 countries in 2014 for the preparation of &#x2018;The Second Report on the State of the World&#x2019;s Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture&#x2019; provided a first baseline with regard to the number of national breed populations where sufficient material is stored. However, currently genetic material is cryo-conserved for only a very low proportion (less than 10 percent), whereas the quantity of stored material is sufficient for population reconstitution for an even smaller percentage of local breeds.</p>
<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>
<p>DAD-IS data are available since 2000<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;up to 2022</del>.</p>
<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>
<p>For both plant and animal components geographic disaggregation (national, regional, global) is made. Grouping by sex, age etc. is not applicable.</p></div>
