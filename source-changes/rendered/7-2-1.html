Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Definition:</ins></strong></p>
<p>The renewable energy share in total final consumption is the percentage of final consumption of energy that is derived from renewable resources.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Concepts:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Renewable energy consumption includes consumption of energy derived from: hydro, wind, solar, solid biofuels, liquid biofuels, biogas, geothermal, marine and renewable waste. Total final energy consumption is calculated from balances as total final consumption minus non-energy use. </p>
<p>Comments with regard to specific renewable energy sources: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Solar energy includes solar PV and solar thermal. </li>
  <li>Liquid biofuels include biogasoline, biodiesels and other liquid biofuels. </li>
  <li>Solid biofuels include fuelwood, animal waste, vegetable waste, black liquor, bagasse and charcoal. </li>
  <li>Renewable waste energy covers energy from renewable municipal waste.</li>

Treatment of missing values (i) at country level and (ii) at regional level (IMPUTATION)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">&#x2022; At country level</ins></strong></p>
<p>The IEA has attempted to provide all the elements of energy balances down to the level of final consumption, for over 150 countries. Providing all the elements of supply, as well as all inputs and outputs of the main transformation activities and final consumption has often required estimations. Estimations have been generally made after consultation with national statistical offices, energy companies, utilities and national energy experts.</p>
<p>Likewise, UNSD attempts to provide full energy balances for the 225 countries and areas it covers, including the 75 or so it covers for SDG reporting. This may require searching for national official publications, data from other international organizations and expert estimation based on reputable sources and other publicly available information. Generally speaking, data on the supply side is more widely available than transformation activities and final consumption.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">&#x2022; At regional and global levels</ins></strong></p>
<p>In addition to estimates at a country level, adjustments addressing differences in definitions alongside estimations for informal and/or confidential trade, production or consumption of energy products are sometimes required to complete major aggregates, when key statistics are missing. Such estimations and adjustments implemented by IEA have been generally made after consultation with national statistical offices, energy companies, utilities and national energy experts.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">5. Data availability and disaggregation (COVERAGE)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Data availability:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Between the various existing data sources, primarily the IEA World Energy Balances and the UN Energy Statistics Database, annual total and renewable energy consumption for every country and area can be collected. The Tracking SDG7: The Energy Progress Report (formerly <em>Sustainable Energy for All Global Tracking Framework</em>) is reporting this indicator at a global level between 1990 and 2030. </p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Time series:</ins></strong></p>
<p>2000 &#x2013; present</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Disaggregation:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Disaggregation of the data on consumption of renewable energy, e.g. by resource and end-use sector, could provide insights into other dimensions of the goal, such as affordability and reliability. For solar energy, it may also be of interest to disaggregate between on grid and off-grid capacity.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">6. Comparability/deviation from international standards (COMPARABILITY)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Sources of discrepancies:</ins></strong></p>
<p>The IEA World energy balances and the UN Energy Statistics Database, which provide the underlying data for calculating this indicator, are global databases obtained following harmonised definitions and comparable methodologies across countries. However, they do not represent an official source for national submissions of the indicator 7.2.1 on renewable energy. Due to possible deviations from IRES in national methodologies, national indicators may differ from the internationally comparable ones.</p>
<p>Difference may arise due to different sources of official energy data, dissimilarities in the underlying methodologies, adjustments and estimations.</p></div>
