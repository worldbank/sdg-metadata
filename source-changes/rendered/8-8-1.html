Comment and limitations (REC_USE_LIM)</div></div></div><p>There may be problems of underreporting of occupational injuries, and proper systems should be put in place to ensure the best reporting and data quality. Underreporting is thought to be present in countries at all levels of development but may be particularly problematic in some developing countries. Data users should be aware of this issue when analysing the data. Double<del class="diffmod">-</del><ins class="diffmod">&nbsp;</ins>counting of cases of occupational injury may also happen in cases where data from several registries (records kept by different agencies, for example) are consolidated to have more comprehensive statistics. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Because data quality issues may be present, it may be more relevant to analyse indicator trends rather than levels. When measured over a period of time, the data can reveal progress or deterioration in occupational safety and health, and thus point to the effectiveness of prevention measures. This indicator is volatile and strong annual fluctuations may occur due to unexpected but significant accidents or national calamities. The underlying trend should therefore be analysed. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.d.

<p><strong>Time series:</strong> </p>
<p>The submission covers data from 2000 to <del class="diffmod">2020</del><ins class="diffmod">2021</ins>.</p>
<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>
<p>This indicator should be disaggregated by both sex and migrant status. </p>
<p>Wherever possible, it would also be useful to have information disaggregated by economic activity and occupation. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">6. Comparability/deviation from international standards (COMPARABILITY)</div></div></div><p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>
<p>The variety of possible sources of data on occupational injuries hinders the comparability of data across countries since each type of source provides information on different specific concepts. Data derived from administrative records are not strictly comparable since they include numerous types of records that follow different rules and are maintained by different agencies. Two main sources of data are records of notifications by employers to the competent authority and insurance records of the authority compensating the victims. These two would clearly yield different results, since it is possible that not all injuries that were compensated to workers were reported by the employer and vice versa. It is also possible that these records have a different geographical coverage or that they cover different economic activities.</p>
<p>When statistics come from an establishment survey, the results would be closer to those from records of notifications made by employers since it is also the employer who provides the establishment survey information. However, establishment surveys tend not to cover the informal sector, establishments of a very small size and sometimes the agricultural sector. </p>
<p>When statistics come from a household survey, their reliability depends heavily on the accuracy of the respondents, who may be subjective in the information given.<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;</ins></p>
