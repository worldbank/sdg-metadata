  <li><strong><ins class="mod">At country level</ins></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Sub-indicator (a): Missing values are not imputed. </p>
<p>Sub-indicator (b): Missing values will occur if a country does not respond to the Global Assessment. If a country does not respond, missing values will be imputed if the custodian agency can find evidence of implementation, such as online publications of SEEA accounts, or based on information gathered from international organizations on the compilation of SEEA accounts. In particular:</p>
<p> -If a national statistical office or other government institution has published a SEEA account which is easily accessible online, this country will be imputed as compiling the SEEA. Since no assumption can be made that the country regularly compiles and publishes the account, this country would fall under Stage II.</p>
<p> -If the custodian agency finds that a country compiles SEEA accounts through a project or other implementation programme and verifies this with the international organizations involved, this country will be imputed as compiling the SEEA under Stage I or Stage II as appropriate.</p>
<p>In all cases, imputation is only be done as a secondary step after first contacting countries. All imputations will be clearly flagged for users as imputations by UNSD. </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><ins class="mod">At regional and global levels</ins></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Sub-indicator (a) Missing values are considered to be 0 as this indicator refers to reporting processes. Thus if a country does not report it is assumed that there is no corresponding national target.</p>
<p>Sub-indicator (b): A simple count of countries will be used.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">5.

<p>For Sub-indicator (a), there have been six rounds of national reporting to date. The most recent round of national reporting had a deadline of 31 December 2018. </p>
<p>For Sub-indicator (b), the Global Assessment was last sent to national statistical offices in August 2020. A Global Assessment will be administered annually.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Time series:</ins></strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Collection of NBSAPs and National Reports is regularly updated by the CBD Secretariat (see <a href="https://www.cbd.int/nbsap/">https://www.cbd.int/nbsap/</a> and <a href="https://www.cbd.int/reports/"><u>https://www.cbd.int/reports/</u></a>). Under the Convention, national reporting typically occurs every 4 years.</li>
  <li>The reports for previous Global Assessments can be found here: <a href="https://seea.un.org/content/global-assessment-environmental-economic-accounting"><u>https://seea.un.org/content/global-assessment-environmental-economic-accounting</u></a>. Data on SEEA implementation will be collected every year, with the full detailed questionnaire being sent approximately every three years.</li>
