<p>The indicator &#x201C;proportion of the population below the international poverty line&#x201D; is defined as the percentage of the population living on less than $<del class="diffmod">1</del><ins class="diffmod">2</ins>.<del class="diffmod">90</del><ins class="diffmod">15</ins> a day at <del class="diffmod">2011</del><ins class="diffmod">2017</ins> international prices. </p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p>In assessing poverty in a given country, and how best to reduce poverty, one naturally focuses on a poverty line that is considered appropriate for that country. But how do we talk meaningfully about &#x201C;global poverty?&#x201D; Poverty lines across countries vary in terms of their purchasing power, and they have a strong economic gradient, such that richer countries tend to adopt higher standards of living in defining poverty. But to consistently measure global absolute poverty in terms of consumption we need to treat two people with the same purchasing power over commodities the same way&#x2014;both are either poor or not poor&#x2014;even if they live in different countries.</p>
<p>Since World Development Report 1990, the World Bank has aimed to apply a common standard in measuring extreme poverty, anchored to what poverty means in the world&apos;s poorest countries. The welfare of people living in different countries can be measured on a common scale by adjusting for differences in the purchasing power of currencies. The commonly used $1 a day standard, measured in 1985 international prices and adjusted to local currency using PPPs, was chosen for World Development Report 1990 because it was typical of the poverty lines in low-income countries at the time. As differences in the cost of living across the world evolve, the international poverty line has to be periodically updated using new PPP price data to reflect these changes. The last change was in <del class="diffmod">October</del><ins class="diffmod">September</ins> <del class="diffmod">2015</del><ins class="diffmod">2022</ins>, when the World Bank adopted $<del class="diffmod">1</del><ins class="diffmod">2</ins>.<del class="diffmod">90</del><ins class="diffmod">15</ins> as the international poverty line using the <del class="diffmod">2011</del><ins class="diffmod">2017</ins> PPP. Prior to that, the <del class="diffmod">2008</del><ins class="diffmod">2015</ins> update set the international poverty line at $1.<del class="diffmod">25</del><ins class="diffmod">90</ins> using the <del class="diffmod">2005</del><ins class="diffmod">2011</ins> PPP. Poverty measures based on international poverty lines attempt to hold the real value of the poverty line constant across countries, as is done when making comparisons over time. Early editions of the World Bank&#x2019;s World Development Indicators (WDI) used PPPs from the Penn World Tables to convert values in local currency to equivalent purchasing power measured in U.S dollars. Later editions used 1993, 2005, <del class="diffmod">and</del><ins class="diffmod">2011,</ins> <del class="diffmod">2011</del><ins class="diffmod">2017</ins> consumption PPP estimates produced by the World Bank&#x2019;s International Comparison Program (ICP).</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.a. Rationale (RATIONALE)</div></div></div><p>Monitoring poverty is important on the global development agenda as well as on the national development agenda of many countries. The World Bank produced its first global poverty estimates for developing countries for World Development Report 1990: Poverty (World Bank 1990) using household survey data for 22 countries (Ravallion, Datt, and van de Walle 1991). Since then there has been considerable expansion in the number of countries that field household income and expenditure surveys. The World Bank&apos;s Development Data Group and Poverty and Equity Global Practice maintain a database, PIP, that is updated annually as new survey data become available (and thus may contain more recent data or revisions) and conducts a major reassessment of progress against poverty every year. PIP is an interactive computational tool that allows users to replicate these internationally comparable $<del class="diffmod">1</del><ins class="diffmod">2</ins>.<del class="diffmod">90 and $3.20</del><ins class="diffmod">15</ins> a day global, regional and country-level poverty estimates and to compute poverty measures for<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;custom</del> country groupings and for different poverty lines. </p>
<p>PIP also provides access to the database and user-friendly dashboards with graphs and interactive maps that visualize trends in key poverty and inequality indicators for different regions and countries. The country dashboards display trends in poverty measures based on the national poverty lines alongside the internationally comparable estimates.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.c. Method of computation (DATA_COMP)</div></div></div><p>To measure poverty across countries consistently, the World Bank&#x2019;s international measures apply a common standard, anchored to what &#x201C;poverty&#x201D; means in the world&#x2019;s poorest countries. The original &#x201C;$1-a-day&#x201D; line was based on a compilation of national lines for only 22 developing countries, mostly from academic studies in the 1980s (Ravallion, et al., 1991). While this was the best that could be done at the time, the sample was hardly representative of developing countries even in the 1980s. Since then, national poverty lines have been developed for many other countries. Based on a <del class="diffdel">new </del>compilation of national lines for 75 developing countries, Ravallion, Chen and Sangraula (RCS) (2009) proposed a new international poverty line of $1.25 a day. This is the average poverty line for the poorest 15 countries in their data set. </p>
<p>The current extreme poverty line is set at $<del class="diffmod">1</del><ins class="diffmod">2</ins>.<del class="diffmod">90</del><ins class="diffmod">15</ins> a day in <del class="diffmod">2011</del><ins class="diffmod">2017</ins> PPP terms, which represents the mean of the national poverty lines found in <del class="diffmod">the</del><ins class="diffmod">28</ins> <del class="diffmod">same</del><ins class="diffmod">low</ins> <del class="diffmod">poorest 15</del><ins class="diffmod">income</ins> countries <del class="diffmod">ranked</del><ins class="diffmod">(Jolliffe</ins> <del class="diffmod">by</del><ins class="diffmod">&#x24E1;</ins> <del class="diffmod">per</del><ins class="diffmod">al</ins> <del class="diffmod">capita</del><ins class="diffmod">2022)</ins> <del class="diffdel">consumption</del>. The new poverty line maintains the same standard for extreme poverty - the poverty line typical of the poorest countries in the world - but updates it using the latest information on the cost of living in developing countries. </p>
<p>When measuring international poverty of a country, the international poverty line at PPP is converted to local currencies in <del class="diffmod">2011</del><ins class="diffmod">2017</ins> price and is then converted to the prices prevailing at the time of the relevant household survey using the best available Consumer Price Index (CPI). (Equivalently, the survey data on household consumption or income for the survey year are expressed in the prices of the ICP base year, and then converted to PPP $&#x2019;s.) Then the poverty rate is calculated from that survey. All inter-temporal comparisons are real, as assessed using the country-specific CPI. Interpolation/extrapolation methods are used to line up the survey-based estimates with these reference years.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">6. Comparability/deviation from international standards (COMPARABILITY)</div></div></div><p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>
<p>National poverty is a different concept than global poverty. National poverty rate is defined at country-specific poverty lines in local currencies, which are different in real terms across countries and different from the $<del class="diffmod">1</del><ins class="diffmod">2</ins>.<del class="diffmod">90</del><ins class="diffmod">15</ins>-a-day international poverty line. Thus, national poverty rates cannot be compared across countries or with the $<del class="diffmod">1</del><ins class="diffmod">2</ins>.<del class="diffmod">90</del><ins class="diffmod">15</ins>-a-day poverty rate.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">7.
