<p>The official <del class="diffmod">MDG</del><ins class="diffmod">SDG</ins> indicator is wasting as assessed using weight for height. Wasting can however also be assessed with mid upper arm circumference (MUAC). Estimates of wasting based on MUAC are not considered for the <ins class="diffins">JME </ins>joint <del class="diffmod">dataset</del><ins class="diffmod">database</ins>. In addition, while wasting constitutes the major form of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM), there are acutely malnourished children who would not be picked up with weight-for-height or MUAC, namely those presenting bilateral pitting <del class="diffmod">odema</del><ins class="diffmod">oedema</ins> (characterized by swollen feet, face and limbs). For <del class="diffmod">Surveys</del><ins class="diffmod">surveys</ins> that report <ins class="diffins">wasting including </ins>oedema cases,<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;in the joint data set</del> these are included in the prevalence of low weight-for-height<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;in the JME database unless raw data are available for re-analysis</ins>. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">3.a.

UNICEF actively supports countries in data collection and analysis for reporting on child malnutrition indicators primarily through high-quality MICS surveys, as well as providing technical and financial support to other surveys. UNICEF not only supports household surveys but also works with global partners to define technical standards for the collection and analysis of anthropometric data. UNICEF also compiles statistics on child nutrition with the goal of making internationally comparable estimates and databases publicly available. In-depth analyses of the data on child malnutrition, which are included in relevant data-driven publications, including in its flagship publication, </ins><em><ins class="mod"><ins class="diffins">The State of the World&#x2019;s Children,</ins></ins></em><ins class="diffins">&nbsp;and the </ins><em><ins class="mod"><ins class="diffins">Child Nutrition Report</ins></ins></em><ins class="diffins">&nbsp;are also conducted by UNICEF.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><ins class="diffins">WHO has an established role in the monitoring of child growth and malnutrition since the late 1980&#x2019;s and had the mandate to develop the WHO Child Growth Standards, launched in 2006, and adopted by more than 160 countries. WHO has published several per-reviewed articles with regional and global estimates until 2012, when they joined forces with UNICEF and the World Bank, with the objective of harmonizing child malnutrition estimates. WHO has the mandate to monitor and report progress on the six global nutrition targets, endorsed in 2012 by the World Health Assembly, amongst them, three on child malnutrition, namely stunting, overweight and wasting (SDG 2.2.1, 2.2.2 (1) and 2.2.2 (2)).</ins></p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.d. Validation (DATA_VALIDATION)</div></div></div><p><ins class="diffins">UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank undertake a joint review for each potential data source (e.g., household survey). The group conducts a review when (at minimum) a final report with full methodological details and results is available, as well as (ideally) a data quality assessment flagging potential limitations. When the raw data are available, they are analysed using the Anthro Survey Analyzer software to produce a standard set of results and data quality outputs against which the review is conducted . Comments are documented in a standard review template extracting methodological details (e.g., sampling procedures, description of anthropometrical equipment), data quality outputs (e.g., weight and height distributions, percentage of cases that were flagged as implausible according to the WHO Child Growth Standards) and the malnutrition prevalence estimates from the data source under review generated based on the standard recommended methodology. These estimates are compared against the reported values, as well as against those from other data sources already included in the JME database, to assess the plausibility of the trend before including the new point. Reports that are preliminary, or that lack key details on methodology or results, cannot be reviewed and are left pending until full information is available. Country consultations with SDG 2.2 focal points are also held every two years before finalizing and disseminating each edition of the JME estimates. The purpose of the country consultations is to ensure the wasting estimates included all recent and relevant country data and to engage with and receive feedback from national governments on the estimates. </ins></p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.e. Adjustments (ADJUSTMENT)</div></div></div><p><ins class="diffins">Adjustments to reported values are made in cases where raw data are not available for re-analysis and it is known from the report that the estimates were derived based on indicators that do not adhere to the standard definition used for monitoring of the SDGs (e.g., they are based on different growth references). The three types of adjustments that have been applied to the JME country dataset include adjustments to standardize for: (i) area of residence, specifically for data sources that were only nationally representative at the rural level; (ii) growth reference, specifically for data sources that used the 1977 NCHS/WHO Growth Reference instead of the 2006 WHO Growth Standards to generate the child malnutrition estimates; and (iii) age, specifically for data sources that did not include the full 0&#x2013;59-month age group (e.g., data sources reporting on 2&#x2013;4-year-olds). These three types of adjustments are described further in this section.</ins></p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffins">i. Adjustment from national rural to national</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><ins class="diffins">A number of surveys cover only rural areas, and, while they have been sampled to be nationally representative for the rural parts of the country, they did not sample any urban areas. Given that malnutrition prevalence generally varies between urban and rural areas (i.e., stunting prevalence was reported to be two times higher in rural areas compared to urban areas at the global level (5)), a rural-only survey would not be comparable with a national survey that are representative of both urban and rural areas. To improve comparability of the rural-only data sources for the specific country, it is necessary to account for urban populations in estimates from these surveys. </ins></p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><ins class="diffins">The adjustment method used by the JME group is to apply the relative proportions of malnutrition prevalence for each urban and rural area from the closest survey in the country&#x2019;s JME dataset includes disaggregated estimates by area of residence, to the survey that covers only rural areas. This is done under the assumption that the urban:rural population ratio remains the same as the survey with the disaggregations available (e.g., the proportion of children living in rural areas in the country is the same in the survey year used for the adjustment as in the survey year being adjusted) and also that relative prevalence of malnutrition across urban-rural areas in the survey with the missing data is the same as in the survey with full information used for the adjustment. </ins></p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffins">ii. Adjustment to use the 2006 WHO Growth Standard (converted estimates):</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><ins class="diffins">The indicators of stunting, wasting and overweight used to track SDG Target 2.2 require a standard deviation (SD) score (z-score) to be calculated for each child who is measured for a data source; and the z-score requires a growth reference against which it can be calculated. Prior to the release of the WHO Child Growth Standards in 2006, the 1977 NCHS/WHO reference was recommended for international comparisons. The WHO Growth Standard results in estimates of stunting and wasting prevalence that are higher as well as estimates of overweight that are lower than estimates generated using the NCHS/WHO growth reference (6). It was therefore necessary to account for these differences and standardize estimates across data sources. As such, data sources published prior to the release of the new growth standard in 2006 had to be re-analysed using the 2006 growth standards to obtain comparable estimates across time and location. When raw data were not available, a standard algorithm was applied to convert estimates from surveys based on the NCHS reference to estimates based on the WHO Growth Standards (7). </ins></p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><strong><ins class="diffins">iii. Age-adjustment</ins></strong></p><ins class="diffins">
