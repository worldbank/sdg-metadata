<p>The KBA identification process is highly inclusive and consultative. Anyone with appropriate data may propose a site. Consultation with stakeholders at the national level (both non-governmental and governmental organisations) is required during the proposal process. Any site proposal must undergo independent review. This is followed by the official site nomination with full documentation meeting the Documentation Standards for KBAs. Sites confirmed by the KBA Secretariat to qualify as KBAs are then published on the KBA Website.</p>
<p>Submission of proposals for KBAs to the <del class="diffmod">World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">WDKBA</ins> follows a systematic review process to ensure that the KBA criteria have been applied correctly and that the sites can be recognised as important for the global persistence of biodiversity. Regional Focal Points have been appointed to help KBA proposers develop proposals and then ensure they are reviewed independently. Guidance on Proposing, Reviewing, Nominating and Confirming sites has been published to help guide proposers through the development of proposals and the review process, highlighting where they can obtain help in making a proposal. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">3.c.

New data are validated at UNEP-WCMC through a number of tools and translated into the standard data structure of the <del class="diffmod">World Database on Protected Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">WDPA</ins>. Discrepancies between the data in the <del class="diffmod">World Database on Protected Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">WDPA</ins> and new data are minimised by provision of a manual (UNEP-WCMC 2019) and resolved in communication with data providers. Similar processes apply for the incorporation of data into the <del class="diffmod">World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">WDKBAs</ins> (BirdLife International 2019).</p>
<p>The indicator does not measure the effectiveness of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss, which ultimately depends on a range of management and enforcement factors not covered by the indicator. A number of initiatives are underway to address this limitation. Most notably, numerous mechanisms have been developed for assessment of protected area management, which can be synthesised into an indicator (Leverington et al. 2010). This is used by the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership as a complementary indicator of progress towards Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 </p>
<p>(http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement). However, there may be little relationship between these measures and protected area outcomes (Nolte &amp; Agrawal 2013). More recently, approaches to &#x201C;green listing&#x201D; have started to be developed, to incorporate both management effectiveness and the outcomes of protected areas, and these are likely to become progressively important as they are tested and applied more broadly.</p>
<p>Data and knowledge gaps can arise due to difficulties in determining whether a site conforms to the IUCN definition of a protected area or the CBD definition of an <del class="diffmod">Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures</del><ins class="diffmod">OECM</ins>. However, given that both are incorporated into the indicator, misclassifications (as one or the other) do not impact the calculated indicator value.</p>
<p>Regarding important sites, the biggest limitation is that site identification to date has focused mainly on specific subsets of biodiversity, for example birds (for Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas) and highly threatened species (for Alliance for Zero Extinction sites). While Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas have been documented to be good surrogates for biodiversity more generally (Brooks et al. 2001, Pain et al. 2005), the application of the unified standard for identification of <del class="diffmod">Key</del><ins class="diffmod">KBA</ins> <del class="diffmod">Biodiversity Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">sites</ins> (IUCN 2016)<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;sites</del> across different levels of biodiversity (genes, species, ecosystems) and different taxonomic groups remains a high priority, building from efforts to date (Eken et al. 2004, Knight et al. 2007, Langhammer et al. 2007, Foster et al. 2012). Birds now comprise less than 50% of the species for which <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">KBAs</ins> have been identified, and as <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Area</del><ins class="diffmod">KBA</ins> identification for other taxa and elements of biodiversity proceeds, such bias will become a less important consideration in the future.</p>
<p><del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Area</del><ins class="diffmod">KBA</ins> identification has been validated for a number of countries and regions where comprehensive biodiversity data allow formal calculation of the site importance (or &#x201C;irreplaceability&#x201D;) using systematic conservation planning techniques (Di Marco et al. 2016, Montesino Pouzols et al. 2014).</p>
<p>Future developments of the indicator will include: a) expansion of the taxonomic coverage of marine <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">KBAs</ins> through application of the <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">KBAs</ins> standard (IUCN 2016) to a wide variety of marine vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and ecosystem type; b) improvements in the data on protected areas by continuing to increase the proportion of sites with documented dates of designation and with digitised boundary polygons (rather than coordinates); and c) increased documentation of Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures in the World Database of OECMs.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.c.

Sites were classified as marine <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">KBAs</ins> by undertaking a spatial overlap between the <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Area</del><ins class="diffmod">KBA</ins> polygons and an ocean raster layer (produced from the &#x2018;adm0&#x2019; layer from the database of Global Administrative Areas (GADM 2019)), classifying any <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Area</del><ins class="diffmod">KBA</ins> as a marine <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Area</del><ins class="diffmod">KBA</ins> where it had &#x2265;5% overlap with the ocean layer (hence some sites were classified as both marine and terrestrial). The value of the indicator at a given point in time, based on data on the year of protected area establishment recorded in the <del class="diffmod">World Database on Protected Areas,</del><ins class="diffmod">WDPA</ins> is computed as the mean percentage of each <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Area</del><ins class="diffmod">KBA</ins> currently recognised that is covered by protected areas and/or <del class="diffmod">Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures</del><ins class="diffmod">OECMs</ins>.</p>
<p>Protected areas lacking digital boundaries in the <del class="diffmod">World Database of Protected Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">WDPA</ins>, and those sites with a status of &#x2018;proposed&#x2019; or &#x2018;not reported&#x2019; are omitted. Degazetted sites are not kept in the WDPA and are also not included. Man and Biosphere Reserves are also excluded as these often contain potentially unprotected areas. Year of protected area establishment is unknown for ~12% of protected areas in the <del class="diffmod">World Database on Protected Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">WDPA</ins>, generating uncertainty around changing protected area coverage over time. To reflect this uncertainty, a year was randomly assigned from another protected area within the same country, and then this procedure repeated 1,000 times, with the median plotted. </p>
<p>Prior to 2017, the indicator was presented as the percentage of <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">KBAs</ins> completely covered by protected areas. However, it is now presented as the mean % of each <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Area</del><ins class="diffmod">KBA</ins> that is covered by protected areas in order to better reflect trends in protected area coverage for countries or regions with few or no <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">KBAs</ins> that are completely covered.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.d.

<p>Data on protected areas are submitted by government agencies to the <del class="diffmod">World Database on Protected Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">WDPA</ins> and disseminated through Protected Planet. The WDPA has its origins in a 1959 UN mandate when the United Nations Economic and Social Council called for a list of national parks and equivalent reserves Resolution 713 (XXVIII). <del class="diffmod">More details are available here: https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas. The UN List of Protected Areas has been published in 1961/62, 1966/71, 1972 (addendum to the 1966/71 edition), 1973, 1974, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1985, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2003, 2014 and 2018 which have resulted in a global network of national data providers for the WDPA. For example, in 2014 all Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) National Focal points and all National Focal points for the CBD Protected Areas Programme of Work (PoWPA) to request data for the 2014 Un List of Protected Areas (</del><a href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas-2014"><del class="diffmod">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas-2014</del></a><del class="diffmod">). </del></p><ins class="diffmod">
</ins><p>Protected areas data are therefore compiled directly from government agencies, regional hubs and other authoritative sources in the absence of a government source. All records have a unique metadata identifier (MetadataID) which links the spatial database to the Source table where all sources are described. The data is collated and standardised following the WDPA Data Standards and validated with the source. The process of collation, validation and publication of data as well as protocols and the WDPA data standards are regularly updated in the WDPA User Manual (<a href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual</a>) made available through www.protectedplanet.net where all spatial data and the Source table are also published every month and can be downloaded. The WDPA User Manual (published in English, Spanish, and French) provides guidance to countries on how to submit protected areas data to the WDPA, the benefits of providing such data, and the data standards and quality checks that are performed. </p>

<p>A summary of the process by which <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">KBAs</ins> are identified is available at <a href="http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/working-with-kbas/proposing-updating">www.keybiodiversityareas.org/working-with-kbas/proposing-updating</a>.</p>
<p>The KBA identification process is highly inclusive, consultative and nationally driven. Anyone with appropriate data may propose a site as a KBA, although consultation with relevant stakeholders at the local and national level is required when identifying the site and needs to be documented in the proposal. In order to propose a site as a KBA, a proposer must apply the KBA criteria to data on biodiversity elements (species and ecosystems) at the site. Associated with the proposal process is the need to delineate the site accurately so that its boundaries are clear. Although anyone with appropriate scientific data may propose a site to qualify as a <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Area</del><ins class="diffmod">KBA</ins>, wide consultation with stakeholders at the national level (both non-governmental and governmental organizations) is required during the proposal process. The formal proposal is then made using a proposal process that ensures there is an independent review of the proposal before a site is incorporated in the <del class="diffmod">World Database of KBAs</del><ins class="diffmod">WDKBA</ins>. This is important given that KBA status of a site may lead to changes in actions of governments, private sector companies and other institutions following consultation as appropriate. </p>
<p><del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Area</del><ins class="diffmod">KBA</ins> identification builds off the existing network of <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">KBAs</ins>, including those identified as (a) Important Bird &amp; Biodiversity Areas through the BirdLife Partnership of 120 national organisations (<a href="http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife-partners">http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife-partners</a>), (b) Alliance for Zero Extinction sites by 93 national and international organisations in the Alliance (<a href="http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html">http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html</a>), and (c) other <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">KBAs</ins> by civil society organisations supported by the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund in developing ecosystem profiles, named in each of the profiles listed here (<a href="http://www.cepf.net/resources/publications/Pages/ecosystem_profiles.aspx">http://www.cepf.net/resources/publications/Pages/ecosystem_profiles.aspx</a>), with new data strengthening and expanding expand the network of these sites.</p>
<p>The main steps of the <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Area</del><ins class="diffmod">KBA</ins> identification process are the following: </p>
<ol>
  <li>submission of Expressions of Intent to identify a <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Area</del><ins class="diffmod">KBA</ins> to Regional Focal Points; </li>
  <li>Proposal Development process, in which proposers compile relevant data and documentation and consult national experts, including organizations that have already identified <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">KBAs</ins> in the country, either through national <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Area</del><ins class="diffmod">KBA</ins> Coordination Groups or independently;</li>
  <li>review of proposed <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">KBAs</ins> by Independent Expert Reviewers, verifying the accuracy of information within their area of expertise; and</li>
  <li>a Site Nomination phase comprising the submission of all the relevant documentation for verification by the <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">KBAs</ins> Secretariat. Sites confirmed by the <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">KBAs</ins> Secretariat to qualify as <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">KBAs</ins> are then published on the <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">KBAs</ins> website (<a href="http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Once a <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Area</del><ins class="diffmod">KBA</ins> is identified, monitoring of its qualifying features and its conservation status is important. Proposers, reviewers and those undertaking monitoring can join the <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">KBAs</ins> Community to exchange their experiences, case studies and best practice examples.</p>

<p>This indicator has been classified by the IAEG-SDGs as Tier 1. Current data are available for all countries in the world, and these are updated on an ongoing basis. Index values for each country are available in the UN SDG Indicators Database <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/">https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/</a>. Graphs of Protected area coverage of <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">KBAs</ins> are also available for each country in the BIP Indicators Dashboard (<a href="https://bipdashboard.natureserve.org/bip/SelectCountry.html">https://bipdashboard.natureserve.org/bip/SelectCountry.html</a>), and the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool Country Profiles (<a href="https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles">https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles</a>).</p>
<p>Underlying data on protected areas and Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures are available at <a href="http://www.protectedplanet.net">www.protectedplanet.net</a>. Data on <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">KBAs</ins> are available at <a href="http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org">www.keybiodiversityareas.org</a>. Data on subsets of KBAs are available for Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas at <a href="http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/search">http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/search</a> and for Alliance for Zero Extinction sites at https://zeroextinction.org.</p>
<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>
<p>Given that data for the global indicator are compiled at national levels, it is straightforward to disaggregate to national and regional levels (e.g., Han et al. 2014), or conversely to aggregate to the global level. <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">KBAs</ins> span all ecosystem types through the marine environment (Edgar et al. 2008) and beyond. The indicator can therefore be reported in combination across marine systems along with terrestrial or freshwater systems, or disaggregated among them. However, individual <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">KBAs</ins> can encompass marine, terrestrial, and freshwater systems simultaneously, and so determining the results is not simply additive. </p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">6. Comparability/deviation from international standards (COMPARABILITY)</div></div></div><p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>
<p>National processes provide the data that are incorporated into the <del class="diffmod">World Database on Protected Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">WDPA</ins>, the <del class="diffmod">World Database on Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures</del><ins class="diffmod">WDOECM</ins>, and the World Database of <del class="diffmod">Key Biodiversity Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">KBAs</ins>, so there are very few discrepancies between national indicators and the global one. One minor source of difference is that the <del class="diffmod">World Database on Protected Areas</del><ins class="diffmod">WDPA</ins> incorporates internationally-designated protected areas (e.g., UNESCO World Heritage sites, Ramsar sites, etc), a few of which are not considered by their sovereign nations to be protected areas. </p>
<p>Note that because countries do not submit comprehensive data on degazetted protected areas to the WDPA, earlier values of the indictor may marginally underestimate coverage. Furthermore, there is also a lag between the point at which a protected area is designated on the ground and the point at which it is reported to the WDPA. As such, current or recent coverage may also be underestimated.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">7.
