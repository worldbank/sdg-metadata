<p>The indicator aims to measure the total amount of food that is wasted in tonnes. It complements SDG 12.3.1(a) on Food Loss (which is under the custodianship of FAO). Both indicators look to divide the food value chain and measure the efficiency of the food system. </p>

<p>A full methodology for this indicator is available in the document entitled, &#x201C;Global Chemicals and Waste Indicator Review Document (UNEP, forthcoming)&#x201D;.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Concepts:</ins></strong></p>
<p><em>Food: </em>Any substance&#x2014;whether processed, semi-processed, or raw&#x2014;that is intended for human consumption. &#x201C;Food&#x201D; includes drink and any substance that has been used in the manufacture, preparation, or treatment of food. &#x201C;Food&#x201D; also includes material that has spoiled and is therefore no longer fit for human consumption. It does not include cosmetics, tobacco, or substances used only as drugs. It does not include processing agents used along the food supply chain, for example, water to clean or cook raw materials in factories or at home.</p>
<p><em>Inedible (or non-edible) parts: </em>Components associated with a food that, in a particular food supply chain, are not intended to be consumed by humans. Examples of inedible parts associated with food could include bones, rinds, and pits/stones. &#x201C;Inedible parts&#x201D; do not include packaging. What is considered inedible varies among users (e.g., chicken feet are consumed in some food supply chains but not others), changes over time, and is influenced by a range of variables including culture, socio-economic factors, availability, price, technological advances, international trade, and geography.<em> </em></p>
<p><em>Municipal Solid Waste (MSW)</em> includes waste originating from households, commerce, and trade, small businesses, office buildings and institutions (schools, hospitals, government buildings). It also includes bulky waste (e.g., old furniture, mattresses) and waste from selected municipal services, e.g., waste from park and garden maintenance, waste from street cleaning services (street sweepings, the content of litter containers, market cleansing waste), if managed as waste. Further information on municipal solid waste is defined in the SDG indicator methodology for 11.6.1.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">5. Data availability and disaggregation (COVERAGE)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Data availability:</ins></strong></p>
<p>All countries that reply to the questionnaire. </p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Time series:</ins></strong></p>
<p>The UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire is sent to countries every 2 years requesting annual data.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Disaggregation:</ins></strong></p>
<p>Ideally, food waste would be disaggregated by edible and inedible parts (Note that it is important to take into account the difference between countries in terms of inedible parts. Nicholes et al. provides some insight into differences between countries. </p>
<p>Disaggregation of food waste by destination is important for understanding the best way to optimize the use of food waste for fertilizer. This includes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Co-digestion/anaerobic digestion,</li>
  <li>Composting/aerobic process,</li>
  <li>Controlled combustion,</li>
  <li>Land application,</li>
  <li>Landfill,</li>
  <li>Refuse/discards/litter,</li>
</ul></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">6. Comparability/deviation from international standards (COMPARABILITY)</div></div></div><p><strong><ins class="mod">Sources of discrepancies:</ins></strong></p>
<p>As mentioned, waste statistics involve a large number of national and sub-national stakeholders which may create discrepancies. Additionally, there are a number of challenges related to the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Variations in waste over time can have a significant impact on estimated quantities of waste when short studies (e.g. a week) are used to represent a longer time period (a year)</li>
  <li>The specific time of year when a study takes place which may affect the waste produced;</li>
  <li>Natural variation over time in amounts of waste generated by single entities (e.g. households or restaurants). </li>
  <li>At a national level, countries may have to rely on other entities to measure their own waste and report to the government, which would then be collated and analysed to estimate the total amount. How the data is collected would vary by the food chain stage as the way food waste is generated in each stage varies. For example, a large formal retailer (supermarket chain) may keep records of stock unsold and discarded which could be reported. On the other hand, a government requesting reporting from households may have to issue guidance to local municipalities and prescribe a quantification method e.g. a food waste diary. The reported quantities may require scaling if a government cannot obtain reports from the entire population of the food chain stage i.e. it is unlikely that every household in the country would report.</li>
