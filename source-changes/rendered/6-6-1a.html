<p>Indicator 6.6.1 tracks the extent to which different types of water-related ecosystems are changing in extent over time. The indicator is multifaceted capturing data on different types of freshwater ecosystems and to measure extent change the indicator considers spatial area changes, water quality and water quantity changes. The indicator uses satellite based Earth observations to globally monitor different freshwater ecosystems types Earth observation data series on surface area are available on permanent water, seasonal water, reservoirs, wetlands, mangroves; as well as generating data on water quality the using trophic state and turbidity of water bodies. Satellite images can be represented as numerical data, which in turn are aggregated into meaningful statistics of ecosystem change attributed to administrative areas such as national, sub-national (e.g. regions and provinces) and river basin boundaries. Global data products for river flows and groundwater level have not yet been produced at useful spatial and temporal resolutions to be incorporated into this SDG 6.6.1 methodology. Currently, these data should continue to be provided from modelling or from ground-based measurements and required from the countries.</p>

<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p>The concepts and definitions used in the methodology have been based on existing international frameworks and glossaries unless where indicated otherwise below.</p>
<p><strong>Water-related ecosystems</strong> are a sub-set of all ecosystems. They contain the world&#x2019;s freshwater resources and can be defined as &#x201C;a dynamic complex of plant, animal, and micro-organism communities and the non-living environment dominated by the presence of flowing or still water, interacting as a functional unit.&#x201D; (MEA, 2005; Dickens et al, 2019). The indicator is framed around the monitoring of different types of water-related ecosystems including lakes, rivers, wetlands, groundwater and artificial waterbodies such as reservoirs. These water-related ecosystems contain freshwater, with the exception of mangroves which contain brackish water (i.e. a combination of fresh and saltwater) however mangroves are still included within indicator 6.6.1. Reservoirs are also included as a category of water-related ecosystem within the indicator methodology; while it is recognized that reservoirs are not traditional water ecosystems which should necessarily warrant protection and restoration, in many countries they hold a noteworthy amount of freshwater and have thus been included. By including data on reservoirs, it is intended that countries can better understand changes occurring to artificial water bodies in conjunction with changes occurring to natural water bodies. Ecosystems that are not included under indicator 6.6.1 are: coral reefs and sea grass which are covered within Goal 14 (Oceans); and mountains, forests, and drylands which are covered within Goal 15 (Land). The extent to which each of the water-related ecosystems included under indicator 6.6.1 can be measured, uses one or more of the following physical parameters of change: spatial area, quantity (or volume) of water, and water quality. The full monitoring methodology for indicator 6.6.1 is available here. The extent to which each of the water-related ecosystems included under indicator 6.6.1 can be measured, uses one or more of the following physical parameters of change: spatial area, quantity (or volume) of water, and water quality.</p>
<p><strong>Inland vegetated wetlands</strong> include areas of marshes, peatlands, swamps, bogs and fens, the vegetated parts of floodplains as well as rice paddies and flood recession agriculture. Inland vegetated wetlands do not include coastal mangroves. Data on mangroves which are produced separately to inland wetlands. This SDG indicator methodology is used for official reporting of SDG indicator 6.6.1 statistics. The SDG indicator 6.6.1 methodology does not apply the definition of wetlands defined by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, which is: &#x201C;areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six meters&#x201D;. The Ramsar definition of wetlands may be interpreted to mean all water within a country including the marine environment. The SDG indicator 6.6.1 definition refers to only a specific group of inland vegetated wetlands typologies.</p>
<p><ins class="mod">Permanent and seasonal water</ins>. A permanent water surface is underwater throughout the year whilst a seasonal water surface is underwater for less than 12 months of the year. Some locations don&#x2019;t have observations for all 12 months of the year (for reasons such as polar night). In these cases, water is considered as seasonal if the number of months where water is present is less than the number of months where valid observations were acquired.</p>
<p>A second consideration is lakes and rivers that freeze for part of the year. During the frozen period water is still present under the ice (true both for rivers/lakes and the sea). If water is present throughout the observation period (i.e. unfrozen period), the water body is considered as a permanent water surface. If the area of the water body contracts during the unfrozen period, then the pixels along the borders of the lake or river are no longer water, and those pixels will be considered as a seasonal water surface.</p>
<p><strong>Reservoirs</strong> are artificial (or human-made) bodies of freshwater, as opposed to lakes which are naturally occurring. The reservoirs dataset represents surface area data on artificial water bodies including reservoirs formed by dams, flooded areas such as opencast mines and quarries, flood irrigation areas, and water bodies created by hydro-engineering projects such as waterway and harbour construction.</p>
<p><strong>Turbidity</strong> is an indicator of water clarity, quantifying the haziness of the water and acting as an indicator of underwater light availability.</p>
<p><strong>Trophic State</strong> refers to the degree at which organic matter accumulates in the water body and is most commonly used in relation to monitoring eutrophication.</p>
<p>Surface Water refers to any area of surface water unobstructed by aquatic vegetation. This includes the following 3 water-related ecosystem categories: rivers and estuaries, lakes, and artificial waterbodies.</p>
<p>Extent &#x2013; has been expanded beyond spatial extent to capture additional basic parameters needed for the protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems. Extent includes three components: the spatial extent or surface area, the quality, and the quantity of water-related ecosystems. </p>
<p>Change means a shift from one condition of extent to another over time within a water-related ecosystem, measured against a point of reference.</p>
<p><strong>Permanent and seasonal water concept definitions and data resolution</strong></p>
<p>Data on the spatial and temporal dynamics of naturally occurring surface water has been generated for the entire globe. A Global Surface Water dataset (Pekel et al., 2016) has been produced by the European Commission&apos;s Joint Research Centre. The dataset documents different facets of the long term (since 1984 onward) water dynamics at 30x30 meter pixel resolution. The dataset documents permanent and seasonal surface water surfaces. All naturally occurring surface water larger in area than 30x30 meters has been mapped and at this 30 meter grid/pixel spatial resolution satellite imagery is predominantly capturing areas of lakes and wide rivers (ie rivers over 30meters wide). The data include land areas that are temporarily inundated. Smaller rivers and waterbodies are not captured as they are too narrow to detect or are masked by forest canopy. The data include individual full-resolution images acquired by the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 and Sentinel 1 satellites. These satellites capture images which are distributed publicly by the United States Geological Survey and by the European Union&#x2019;s Copernicus space programme. Together they provide multispectral imagery at 30x30 meter resolution in six visible, near and shortwave infrared channels, plus thermal imagery at 60x60 meters. </p>
<p>The data includes land surfaces that are under water (e.g. a permanent water area) for all twelve months of a year. It also accounts for seasonal and climactic fluctuations of water, meaning lakes and rivers which freeze for part of the year are captured. Areas of permanent ice, such as glaciers and ice caps as well as permanently snow-covered land areas are not included. Areas of consistent cloud cover inhibit the observation of water surfaces in some areas and in these limited locations optical observations may not be available. A global shoreline mask has been applied to the data to prevent ocean water being included in the freshwater statistics and the methodology for this shoreline mask is published in the journal of operational oceanography, available here (Sayer et al. 2019).</p>
<p>The accuracy of the Global Surface Water map was determined using over 40,000 control points from around the world and across the 36 years. The full validation methodology and results have been published in the scientific journal Nature, available here, (Pekel et al., 2016). The validation results show that the water detection expert system produced less than 1% of false water detections, and that less than 5% of water surfaces were missed. The provided maps are derived from the analysis of over four million images collected over 36 years which have been individually processed using an accurate expert system classifier.</p>
<p>The SDG 6.6.1 data portal (www.sdg661.app) documents various water transitions relating to permanent and seasonal surface water - these are changes in water state between two points in time (e.g. 2000 - 2019). Data is available for various transitions including new permanent water surfaces (i.e. conversion of a no water place into a permanent water place.); lost permanent water surfaces (i.e. conversion of a permanent water place into a no water place) as well as new and lost seasonal water. These allow monthly water presence or absence data to be captured. It is possible to identify specific months/years in which conditions changed, e.g. the date of filing of a new dam, or the month/year in which a lake disappeared. In addition, data on seasonality are provided, capturing changes resulting from intra and inter-annual variability or resulting from appearance or disappearance of seasonal or permanent water surfaces. The data separates &apos;permanent&apos; water bodies (those that are present throughout the period of observation) [nominally a year] from &apos;seasonal&apos; (those that are present for only part of the year).</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">3.a. Data sources (SOURCE_TYPE)</div></div></div><p>Surface water area data, acquired by the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellites at a 30 m resolution, has been generated for the entire globe from 2000-2019. From 2016 onwards (up to and including 2030), higher spatial and temporal resolution satellites, including both optical and radar satellites, are used.). Additional datasets are used refine open water spatial area data, including the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) geospatial database. To generate spatial area of vegetated wetlands, a combination of imagery from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 1 and 2 are used Global Mangrove Watch data is derived from JAXA ALOS satellites and Landsat to generate mangrove extent. Water quality is derived from MERIS and European Sentinel satellites.</p>
<p>Lake water trophic state and TSS lake observations are obtained from combined Landsat and Sentinel satellites paired with instruments like OLCI, MODIS, and VIIRS. The sensor instruments used to detect TSS and trophic state determine the spatial resolution of water quality within lakes which can be detected. Some of the more accurate water quality sensors have 250-350 meter resolution, while less accurate sensors can detect TSS and trophic state changes to 100 m resolution. </p>
<p>The source of data for monitoring stream flow and groundwater quantity is from national in situ measurements of groundwater level within aquifers and stream flow quantity. However globally derived hydrological run off modelled data will soon be available and used to measure stream flow as part of indicator 661 replacing the need for In-situ stream flow measurements to be collected.<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;</ins></p>

Globally derived data using spatial area measurements are computed in a comparable and consistent manner across the different ecosystem types e.g. surface water, wetland, mangroves. Globally derived data on water quality is computed using the parameters of turbidity and trophic state to infer a measure of water quality. National data on quantity of water in ecosystems is used to measure stream flow and groundwater volumes.

<p>In developing the methodology for indicator 6.6.1 UNEP set up a technical expert group . This group provided inputs into the development of the monitoring methodology. A first draft (Tier III) methodology was piloted in 2017 and sent to all UN Member States accompanied with relevant capacity support materials. A limited number of Member States (19 per cent) submitted data to UNEP after a period of 8 months. The data that was received was of poor quality and coverage. Countries cited a lack of data to report, and neither time nor resources to initiate new ecosystem monitoring.</p>
<p>Following on from the global piloting and testing phase, and to address a known global data gap for the indicator, the methodology was revised to incorporate data on water-related ecosystem derived from satellite-based Earth observations. UNEP engaged with a series of partners working with global data products considered relevant and suitable for the indicator. The assessment of global data sources considered data quality, resolution, frequency of measurements, global coverage, time series, and scalability (i.e. disaggregated data at national and sub-national levels). The result was a methodology that is statistically robust producing internationally comparable data without being too onerous for countries to report on. The technical expert group was consulted on the updated methodology before submission to the IAEG-SDG for approval. </p>
<p>At the 7th IAEG-SDG meeting in April 2018 the indicator methodology was approved and classified as Tier II. Shortly afterwards, in November 2018, it was reclassified to a Tier I indicator methodology. The Tier I classification means that the indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, and data are regularly produced by at least 50 per cent of countries and of the population in every region where the indicator is relevant.</p>
<p>Throughout 2019 UNEP continued to work with its partners to improve the globally available datasets relevant to SDG indicator 6.6.1 and the measurement of changes occurring to different types of water-related ecosystem. As such, this methodology was updated in March 2020 to include more detailed information about the approach used to obtain satellite-based Earth observation data with regard to the sub-indicators.</p>
