<p>Indicator 5.a.2 <del class="diffmod">looks at</del><ins class="diffmod">assesses</ins> the extent to which the <ins class="diffins">national </ins>legal <del class="diffmod">framework</del><ins class="diffmod">frameworks</ins> (including customary law) <del class="diffmod">guarantees</del><ins class="diffmod">guarantee</ins> women&#x2019;s equal rights to land ownership and/or control. </p>
<p>The indicator &#x201C;measures&#x201D; the level to which a country&#x2019;s legal framework supports women&#x2019;s land rights, by testing that framework against six proxies drawn from international law and internationally accepted good practices , in particular the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) ratified by 189 countries, and the Voluntary Guidelines for the Responsible Governance of the Tenure of Land Fisheries and Forestry (VGGT) endorsed unanimously by Committee of Food Security (CFS) members in 2012.</p>
<p>The six proxies through which indicator 5.a.2 is monitored are the following:</p>
<p>Proxy A: Joint registration of land <ins class="diffins">is </ins>compulsory or encouraged through economic incentives</p>
<p>Proxy B: Compulsory spousal consent for land transactions</p>
<p>Proxy C: Women&#x2019;s and girls&#x2019; equal inheritance rights</p>
<p>Proxy D: Allocation of financial resources to increase women&#x2019;s ownership and control over land</p>
<p>Proxy E: In legal systems that <del class="diffmod">recognise</del><ins class="diffmod">recognize</ins> customary land tenure,<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;the</ins> existence of explicit protection of the land rights of women</p>
<p>Proxy F: Mandatory quotas for women&#x2019;s participation in land management and administration institutions</p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p>The indicator tracks progress on legal reforms that guarantee women&#x2019;s land rights (including customary<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;law</ins>) in terms of ownership and/or control. </p>
<p>The <del class="diffdel">indicator refers to customary law. The inclusion of the </del>customary dimension <del class="diffmod">in</del><ins class="diffmod">of</ins> the indicator is very important because in many contexts in which <del class="diffmod">these</del><ins class="diffmod">customary</ins> <del class="diffmod">systems</del><ins class="diffmod">law</ins> <del class="diffmod">prevail</del><ins class="diffmod">prevails</ins>, women&#x2019;s land rights tend to be denied or insecure. However, the enormous diversity of customs and social norms that govern customary land among <ins class="diffins">and within </ins>countries and their unwritten nature, create a significant challenge for assessing whether the proxies are present in these systems. <del class="diffmod">To solve this issue</del><ins class="diffmod">Therefore</ins>,<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;it is proposed that</del> the customary dimension will <ins class="diffins">only </ins>be considered <del class="diffmod">only when</del><ins class="diffmod">in</ins> the <del class="diffmod">formal</del><ins class="diffmod">case it has been incorporated the</ins> legal <del class="diffmod">framework recognizes customary land tenure</del><ins class="diffmod">system</ins>. </p>
<p>Finally, the indicator refers to ownership and/or control of land which are two critical but different dimensions <del class="diffmod">regarding</del><ins class="diffmod">of</ins> women&#x2019;s land rights. Land ownership refers to the legally <del class="diffmod">recognised</del><ins class="diffmod">recognized</ins> right to acquire, <del class="diffdel">to </del>use and <del class="diffdel">to </del>transfer <del class="diffmod">landed</del><ins class="diffmod">land</ins> property, while<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;the</del> control over land is associated with the ability to make decisions over land.</p>
<p>Key definitions are the following:</p>
<p><em><ins class="mod">Land</ins></em></p>
<p>Land is defined as all immovable property &#x2013; for instance the house, the land upon which a house is built and land which is used for other purposes, such as agricultural production. It also encompasses any other structures built on land to meet permanent purposes. Legal frameworks commonly use the terms &#x2018;immovable property&#x2019; or &#x2018;real property&#x2019; when referring to land.</p>
<p><em><ins class="mod">Land ownership</ins></em></p>
<p>Land ownership is a legally <del class="diffmod">recognised</del><ins class="diffmod">recognized</ins> right to acquire, <del class="diffdel">to </del>use and<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;to</del> transfer land. In private property systems, this is a right akin to<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;a</del> freehold tenure. In systems where land is owned by the state, the term <ins class="diffins">&#x201C;</ins>land ownership<ins class="diffins">&#x201D;</ins> refers to possession of the rights most akin to ownership in a private property system &#x2013; for instance, long-term leases, occupancy, tenancy or use rights granted by the state that are transferrable and are granted to users for several decades (for instance 99 years).</p>
<p><em><ins class="mod">Control over land</ins></em></p>
<p>Control over land is the ability to make decisions over land. It may include rights to make decisions about how the land should be used, including what crops should be planted, and to benefit financially from the sale of crops<del class="diffdel">, including what crops should be planted, and to benefit financially from the sale of crops</del>. </p>
<p><em><ins class="mod">Customary land tenure</ins></em></p>
<p>Customary land tenure is defined as the bodies of rules and institutions governing the way land and natural resources are held, managed, used and transacted within customary legal systems.</p>
<p><em><ins class="mod">Customary legal systems</ins></em></p>
<p>Customary legal systems are systems that exist at the local or community level, that have not been set up by the state, and that derive their legitimacy from the values and traditions of the indigenous or local group. Customary legal systems may or may not be recognized by national law. </p>
<p><em><ins class="mod">Legal and policy framework</ins></em></p>
<p>The legal and policy framework <del class="diffmod">encompasses</del><ins class="diffmod">comprises</ins> <del class="diffmod">the</del><ins class="diffmod">a</ins> <del class="diffmod">Constitution,</del><ins class="diffmod">set</ins> <del class="diffmod">policy,</del><ins class="diffmod">of</ins> <del class="diffmod">primary</del><ins class="diffmod">publicly</ins> <del class="diffmod">legislation and secondary legislation. The</del><ins class="diffmod">available</ins> legal and policy <del class="diffmod">framework</del><ins class="diffmod">instruments governing land and family matters in force when conducting the assessment, including the Constitution, primary - and secondary legislation and policies. It</ins> includes customary legal systems where they have been <del class="diffmod">recognised</del><ins class="diffmod">recognized</ins> by statutory law.</p>
<p><ins class="diffins">&nbsp;</ins></p><ins class="diffins">
</ins><p><em>Personal laws </em></p>
<p>Personal law is defined as a set of codified rules and norms applying to a group of people sharing a common religious faith <del class="diffmod">with regard to</del><ins class="diffmod">about</ins> personal matters. These laws usually cover family relations, marriage, and inheritance. The term can be used interchangeably with &#x2018;religious laws&#x2019;.</p>
<p><em><ins class="mod">Primary legislation </ins></em></p>
<p>Primary legislation refers to (i) acts or statutes that have been formally adopted at<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;the</ins> national level following the official parliamentary procedure for the passage of laws (in parliamentary systems); (ii) other acts at the national level with the force of law, such as decree-laws and legislative decrees and otherwise (in parliamentary systems); (iii) other legal instruments<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;that have</del> that have been formally endorsed by a law-making body, for instance presidential and royal orders or presidential and royal decrees (in non-parliamentary systems or systems where law-making power lies in an additional institution to the parliament). In all cases, primary legislation must have the force of law, be binding. For <del class="diffdel">the purposes of </del>this assessment primary legislation<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;also</del> includes the Constitution. </p>
<p><em><ins class="mod">Secondary legislation</ins></em></p>
<p>Secondary legislation includes subsidiary, delegated or subordinate legal instruments that have the force of law, are binding<ins class="diffins">,</ins> and shall not be in contradiction with primary legislation. They are usually passed by the executive, such as national regulations, rules, by-laws, determinations, directions, circulars, orders, and implementing decrees.</p>
<p><em><ins class="mod">Joint registration</ins></em></p>
<p>Joint registration is where the names of both spouses or both partners in an unmarried couple, are entered into the land registry as the owners or principal users of the land being registered. Joint registration signifies a form of shared tenure over the land &#x2013; usually either a joint tenancy/occupancy or a tenancy in common). In legal systems which include a framework for land titling, joint registration is commonly referred to as joint titling.<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;</ins></p>
<p><em><ins class="mod">Unmarried couples</ins></em></p>
<p>Unmarried couples are defined as couples who live together (cohabit) in an intimate relationship, but who are not married <del class="diffmod">in accordance with</del><ins class="diffmod">following</ins> the marriage law of the country. <del class="diffmod">Often</del><ins class="diffmod">It</ins> <del class="diffmod">this will refer</del><ins class="diffmod">refers</ins> to couples who were married under custom or religious laws, where such marriages are not <del class="diffmod">recognised</del><ins class="diffmod">recognized</ins> or do not comply with the requirements of the formal law. It may also refer to relationships that are <del class="diffmod">recognised</del><ins class="diffmod">recognized</ins> by the state but that are not considered a marriage &#x2013; for instance a civil partnership and a de facto relationship that is registered with the state. The term &#x2018;unmarried couples&#x2019; is often used interchangeably with &#x2018;de facto unions&#x2019;, &#x2018;consensual unions&#x2019; or &#x2018;irregular unions&#x2019;. The members of an unmarried couple are referred to as &#x2018;partners&#x2019;.</p>
<p><em><ins class="mod">Land transactions</ins></em></p>
<p>Land transactions for<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;the purpose of</del> the methodology are major land transactions, specifically the sale and encumbrance (mortgage) of land. </p>
<p><em><ins class="mod">Inheritance</ins></em></p>
<p>Inheritance is defined as property passing at the owner&apos;s death to the heir or those entitled to succeed.</p>
<p><em><ins class="mod">Deceased&#x2019;s estate</ins></em></p>
<p>The deceased&#x2019;s estate encompasses the legal rights, interests and entitlements, to property of any kind (not only land) which the deceased spouse or partner enjoyed at the time of death, less any liabilities. Depending on the legal system, marital property may be excluded fully from the calculation of deceased&#x2019;s estate, or<del class="diffdel">,</del> the deceased&#x2019;s 50% share in the marital property will be included. </p>
<p><em><ins class="mod">Equal inheritance rights for sons and daughters</ins></em></p>
<p>Equal inheritance rights for sons and daughters <del class="diffmod">refer</del><ins class="diffmod">require the law on intestate inheritance</ins> to <del class="diffmod">the</del><ins class="diffmod">either</ins> <del class="diffmod">situation</del><ins class="diffmod">be</ins> <del class="diffmod">when</del><ins class="diffmod">gender-neutral</ins> <del class="diffmod">the</del><ins class="diffmod">or</ins> <del class="diffmod">lines</del><ins class="diffmod">provide</ins> <del class="diffmod">of</del><ins class="diffmod">for</ins> <del class="diffmod">succession</del><ins class="diffmod">both an equal rank and equal shares</ins> in the <del class="diffdel">legal and policy framework governing </del>inheritance <del class="diffmod">states equality of rank and shares between</del><ins class="diffmod">for</ins> brothers and sisters <ins class="diffins">(</ins>or<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;between</del> daughters and sons<del class="diffmod">, or are gender neutral</del><ins class="diffmod">)</ins>.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">2.b.

The only exception to this rule is Proxy D where also national <del class="diffmod">wide</del><ins class="diffmod">land/agrarian reform or titling</ins> programs are considered for the purpose of the assessment. However, for the meaningfulness of the assessment, relevant policies are considered for the analysis<ins class="diffins">, but recorded only in the additional information section,</ins> because they represent the foundations of the law setting out the principles that indicate the direction towards which the country aims to move and very often suggest reforms that need to be adopted in the legal framework. In this sense, if the proxies are present in these types of instruments they constitute an important step towards a more gender sensitive legal framework.</p>
<p>The data are extracted directly from the laws in force <del class="diffdel">at the moment </del>when the assessment is carried out.

<p>To complete the indicator 5.a.2 assessment, national legal experts must examine the national legal and policy framework and complete the electronic questionnaire following the methodological guidelines. This involves three steps that must be repeated for each proxy. </p>
<p>1. Collect all the relevant policy and legal documents, using the checklist contained in the <del class="diffdel">electronic </del>questionnaire as a guide<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;as to the instruments to check for the concerned proxy</del>.</p>
<p>2. Using the detailed methodological guidelines, determine whether the proxy exists in the legal and policy framework and in which instruments. </p>
<p>3. Complete the questionnaire for each proxy, citing the instrument and the relevant provisions where the proxy was located <del class="diffmod">as</del><ins class="diffmod">in</ins> <del class="diffmod">well</del><ins class="diffmod">Form</ins> <del class="diffmod">as</del><ins class="diffmod">1, and</ins> any<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;further</del> relevant information or exception<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;directly associated with the proxy in the additional information box (Form 2) such as policies and/or adopted bills</ins>. Include a hyperlink to the text of the legal and policy instrument. </p>
<p>After these three steps have been undertaken for all six proxies the <ins class="diffins">responsible </ins>national<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;responsible</del> institution will identify the level of protection to women&#x2019;s land rights present in the legal framework according to the number of proxies located. </p>

<p>The focus on land of Indicator 5.a.2 reflects the recognition that land is a key economic resource inextricably linked to access to, use of and control over other economic and productive resources. It is a key input for agricultural production; it can <del class="diffmod">be</del><ins class="diffmod">facilitate</ins> <del class="diffmod">used as collateral</del><ins class="diffmod">access</ins> to <del class="diffdel">access </del>financial <del class="diffmod">resources,</del><ins class="diffmod">and</ins> extension services or to join producer organisations<del class="diffmod">;</del><ins class="diffmod">.</ins> <del class="diffmod">and</del><ins class="diffmod">Moreover</ins>, it can generate income directly<del class="diffdel">,</del> if rented or sold. It also acknowledges that women&#x2019;s ownership of and/or control of land is critical for poverty reduction, food security, inclusiveness and overall sustainable development objectives. Finally, gender equality in land ownership and control is a human right. For example, <del class="diffdel">Article 3 of </del>the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) guarantees equality between women and men, and prohibits discrimination based on sex in Article 2. Article 26 of the <del class="diffmod">treaty</del><ins class="diffmod">ICCPR</ins> enshrines equality before the law<del class="diffdel">,</del> and can be applied to defend women&#x2019;s right to non-discrimination and equality, <del class="diffmod">not only with respect to civil and political rights, but also with</del><ins class="diffmod">including</ins> economic and social rights. Further, the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), emphasizes that discrimination against women &#x201C;violates the principles of equality of rights and respect for human dignity&quot;.</p>
<p>The following paragraphs describe the scope and rationale of the proxies, as well as <del class="diffmod">its</del><ins class="diffmod">their</ins> specific content. </p>
<p>For guidance on the meaning of the terms used in the proxies please refer to the terminology in section 2.a &#x201C;Definitions and concepts&#x201D; of this document. For detailed information on the conditions determining whether the proxy exists in the legal <del class="diffdel">and policy </del>framework please refer to the methodological guidelines &#x201C;Realizing women&#x2019;s rights to land in the law. A Guide for reporting on SDG Indicator 5.a.2&#x201D;.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Proxy A:</ins></strong> Is the joint registration of land compulsory or encouraged through economic incentives?</p>
<p>Without the inclusion of their names on the land title, deed or certificate, women&#x2019;s property rights remain insecure, especially in the context of land registration programs and <del class="diffdel">of </del>property acquired by the spouses during the marriage. This is particularly the case for married women who separate, divorce, are abandoned<ins class="diffins">,</ins> or become widows.</p>
<p>The proxy therefore assesses whether the legal and policy framework <del class="diffmod">include</del><ins class="diffmod">includes</ins> provisions requiring joint registration of land or encouraging joint registration through economic incentives for both married and unmarried couples. For the proxy to be present it is sufficient that joint registration is provided at least for married couples.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Proxy B:</ins></strong> Does the legal and policy framework require spousal consent for land transactions?</p>
<p><del class="diffmod">Whenever actions are taken unilaterally by a husband or male partner regarding</del><ins class="diffmod">Major</ins> land <del class="diffdel">related </del>transactions<ins class="diffins">,</ins> such<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;as the</ins> sale, mortgage or lease<del class="diffdel">,</del> <del class="diffmod">especially</del><ins class="diffmod">of</ins> <del class="diffmod">when</del><ins class="diffmod">family</ins> <del class="diffmod">they</del><ins class="diffmod">land</ins> <del class="diffmod">concern</del><ins class="diffmod">or</ins> the family home<ins class="diffins">,</ins> <del class="diffmod">or</del><ins class="diffmod">can</ins> <del class="diffmod">other</del><ins class="diffmod">directly</ins> <del class="diffmod">critical</del><ins class="diffmod">affect</ins> <del class="diffmod">assets,</del><ins class="diffmod">women&#x2019;s land rights if</ins> they <del class="diffmod">can</del><ins class="diffmod">do</ins> <del class="diffmod">leave</del><ins class="diffmod">not</ins> <del class="diffmod">women</del><ins class="diffmod">participate</ins> <del class="diffmod">and</del><ins class="diffmod">in</ins> <del class="diffmod">any</del><ins class="diffmod">the</ins> <del class="diffmod">children homeless and without means of subsistence</del><ins class="diffmod">decisions</ins>. Therefore, spousal or partner consent requirements <del class="diffmod">prior</del><ins class="diffmod">for</ins> <del class="diffmod">to any land</del><ins class="diffmod">such</ins> transaction strengthen women&#x2019;s control rights over land <del class="diffmod">whether</del><ins class="diffmod">by</ins> <del class="diffmod">they</del><ins class="diffmod">protecting</ins> <del class="diffmod">are</del><ins class="diffmod">them</ins> <del class="diffmod">married</del><ins class="diffmod">against unilateral actions taken by their husband</ins> or<ins class="diffins">,</ins> <del class="diffmod">within</del><ins class="diffmod">in</ins> <del class="diffmod">an</del><ins class="diffmod">the case of</ins> unmarried <del class="diffmod">couple</del><ins class="diffmod">couples, partner</ins>. <del class="diffmod">By</del><ins class="diffmod">Provisions</ins> <del class="diffmod">supporting</del><ins class="diffmod">that support</ins> equality in <del class="diffmod">the</del><ins class="diffmod">marriage</ins> <del class="diffmod">marriage</del><ins class="diffmod">relations</ins> and <del class="diffmod">the</del><ins class="diffmod">that provide for</ins> joint administration of <del class="diffmod">important</del><ins class="diffmod">matrimonial</ins> property<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;including land</ins>,<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;such provisions</del> directly contribute<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;to the achievement of indicator 5.a.2, particularly with regard</del> to gender equality in the control over land. </p>
<p>The proxy examines whether <del class="diffmod">countries</del><ins class="diffmod">national</ins> <del class="diffmod">incorporate</del><ins class="diffmod">laws</ins> <del class="diffmod">into</del><ins class="diffmod">provide</ins> <del class="diffmod">the</del><ins class="diffmod">for</ins> <del class="diffmod">legal and policy framework a</del><ins class="diffmod">mandatory</ins> spouse or partner consent for land transactions. As with proxy A, the assessment covers both married and unmarried couples. Yet, for proxy B to be present it is sufficient that spousal consent is provided at least for married couples.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Proxy C:</ins></strong> Does the legal and policy framework support women&#x2019;s and girls&#x2019; equal inheritance rights?</p>
<p>Inheritance is one of the main channels through which women acquire property and secure independent land rights. However, the persistence of discriminatory cultural and legal norms often denies women&#x2019;s and girls&#x2019; equal inheritance rights and <del class="diffmod">hinder</del><ins class="diffmod">hinders</ins> women&#x2019;s opportunity to acquire property on an equal footing to men. Personal laws and customary laws<ins class="diffins">,</ins> in particular<del class="diffmod">&nbsp;have</del><ins class="diffmod">,</ins> often <del class="diffmod">denied</del><ins class="diffmod">deny</ins> women&#x2019;s right to inherit or <del class="diffdel">at least </del>to inherit <ins class="diffins">in </ins>equal shares<ins class="diffins">. However</ins>,<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;and</del> many post-colonial governments have incorporated these rules in the formal legal architecture. In some cases, daughters may only be entitled to inherit in the absence of a traceable male relative. </p>
<p>Proxy C examines the extent to which <del class="diffmod">states</del><ins class="diffmod">national</ins> <del class="diffmod">have</del><ins class="diffmod">laws</ins> <del class="diffmod">incorporated</del><ins class="diffmod">on</ins> <del class="diffmod">into</del><ins class="diffmod">intestate</ins> <del class="diffmod">their</del><ins class="diffmod">inheritance</ins> <del class="diffmod">legal and policy framework provisions that guarantee</del><ins class="diffmod">establish</ins> equal inheritance rights <del class="diffmod">over land to</del><ins class="diffmod">for</ins> surviving children and <ins class="diffins">the </ins>surviving <del class="diffmod">spouses</del><ins class="diffmod">spouse(s) regardless of sex</ins>.</p>
<p>This proxy aims to identify if the legal and policy framework of a country<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;provides that</ins>: </p>
<p>1. <del class="diffmod">Provide that sons</del><ins class="diffmod">Sons</ins> and daughters have equal inheritance rights and equal shares; and</p>
<p>2. <del class="diffmod">Provide that male</del><ins class="diffmod">Male</ins> and female surviving spouse and/or partner are entitled to an equal right of the deceased spouse&#x2019;s estate and/or to a lifetime user right to the family home.</p>
<p><del class="diffmod">Both</del><ins class="diffmod">The law must prescribe both</ins> equal inheritance rights for sons and daughters and <ins class="diffins">for the </ins>surviving spouse and/or partner<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;have to be ensured</del> for Proxy to be present.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Proxy D:</ins></strong> Does the legal and policy framework provide for the allocation of financial resources to increase women&#x2019;s ownership and control over land?</p>
<p>Legal reforms to support gender equality in land ownership and/or control and access to other productive resources have not always translated into practice. The poor implementation of land and agriculture related policies and laws geared towards enhancing gender equality, is partially due to the lack or insufficiency of financial resources. </p>
<p>For this reason, this proxy identifies any legal provision that commits the government to allocate financial resources <del class="diffmod">for</del><ins class="diffmod">to</ins> <del class="diffmod">the purpose of increasing</del><ins class="diffmod">increase</ins> women&#x2019;s ownership and control over land or access to productive resources, including land. Such provisions are widely regarded as innovative measures to support women&#x2019;s land rights<del class="diffdel">,</del> and have been consistently endorsed by the CEDAW Committee in its deliberations and comments on state parties&#x2019; reports under the treaty. <del class="diffmod">The &#x201C;condition sine qua non&#x201D; for</del><ins class="diffmod">For</ins> this proxy to be <del class="diffmod">satisfied that</del><ins class="diffmod">present,</ins> the fund <del class="diffmod">is</del><ins class="diffmod">must be</ins> anchored into <del class="diffmod">the</del><ins class="diffmod">a</ins> national law <del class="diffmod">and</del><ins class="diffmod">that</ins> explicitly mentions the purpose of improving women&#x2019;s land rights.</p>
<p>Since Proxy D amounts to a &#x201C;special measure&#x201D;, as per Art. 4 of CEDAW, countries that do not include this measure in their legal <del class="diffdel">and policy </del>framework, <del class="diffmod">yet</del><ins class="diffmod">may</ins> provide official national statistical data showing the achievement of at least 40 percent of women&#x2019;s ownership and/or control over land (e.g. data on SDG 5.a.1, or 1.4.2.)<del class="diffdel">,</del> <del class="diffmod">will equally</del><ins class="diffmod">to</ins> satisfy the proxy.</p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Proxy E</ins></strong>: In legal systems that <del class="diffmod">recognise</del><ins class="diffmod">recognize</ins> customary land tenure, does the legal and policy framework explicitly protect the land rights of women?</p>
<p>Many countries have incorporated customary land tenure rights into the formal legal system, in effect &#x2018;formalizing&#x2019; them. The legal recognition of customary land tenure however may reinforce discriminatory practices where there is no explicit protection for women&#x2019;s customary land rights. Further, the use of gender<del class="diffmod">&nbsp;</del><ins class="diffmod">-</ins>neutral provisions in the context of <del class="diffmod">formalisation</del><ins class="diffmod">formalization</ins> of customary land tenure has in practice been associated with a lack of protection of women&#x2019;s rights. To avoid such outcomes explicit provisions <del class="diffmod">securing the protection of</del><ins class="diffmod">protecting</ins> the land rights of women should accompany <del class="diffdel">any </del>legal <del class="diffmod">provision</del><ins class="diffmod">provisions</ins> recognizing customary land rights. </p>
<p>Proxy E assesses whether the Constitution and/or any land related law that <del class="diffmod">recognises</del><ins class="diffmod">recognizes</ins> customary land tenure<ins class="diffins">,</ins> <del class="diffmod">provides</del><ins class="diffmod">explicitly</ins> <del class="diffmod">explicit</del><ins class="diffmod">protect</ins> <del class="diffmod">protections for</del><ins class="diffmod">s</ins> women&#x2019;s land rights. </p>
<p>It is important to note that for those countries where customary law has not been incorporated into the legal framework, Proxy E is not applicable and will not be assessed in the computation. As noted above, the <del class="diffdel">only feasible way to take into account/to measure the </del>customary dimension of this indicator <del class="diffmod">is</del><ins class="diffmod">will only be considered</ins> when it has been legally <del class="diffmod">recognised, and therefore incorporated in the legal framework</del><ins class="diffmod">recognized</ins>. </p>
<p><strong><ins class="mod">Proxy F:</ins></strong> Does the legal and policy framework mandate women&#x2019;s participation in land management and administration institutions?</p>
<p>Land related institutions are responsible for governing the land tenure systems<del class="diffdel">,</del> and are in charge of land administration and management. Women are often excluded from participating in the day-to-day processes of land governance at all levels, and therefore have limited capacity to influence decision-making. A lack of women&#x2019;s representation in land governance tends to lead to biased outcomes in land recording and registration processes and the hindering of women&#x2019;s land claims, for instance by overlooking women&#x2019;s rights on common lands. </p>
<p>Proxy F aims to identify provisions within the legal framework requiring mandatory participation of women (quotas) in land related management and administration institutions.</p>
<p>Since Proxy F amounts to a &#x201C;special measure&#x201D;, as per Art. 4 of CEDAW, countries that do not include this measure in their legal and policy framework, yet provide official national statistical data showing the achievement of at least 40 percent of women&#x2019;s ownership and/or control over land (e.g. data on SDG 5.a.1, or 1.4.2.), will equally satisfy the proxy.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.b.

<p>FAO provides<ins class="diffins">&nbsp;technical</ins> support to the national legal expert and designated focal point(s) from the nominated responsible institution for SDG indicator 5.a.2 to carry out the assessment and fill the questionnaire<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;closely following the methodological guidelines prepared by FAO</del>. To facilitate the process FAO also shares with them relevant materials, including the methodological guidelines &#x201C;Realizing women&#x2019;s rights to land in the law&#x201D;, the questionnaire and the e-learning <ins class="diffins">platform </ins>(<a href="https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=364">https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=364</a>).

Treatment of missing values (i) at country level and (ii) at regional level (IMPUTATION)</div></div></div><p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>
<p>Although data availability is ensured and all UN countries are expected to report, this might not be the case. Different countries may report at different times and a non-negligible share of countries may choose not to report on the indicator at all during the reporting period creating missing values.</p>
<p>The missing values will be treated in the following way:</p>
<p>a) For countries, which have reported in only 1 period, FAO does not have information on whether they are making progress on the indicator. However, FAO can<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;take a few steps to</del> alleviate the problem with missing values. First, FAO can assume that there was no progress on the indicator over the reporting periods. This can be easily determined by looking at the submitted questionnaire for identifying the date of adoption of the relevant instruments (laws). </p>
<p>b) The only way to include countries that will never report is to cluster them in a category of missing information. This is because no assumption can be done regarding the status of each country&#x2019;s laws. However, it is important to keep track of the countries which do not report rather than limit the analysis to the reporting countries</p>
<p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>
<p>The regional and global aggregates will be based solely on those countries for which data are available, but at no point <ins class="diffins">will </ins>countries with missing data<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;will</del> be treated as if they were the same as those for which data are available. The global or regional aggregates would be valid for the reporting countries but not necessarily for the region as whole or at the global level as a whole. Missing values for individual countries or areas cannot be imputed or estimated to derive regional or global aggregates of the indicator because no assumption can be done regarding the status of each country&#x2019;s laws<ins class="diffins">.</ins></p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.g.

<p>As there is currently no treatment of missing values at country level, regional and global aggregates will be based solely on those countries for which data are available. This may result in users interpreting these aggregates as pertaining to all countries in the region, which is the equivalent of treating countries with missing data as if they were the same as those for which data are available.</p>
<p>In the first <del class="diffdel">expected reporting period, which is 2020, we will only have one data point per country. In the first </del>reporting period, we can only measure and report the shares of countries in each of the 6 bands<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;as well as the share of countries which have not reported yet</del>. This first reporting period will also serve as the baseline against which future progress will be measured.</p>
<h2>Obtaining internationally comparable data for global monitoring:</h2>
