Definition and concepts (STAT_CONC_DEF)</div></div></div><p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
<p>Indicator 5.a.2 looks at the extent to which the legal framework (including customary law) guarantees women&#x2019;s equal rights to land ownership and/or control. </p>
<p>The indicator &#x201C;measures&#x201D; the level to which a country&#x2019;s legal framework supports women&#x2019;s land rights, by testing that framework against six proxies drawn from international law and internationally accepted good practices , in particular the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) ratified by 189 countries, and the Voluntary Guidelines for the Responsible Governance of the Tenure of Land Fisheries and Forestry (VGGT) endorsed unanimously by Committee of Food Security (CFS) members in 2012.</p>
<p>The six proxies through which indicator 5.a.2 is monitored are the following:</p>
<p>Proxy A: Joint registration of land compulsory or encouraged through economic incentives</p>
<p>Proxy B: Compulsory spousal consent for land transactions</p>
<p>Proxy C: Women&#x2019;s and girls&#x2019; equal inheritance rights</p>
<p>Proxy D: Allocation of financial resources to increase women&#x2019;s ownership and control over land</p>
<p>Proxy E: In legal systems that recognise customary land tenure, existence of explicit protection of the land rights of women</p>
<p>Proxy F: Mandatory quotas for women&#x2019;s participation in land management and administration institutions</p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p>The indicator tracks progress on legal reforms that guarantee women&#x2019;s land rights (including customary) in terms of ownership and/or control. </p>
<p>The indicator refers to customary law. The inclusion of the customary dimension in the indicator is very important because in many contexts in which these systems prevail, women&#x2019;s land rights tend to be denied or insecure. However, the enormous diversity of customs and social norms that govern customary land among countries and their unwritten nature, create a significant challenge for assessing whether the proxies are present in these systems. To solve this issue, it is proposed that the customary dimension will be considered only when the formal legal framework recognizes customary land tenure. </p>
<p>Finally, the indicator refers to ownership and/or control of land which are two critical but different dimensions regarding women&#x2019;s land rights. Land ownership refers to the legally recognised right to acquire, to use and to transfer landed property, while the control over land is associated with the ability to make decisions over land.</p>
<p>Key definitions are the following:</p>
<p>Land</p>
<p>Land is defined as all immovable property &#x2013; for instance the house, the land upon which a house is built and land which is used for other purposes, such as agricultural production. It also encompasses any other structures built on land to meet permanent purposes. Legal frameworks commonly use the terms &#x2018;immovable property&#x2019; or &#x2018;real property&#x2019; when referring to land.</p>
<p>Land ownership</p>
<p>Land ownership is a legally recognised right to acquire, to use and to transfer land. In private property systems, this is a right akin to a freehold tenure. In systems where land is owned by the state, the term land ownership refers to possession of the rights most akin to ownership in a private property system &#x2013; for instance, long-term leases, occupancy, tenancy or use rights granted by the state that are transferrable and are granted to users for several decades (for instance 99 years).</p>
<p>Control over land</p>
<p>Control over land is the ability to make decisions over land. It may include rights to make decisions about how the land should be used, including what crops should be planted, and to benefit financially from the sale of crops, including what crops should be planted, and to benefit financially from the sale of crops. </p>
<p>Customary land tenure</p>
<p>Customary land tenure is defined as the bodies of rules and institutions governing the way land and natural resources are held, managed, used and transacted within customary legal systems.</p>
<p>Customary legal systems</p>
<p>Customary legal systems are systems that exist at the local or community level, that have not been set up by the state, and that derive their legitimacy from the values and traditions of the indigenous or local group. Customary legal systems may or may not be recognized by national law. </p>
<p>Legal and policy framework</p>
<p>The legal and policy framework encompasses the Constitution, policy, primary legislation and secondary legislation. The legal and policy framework includes customary legal systems where they have been recognised by statutory law.</p>
<p>Personal laws </p>
<p>Personal law is defined as a set of codified rules and norms applying to a group of people sharing a common religious faith with regard to personal matters. These laws usually cover family relations, marriage, and inheritance. The term can be used interchangeably with &#x2018;religious laws&#x2019;.</p>
<p>Primary legislation </p>
<p>Primary legislation refers to (i) acts or statutes that have been formally adopted at national level following the official parliamentary procedure for the passage of laws (in parliamentary systems); (ii) other acts at the national level with the force of law, such as decree-laws and legislative decrees and otherwise (in parliamentary systems); (iii) other legal instruments that have that have been formally endorsed by a law-making body, for instance presidential and royal orders or presidential and royal decrees (in non-parliamentary systems or systems where law-making power lies in an additional institution to the parliament). In all cases, primary legislation must have the force of law, be binding. For the purposes of this assessment primary legislation also includes the Constitution. </p>
<p>Secondary legislation</p>
<p>Secondary legislation includes subsidiary, delegated or subordinate legal instruments that have the force of law, are binding and shall not be in contradiction with primary legislation. They are usually passed by the executive, such as national regulations, rules, by-laws, determinations, directions, circulars, orders, and implementing decrees.</p>
<p>Joint registration</p>
<p>Joint registration is where the names of both spouses or both partners in an unmarried couple, are entered into the land registry as the owners or principal users of the land being registered. Joint registration signifies a form of shared tenure over the land &#x2013; usually either a joint tenancy/occupancy or a tenancy in common). In legal systems which include a framework for land titling, joint registration is commonly referred to as joint titling.<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p>
<p>Unmarried couples</p>
<p>Unmarried couples are defined as couples who live together (cohabit) in an intimate relationship, but who are not married in accordance with the marriage law of the country. Often this will refer to couples who were married under custom or religious laws, where such marriages are not recognised or do not comply with the requirements of the formal law. It may also refer to relationships that are recognised by the state but that are not considered a marriage &#x2013; for instance a civil partnership and a de facto relationship that is registered with the state. The term &#x2018;unmarried couples&#x2019; is often used interchangeably with &#x2018;de facto unions&#x2019;, &#x2018;consensual unions&#x2019; or &#x2018;irregular unions&#x2019;. The members of an unmarried couple are referred to as &#x2018;partners&#x2019;.</p>
<p>Land transactions</p>
<p>Land transactions for the purpose of the methodology are major land transactions, specifically the sale and encumbrance (mortgage) of land. </p>
<p>Inheritance</p>
<p>Inheritance is defined as property passing at the owner&apos;s death to the heir or those entitled to succeed.</p>
<p>Deceased&#x2019;s estate</p>
<p>The deceased&#x2019;s estate encompasses the legal rights, interests and entitlements, to property of any kind (not only land) which the deceased spouse or partner enjoyed at the time of death, less any liabilities. Depending on the legal system, marital property may be excluded fully from the calculation of deceased&#x2019;s estate, or, the deceased&#x2019;s 50% share in the marital property will be included. </p>
<p>Equal inheritance rights for sons and daughters</p>
<p>Equal inheritance rights for sons and daughters refer to the situation when the lines of succession in the legal and policy framework governing inheritance states equality of rank and shares between brothers and sisters or between daughters and sons, or are gender neutral.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">3.b. Data collection method (COLL_METHOD)</div></div></div><p>For the purpose of the official reporting at the global level, ONLY the proxies localized in the primary and/or secondary law will be reported because of their binding nature. The only exception to this rule is Proxy D where also national wide programs are considered for the purpose of the assessment. However, for the meaningfulness of the assessment, relevant policies are considered for the analysis because they represent the foundations of the law setting out the principles that indicate the direction towards which the country aims to move and very often suggest reforms that need to be adopted in the legal framework. In this sense, if the proxies are present in these types of instruments they constitute an important step towards a more gender sensitive legal framework.</p>
<p>The data are extracted directly from the laws in force at the moment when the assessment is carried out. Data collection/provision entails the assessment of the relevant laws to determine if the six proxies are present or not in the legal framework. Data will be compiled in an electronic questionnaire organized as follows:</p>
<p>Section 1: General Instructions </p>
<p>&#x2022;. Respondant Information</p>
<p>&#x2022; Instructions for filling the questionnaire</p>
<p>Section 2: Legal Assessment</p>
<p>&#x2022;. Checklist of policy and legal instruments relevant for the assessment in order to guide the expert in the identification of the proxies in the policy and legal framework of the country analysed.</p>
<p>&#x2022;. Form 1 &#x201C;Policy and legal instruments, including provisions for Proxy (x)&#x201D;. This form composed of a set of questions to be answered (YES or No) to determine if the proxy is present. The details of the instruments containing the Proxy are to be provided in this form.</p>
<p>&#x2022;. Form 2 &#x201C;results of Assessment &#x2013; Proxy (x)&#x201D;. This form summarizes the results of the assessment for each proxy.</p>
<p>Section 3: Summary of the Assessment (Country Results)</p>
<p>To complete the indicator 5.a.2 assessment, national legal experts must examine the national legal and policy framework and complete the electronic questionnaire following the methodological guidelines. This involves three steps that must be repeated for each proxy. </p>
<p>1. Collect all the relevant policy and legal documents, using the checklist contained in the electronic questionnaire as a guide as to the instruments to check for the concerned proxy.</p>
<p>2. Using the detailed methodological guidelines, determine whether the proxy exists in the legal and policy framework and in which instruments. </p>
<p>3. Complete the questionnaire for each proxy, citing the instrument and the relevant provisions where the proxy was located as well as any further relevant information or exception. Include a hyperlink to the text of the legal and policy instrument. </p>
<p>After these three steps have been undertaken for all six proxies the national responsible institution will identify the level of protection to women&#x2019;s land rights present in the legal framework according to the number of proxies located. </p>
<p>The filled questionnaire will be communicated to FAO for the quality control and global reporting to the UN SDGs Secretariat.<del class="diffdel">&nbsp;</del></p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.c. Method of computation (DATA_COMP)</div></div></div><p>The qualitative and legal nature of this indicator required the development of nuanced and articulated methodology that could be feasible, universally relevant and meaningful. </p>
<p>The computation of results under Indicator 5.a.2 involves two steps: (1) classification of country according the number of proxies located <strong>in primary or primary and secondary legislation</strong> and (2) consolidation of all country results for global reporting.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Classification categories of country </h2>
<p>The country will be classified according to the total number of proxies found in <u>primary legislation</u> or <u>primary and secondary legislation</u>. Given that <strong>not in all countries</strong> customary land tenure rules exist or customary law is recognised (related to proxy E), for the purpose of computation a two-scale (or dual) approach has been developed: </p>
<p>For countries where customary land tenure is <strong>NOT</strong> recognised in the legal framework (either via statute or the constitution), regardless of whether it exists <em>de facto </em>or not, Proxy E is marked <strong>non-applicable</strong> and the country will be assessed out of the five remaining proxies. </p>
<p>For countries where customary land tenure is recognised in the legal framework, the country will be assessed against all six proxies,</p>
<p>The table below describes the dual approach classification and the classification bands. As is shown below, in countries where customary law is applicable (Proxy E) the presence of five or six proxies are included in the same band (band 6 - very high levels of guarantees). This is due to the necessity of making universal the calculation of the component of customary law - a component of the indicator which in itself is not universal to all countries.</p>

<p>Under the methodology all proxies have an equal weight.

<p>FAO provides support to the national legal expert and designated focal point(s) from the nominated responsible institution for SDG indicator 5.a.2 to carry out the assessment and fill the questionnaire closely following the methodological guidelines prepared by FAO. To facilitate the process FAO also shares with them relevant materials, including the methodological guidelines &#x201C;Realizing women&#x2019;s rights to land in the law&#x201D;, the questionnaire and the e-learning (<a href="https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=364">https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=364</a>). These materials currently exist in English, French and Spanish. When the assessment has been finalized the responsible institution submit the questionnaire to FAO for the quality control. FAO&#x2019; s focal point for the indicator and legal experts review the report against the criteria set in the methodology for each proxy. The reviewed questionnaire is then sent back to the <del class="diffdel">the </del>country for validation.

<p>As there is currently no treatment of missing values at country level, regional and global aggregates will be based solely on those countries for which data are available. This may result in users interpreting these aggregates as pertaining to all countries in the region, which is the equivalent of treating countries with missing data as if they were the same as those for which data are available.</p>
<p>In the first expected reporting period, which is 2020, we will only have one data point per country. In the first reporting period, we can only measure and report the shares of countries in each of the 6 bands as well as the share of countries which have not reported yet. This first reporting period will also serve as the baseline against which future progress will be measured.</p>
<h2>Obtaining internationally comparable data for global monitoring:</h2>
<p>As noted above delegated national institutions will be responsible for undertaking the legal assessment at the national level. It is recommended that the results of the final assessment are shared widely and validated by a cross-section of relevant institutions prior to final submission to FAO.</p>
<p>Both the national legal expert(s) and institutions carrying out the assessment and the FAO Gender and Land Rights team will follow the detailed Guidelines in assessing whether the proxy is present or not present in the legal framework. The detailed Guidelines are a mechanism to ensure the robustness and comparability of the data collected at the national level, and to ensure that like situations are treated like. The initial legal research for developing the methodology and its piloting process in different regions/contexts were invaluable in delineating the threshold of each proxy and ensuring that countries are treated equitably under the methodology in terms of the different ways in which the proxies may appear in national legislation. A good example of this is proxy B, spousal consent for land transactions, under which the Guidelines provide outline which type of legal provisions meet the proxy threshold with specific reference to the three different marital regimes &#x2013; separate, partial community or community property. Similarly, the methodology provides clear guidance on how to treat legal regimes that do not provide for private ownership &#x2013; by providing examples of what type of &#x2018;ownership&#x2019; would equate the equivalent to a freehold estate under systems where all land is owned by the state. </p></div>
