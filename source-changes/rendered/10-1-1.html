Data sources (SOURCE_TYPE)</div></div></div><p>The Global Database of Shared Prosperity was prepared by the Global Poverty Working Group, which comprises poverty measurement specialists of different departments of the World Bank Group. The database&#x2019;s primary source of data is the World Bank Group&#x2019;s <del class="diffmod">PovcalNet</del><ins class="diffmod">Poverty</ins> <del class="diffmod">database</del><ins class="diffmod">and Inequality Platform (PIP)</ins>, an interactive computational tool that allows users to replicate the World Bank Group&#x2019;s official poverty estimates measured at international poverty lines ($1.90, $3.20 or $5.50 per day per capita). The datasets included in <del class="diffmod">PovcalNet</del><ins class="diffmod">PIP</ins> are provided and reviewed by the members of the Global Poverty Working Group. The choice of consumption or income to measure shared prosperity for a country is consistent with the welfare aggregate used to estimate extreme poverty rates in <del class="diffmod">PovcalNet</del><ins class="diffmod">PIP</ins>, unless there are strong arguments for using a different welfare aggregate. The practice adopted by the World Bank Group for estimating global and regional poverty rates is, in principle, to use per capita consumption expenditure as the welfare measure wherever available and to use income as the welfare measure for countries for which consumption data are unavailable. However, in some cases data on consumption may be available but are outdated or not shared with the World Bank Group for recent survey years. In these cases, if data on income are available, income is used for estimating shared prosperity.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">4.c. Method of computation (DATA_COMP)</div></div></div><p>Growth rates are calculated as annualized average growth rates over a roughly five-year period. Since many countries do not conduct surveys on a precise five-year schedule, the following rules guide selection of the survey years used to calculate the growth rates in the <del class="diffmod">2021</del><ins class="diffmod">2022</ins> update: the final year of the growth period (T1) is the most recent year of a survey but no earlier than <del class="diffmod">2016</del><ins class="diffmod">2017</ins>, and the initial year (T0) is as close to T1 &#x2013; 5 as possible, within a two-year band. Thus the gap between initial and final survey years ranges from three to seven years. If two surveys are equidistant from T1 &#x2013; 5, other things being equal, the more recent survey year is selected as T0. The comparability of welfare aggregates (income or consumption) for the years chosen for T0 and T1 is assessed for every country. If comparability across the two surveys is a major concern, the selection criteria are re-applied to select the next best survey year.</p>
<p>Once two surveys are selected for a country, the annualized growth of mean per capita real income or consumption is computed by first estimating the mean per capita real income or consumption of the bottom 40 percent of the welfare distribution in years T0 and T1 and then computing the annual average growth rate between those years using a compound growth formula, (Mean in T_1/Mean in T_0 )^(1/( T_1- T_0 ))-1. Growth of mean per capita real income or consumption of the total population is computed in the same way using data for the total population.</p></div><div class="sdg-diff-section"><div class="d2h-file-header"><div class="d2h-file-name-wrapper"><div class="d2h-file-name">5.
