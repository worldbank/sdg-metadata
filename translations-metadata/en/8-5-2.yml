  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> </p>

  <p>The unemployment rate conveys the percentage of persons in the labour force
  who are unemployed. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong> </p>

  <p>Unemployed persons are defined as all those of working age (usually aged 15
  and above) who were not in employment, carried out activities to seek
  employment during a specified recent period and were currently available to
  take up employment given a job opportunity, where: (a) &#x201C;not in
  employment&#x201D; is assessed with respect to the short reference period for
  the measurement of employment; (b) to &#x201C;seek employment&#x201D; refers
  to any activity when carried out, during a specified recent period comprising
  the last four weeks or one month, for the purpose of finding a job or setting
  up a business or agricultural undertaking; (c) the point when the enterprise
  starts to exist should be used to distinguish between search activities aimed
  at setting up a business and the work activity itself, as evidenced by the
  enterprise&#x2019;s registration to operate or by when financial resources
  become available, the necessary infrastructure or materials are in place or
  the first client or order is received, depending on the context; (d)
  &#x201C;currently available&#x201D; serves as a test of readiness to start a
  job in the present, assessed with respect to a short reference period
  comprising that used to measure employment (depending on national
  circumstances, the reference period may be extended to include a short
  subsequent period not exceeding two weeks in total, so as to ensure adequate
  coverage of unemployment situations among different population groups). </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Persons in employment are defined as all those of working age (usually aged
  15 and above) who, during a short reference period such as one week or one
  day, were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay
  or profit. The difference between the 13th and 19th ICLS series for a given
  country is the operational criteria used to define employment, with two series
  based on the statistical standards from the 13th International Conference of
  Labour Statisticians (ICLS) and the other two series based on 19th ICLS
  standards. In the 19th ICLS series, employment is defined more narrowly as
  work done for pay or profit, while activities not done mainly in exchange for
  remuneration (i.e., own-use production work, volunteer work and unpaid trainee
  work) are recognized as other forms of work.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>The labour force corresponds to the sum of persons in employment and in
  unemployment. </p>

  <p>For more information on the definitions of employment and unemployment
  refer to the Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour
  underutilization Adopted by the 19<sup>th</sup> International Conference of
  Labour Statisticians. </p>

  <p> </p>
UNIT_MEASURE: <p>Percent (%)</p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>Disability status is based on the WHO International Classification of
  Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), according to which disability covers
  impairments (problems in body function or structure such as a significant
  deviation or loss), activity limitations (difficulties in executing
  activities) and participation restrictions (problems in involvement in life
  situations). For measurement purposes, the ICF defines a person with
  disability as a person who is limited in the kind or amount of activities that
  he or she can do because of ongoing difficulties due to a long-term physical
  condition, mental condition or health problem.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The preferred official national data source for this indicator is a
  household-based labour force survey. </p>

  <p>In the absence of a labour force survey, a population census and/or other
  type of household surveys with an appropriate employment module may also be
  used to obtain the required data. It is important to note that unemployment
  data derived from employment office records or unemployment registers would
  not refer to unemployment (as defined for the purposes of this indicator,
  using the three-criteria of being without a job, seeking employment and
  available for employment) but to registered unemployment, and thus, it would
  not be comparable with indicator 8.5.2. </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The ILO Department of Statistics processes national household survey
  microdata sets in line with internationally agreed indicator concepts and
  definitions set forth by the International Conference of Labour Statisticians.
  For data that could not be obtained through this processing or directly from
  government websites, the ILO sends out an annual ILOSTAT questionnaire to all
  relevant agencies within each country (national statistical office, labour
  ministry, etc.) requesting the latest annual data and any revisions on
  numerous labour market topics and indicators, including many SDG indicators.
  </p>
FREQ_COLL: <p>Continuous</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: <p>Continuous</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>Mainly national statistical offices, and in some cases labour ministries or
  other related agencies, at the country-level. In some cases, regional or
  international statistical offices can also act as data providers. </p>
COMPILING_ORG: <p>International Labour Organization (ILO)</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The ILO is the UN focal point for labour statistics. It sets international
  standards for labour statistics through the International Conference of Labour
  Statisticians. It also compiles and produces labour statistics with the goal
  of disseminating internationally comparable datasets and provides technical
  assistance and training to ILO Member States to support their efforts to
  produce high quality labour market data.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The unemployment rate is a useful measure of the underutilization of the
  labour supply. It reflects the inability of an economy to generate employment
  for those persons who want to work but are not doing so, even though they are
  available for employment and actively seeking work. It is thus seen as an
  indicator of the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy to absorb its
  labour force and of the performance of the labour market. Short-term time
  series of the unemployment rate can be used to signal changes in the business
  cycle; upward movements in the indicator often coincide with recessionary
  periods or in some cases with the beginning of an expansionary period as
  persons previously not in the labour market begin to test conditions through
  an active job search. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Even though in most developed countries the unemployment rate is useful as
  an indicator of labour market performance, and specifically, as a key measure
  of labour underutilization, in many developing countries, the significance and
  meaning of the unemployment rate could be questioned. In the absence of
  unemployment insurance systems or social safety nets, persons of working age
  must avoid unemployment, resorting to engaging in some form of economic
  activity, however insignificant or inadequate. Thus, in this context, other
  measures should supplement the unemployment rate to comprehensively assess
  labour underutilization. </p>

DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>The ILO engages in annual consultations with Member States through the
  ILOSTAT questionnaire and related Statistics Reporting System (StaRS).
  National data providers receive a link to the portal where they can review all
  national SDG data available on ILOSTAT.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>Through the ILO Harmonized Microdata initiative, the ILO strives to produce
  internationally comparable labour statistics based on the indicator concepts
  and definitions adopted by the International Conference of Labour
  Statisticians.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <ul>
    <li><strong>At country level </strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Multivariate regression techniques are used to impute missing values at the
  country level. However, the imputed missing country values are only used to
  calculate the global and regional estimates; they are not used for
  international reporting on the SDG indicators by the ILO. </p>

  <p>For further information on the estimates, please refer to the ILO modelled
  estimates methodological overview, available at <a
  href="https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/TEM.pdf">https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/TEM.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>At regional and global levels </strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Regional and global figures are aggregates of the country-level figures
  including the imputed values.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>To address the problem of missing data, the ILO designed several
  econometric models which are used to produce estimates of labour market
  indicators based on the 13<sup>th</sup> ICLS standards in the countries and
  years for which real data are not available. The unemployment estimates
  derived from the ILO modelled estimates are used to produce global and
  regional estimates on unemployment rates. These models use multivariate
  regression techniques to impute missing values at the country level, which are
  then aggregated to produce regional and global estimates. For further
  information on the estimates, please refer to the ILO modelled estimates
  methodological overview, available at <a
  href="https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/TEM.pdf">https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/TEM.pdf</a>.</p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>To calculate this indicator (according to the ILO definitions of
  unemployment and unemployment rate), data is needed on both the labour force
  and the unemployed, by sex and age (and eventually disability status). This
  data is collected at the national level mainly through labour force surveys
  (or other types of household surveys with an employment module). For the
  methodology of each national household survey, one must refer to the most
  comprehensive survey report or to the methodological publications of the
  national statistical office in question. </p>

  <p>For further information, see section 7 with references and documentation.
  </p>
QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>The processes of compilation, production, and publication of data,
  including its quality control, are carried out following the methodological
  framework and standards established by the ILO Department of Statistics, in
  compliance with the information technology and management standards of the
  ILO.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>Data consistency and quality checks are regularly conducted for validation
  of the data before dissemination in the ILOSTAT database.</p>

  <p> </p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>The final assessment of the quality of information is carried out by the
  Data Production and Analysis Unit of the ILO Department of Statistics. In
  cases of doubt about the quality of specific data, these values are reviewed
  with the participation of the national agencies responsible for producing the
  data if appropriate. If the issues cannot be clarified, the respective
  information is not published. </p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>Data disaggregated by sex and age for this indicator is available for 217
  countries and territories in the 13<sup>th</sup> ICLS series and 126 countries
  and territories in the 19<sup>th</sup> ICLS series. </p>

  <p>The indicator is widely available based on real observations provided by
  countries and derived from national labour force surveys, other types of
  household surveys or population census. </p>

  <p>However, the disaggregation by disability is not as widely available and
  this submission only includes 109 countries and territories in the
  13<sup>th</sup> ICLS series and 73 countries and territories in the
  19<sup>th</sup> ICLS series. </p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong><br>Data for disaggregation by sex and age for
  this indicator is available as of 2000 for countries in the SDG Indicators
  Global Database, but time series going back further are available in ILOSTAT.
  Global and regional aggregates disaggregated by sex and age are available
  through 2022.</p>

  <p>Data for disaggregation by disability status is available for the period
  from 2003 to 2022 at the country level. </p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>This indicator should, ideally, be disaggregated by sex, age group and
  disability status. </p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>Differences in the questionnaires used in the household surveys as the
  basic measurement tool may entail differences in specific definitions of
  employment and unemployment, differences in the treatment of specific groups
  or differences in the operational criteria used to determine the
  individual&#x2019;s labour force status. </p>

  <p>Work statistics for countries not using the same set of statistical
  standards are not comparable. As such, each series is based on a single set of
  standards (i.e., 13<sup>th</sup> or 19<sup>th</sup> ICLS) and contains only
  data comparable within and across countries, allowing data users to continue
  making meaningful time series analysis and international comparisons. Users
  should not compare data across series.</p>

  <p>The unemployment rate is dependent on the geographical coverage of the
  survey since urban and rural areas tend to have significant differences in the
  incidence of unemployment. It is important to note that unemployment
  indicators do not convey any information on the characteristics of the
  unemployed (their education level, ethnic origin, socio-economic background,
  work experience, duration of unemployment, etc.), which is crucial to cast
  light on labour market failures.</p>
