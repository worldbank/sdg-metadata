  <p>Definition:</p>

  <p>Proportion of children under 5 years of age whose births have been
  registered with a civil authority.</p>

  <p>Concepts:</p>

  <p>&#x2022; Birth registration: Birth registration is defined as &#x2018;the
  continuous, permanent and universal recording, within the civil registry, of
  the occurrence and characteristics of births in accordance with the legal
  requirements of a country&#x2019;.</p>

  <p>&#x2022; Birth certificate: A birth certificate is a vital record that
  documents the birth of a child. The term &#x2018;birth certificate&#x2019; can
  refer either to the original document certifying the circumstances of the
  birth, or to a certified copy or representation of the registration of that
  birth, depending on the practices of the country issuing the certificate.</p>

  <p>&#x2022; Civil authority: Official authorized to register the occurrence of
  a vital event and to record the required details.</p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

  <p>Censuses, household surveys such as MICS and DHS and national civil
  registration systems.</p>

  <p><strong>Civil registration systems</strong>: Civil registration systems
  that are functioning effectively compile vital statistics that are used to
  compare the estimated total number of births in a country with the absolute
  number of registered births during a given period. These data normally refer
  to live births that were registered within a year or the legal time frame for
  registration applicable in the country.</p>

  <p><strong>Household or other population-based surveys</strong>: In the
  absence of reliable administrative data, household surveys have become a key
  source of data to monitor levels and trends in birth registration. The
  standard indicator used in DHS and MICS to report on birth registration refers
  to the percentage of children under age 5 (0-59 months) with a birth
  certificate, regardless of whether or not it was seen by the interviewer, or
  whose birth was reported as registered with civil authorities at the time of
  survey. Depending on the country, surveys collecting these data may be
  conducted every 3-5 years, or possibly at more frequent intervals.</p>

  <p><strong>Censuses </strong>can also provide data on children who have
  acquired their right to a legal identity. However, censuses are conducted only
  every ten years (in most countries) and are therefore not well-suited for
  routine monitoring.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <ol>
        <li>UNICEF undertakes a wide consultative process of compiling and assessing data from national sources for the purposes of updating its global databases on the situation of children. Up until 2017, the mechanism UNICEF used to collaborate with national authorities on ensuring data quality and international comparability on key indicators of relevance to children was known as Country Data Reporting on the Indicators for the Goals (CRING).</li>
        <li>As of 2018, UNICEF launched a new country consultation process with national authorities on selected child-related global SDG indicators it is custodian or co-custodian to meet emerging standards and guidelines on data flows for global reporting of SDG indicators, which place strong emphasis on technical rigour, country ownership and use of official data and statistics. The consultation process solicited feedback directly from National Statistical Offices, as well as other government agencies responsible for official statistics, on the compilation of the indicators, including the data sources used, and the application of internationally agreed definitions, classification and methodologies to the data from that source. Once reviewed, feedback is made available to countries on whether or not specific data points are accepted, and if not, the reasons why. </li>
      </ol>

FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>UNICEF will undertake an annual country consultation likely between
  December and January every year to allow for review and processing of the
  feedback received in order to meet global SDG reporting deadlines.</p>

  <p>National Statistical Offices (for the most part) and line ministries/other
  government agencies responsible for maintaining national vital registration

COMPILING_ORG: <p>UNICEF </p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>UNICEF is responsible for global monitoring and reporting on the wellbeing
  of children. It provides technical and financial assistance to Member States
  to support their efforts to collect quality data on birth registration,
  including through the UNICEF-supported MICS household survey programme. UNICEF
  also compiles child marriage statistics with the goal of making
  internationally comparable datasets publicly available, and it analyses birth
  registration statistics which are included in relevant data-driven
  publications, including in its flagship publication, <em>The State of the
  World&#x2019;s Children.</em></p>
OTHER_METHOD: ''
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Registering children at birth is the first step in securing their
  recognition before the law, safeguarding their rights, and ensuring that any
  violation of these rights does not go unnoticed.</p>

  <p>Children without official identification documents may be denied health
  care or education. Later in life, the lack of such documentation can mean that
  a child may enter into marriage or the labour market, or be conscripted into
  the armed forces, before the legal age. In adulthood, birth certificates may
  be required to obtain social assistance or a job in the formal sector, to buy
  or prove the right to inherit property, to vote and to obtain a passport. </p>

  <p>Children&#x2019;s right to a name and nationality is enshrined in the
  Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) under Article 7.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The number of children who have acquired their right to a legal identity is
  collected mainly through censuses, civil registration systems and household
  surveys. Civil registration systems that are functioning effectively compile
  vital statistics that are used to compare the estimated total number of births
  in a country with the absolute number of registered births during a given
  period. However, the systematic recording of births in many countries remains
  a serious challenge. In the absence of reliable administrative data, household
  surveys have become a key source of data to monitor levels and trends in birth
  registration. In most low- and middle-income countries, such surveys represent
  the sole source of this information.</p>

  <p>Data from household surveys like MICS or DHS sometimes refer only to
  children with a birth certificate. UNICEF methodically notes this difference
  when publishing country-level estimates for global SDG monitoring.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Number of children under age of five whose births are reported as being
  registered with the relevant national civil authorities divided by the total
  number of children under the age of five in the population multiplied by
  100</p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>A wide consultative process is undertaken to compile, assess and validate
  data from national sources. </p>

  <p>The consultation process solicited feedback directly from National
  Statistical Offices, as well as other government agencies responsible for
  official statistics, on the compilation of the indicators, including the data
  sources used, and the application of internationally agreed definitions,
  classification and methodologies to the data from that source. The results of
  this country consultation are reviewed by UNICEF as the custodian agency. Once
  reviewed, feedback is made available to countries on whether or not specific
  data points are accepted, and if not, the reasons why. </p>
ADJUSTMENT: ''
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p>&#x2022; At country level</p>

  <p>When data for a country are entirely missing, UNICEF does not publish any
  country-level estimate</p>

  <p>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</p>

  <p>The regional average is applied to those countries within the region with
  missing values for the purposes of calculating regional aggregates only, but
  are not published as country-level estimates. Regional aggregates are only
  published when at least 50 per cent of the regional population for the
  relevant age group are covered by the available data.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>The global aggregate is a weighted average of all the sub-regions that make
  up the world. Regional aggregates are weighted averages of all the countries
  within the region. </p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>Substantial differences can exist between CRVS coverage and birth
  registration levels as captured by household surveys. The differences are
  primarily because data from CRVS typically refer to the percentage of all
  births that have been registered (often within a specific timeframe) whereas
  household surveys often represent the percentage of children under age five
  whose births are registered. The latter (the level of registration among
  children under 5) is specified in the SDG indicator.</p>
QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>The process behind the production of reliable statistics on birth
  registration is well established within UNICEF. The quality and process
  leading to the production of the SDG indicator 16.9.1 is ensured by working
  closely with the statistical offices and other relevant stakeholders through a
  consultative process.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>UNICEF maintains the global database on birth registration that is used for
  SDG and other official reporting. Before the inclusion of any data point in
  the database, it is reviewed by technical focal points at UNICEF headquarters
  to check for consistency and overall data quality. This review is based on a
  set of objective criteria to ensure that only the most recent and reliable
  information are included in the databases. These criteria include the
  following: data sources must include proper documentation; data values must be
  representative at the national population level; data are collected using an
  appropriate methodology (e.g., sampling); data values are based on a
  sufficiently large sample; data conform to the standard indicator definition
  including age group and concepts, to the extent possible; data are plausible
  based on trends and consistency with previously published/reported estimates
  for the indicator. </p>

  <p>As of 2018, UNICEF undertakes an annual consultation with government
  authorities on 10 of the child-related SDG indicators in its role of sole or
  joint custodian, and in line with its global monitoring mandate and normative
  commitments to advancing the 2030 Agenda for children. This includes indicator
  16.9.1. More details on the process for the country consultation are outlined
  below. </p>
