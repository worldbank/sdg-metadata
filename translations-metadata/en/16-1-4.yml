SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS: >-
  <p>This indicator complements the other indicators of Target 16.1, which focus
  on the rate of intentional homicide (16.1.1), the rate of conflict-related
  deaths (16.1.2) and the proportion of the population subjected to physical,
  psychological, and sexual violence (16.1.3). It also relates to indicator
  16.3.1, which refers to the proportion of victims of violence in the previous
  12 months who reported their victimization to competent authorities. By
  providing a perception-based measure of safety in the local neighbourhood,
  indicator 16.1.4 provides a more holistic picture of people&#x2019;s everyday
  experience of insecurity, crime and violence.</p>

  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>This indicator refers to the proportion of the adult population who feel
  safe walking alone in their neighbourhood at night.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>&#x201C;Neighbourhood&#x201D; &#x2013; the indicator aims to capture fear
  of crime in the context of people&#x2019;s everyday lives. It does so by
  limiting the area in question to the &#x201C;neighbourhood&#x201D; or
  &#x201C;area they live in&#x201D;. Various other formulations of local
  neighbourhood may be appropriate depending on cultural, physical and language
  context.</p>

  <p>&#x201C;At night&#x201D;- the indicator should specifically capture
  respondent&#x2019;s feelings and perceptions when walking alone at night/after
  dark. The specific reference to that point of the day is important because
  according to research,<sup><a href="#footnote-2"
  id="footnote-ref-2">[1]</a></sup> darkness is one of the factors individuals
  perceive as important when assessing whether a situation is dangerous.</p><div

UNIT_MEASURE: <p>Proportion/percentage</p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: <p>Not applicable</p>
SRC_TYPE_COLL_METHOD: ''
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The indicator is based on a single survey question (&#x2018;How safe do you
  feel walking alone in your area/neighbourhood at night?&#x2019;) to be
  included in a general population survey. The question can be an add-on survey
  module to be incorporated into other ongoing general population surveys (such
  as surveys on corruption, governance, quality of life, public attitudes or
  surveys on other topics) or be part of dedicated surveys on crime
  victimisation.</p>

  <p>Data should be collected as part of a nationally representative probability
  sample of adult population residing in the country, irrespective of legal
  residence status. The sampling frame and sample design should ensure that
  results can be disaggregated at sub-national level. It is recommended that the
  sample size is sufficiently large to allow for disaggregation by age, gender,
  ethnicity, and other relevant.</p>

  <p>The survey documentation should provide the specific wording used to
  collect data on fear of crime/perceptions of safety, enable the identification
  of possible discrepancies from standard definitions, and allow an assessment
  of the overall data quality (e.g. sample size, target population, agency
  responsible for the data collection, etc.).</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>At the international level, data are collected by UNODC through the annual
  United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of the Criminal Justice
  Systems (UN-CTS) data collection initiative.<sup><a href="#footnote-3"
  id="footnote-ref-3">[2]</a></sup> Data are produced at the national level and
  sent to UNODC by Member States, usually through national UN-CTS Focal Points,
  which in most cases are national institutions responsible for data production
  in the area of crime and criminal justice (National Statistical Offices,
  Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Justice, etc.). Since 2016, the UN-CTS
  collects available nationally produced survey data on fear of crime as part of
  its victimisation module in the UN-CTS. When necessary, other data sources may
  be used, including from websites, publications, other forms of
  communication.</p>

  <p>Data for SDG monitoring will be sent to countries for consultation prior to
  publication.</p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup class="footnote-number"

FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>Countries are encouraged to conduct surveys on crime victimisation in
  regular intervals, but at least every four years to reflect progress between
  each of the quadrennial reviews of Goal 16 at the High-Level Political Forum
  (HLPF).</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>Data on relevant SDG indicators are collected, compiled and sent back to
  countries for data review annually. Data are then reported to UNSD through the
  regular reporting channels annually.</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>Data are collected through official nationally representative surveys. In
  most cases, such surveys are conducted by National Statistical Offices (NSOs).
  In some cases, other national institutions or other entities may conduct such
  surveys according to the same methodological standards.</p>
COMPILING_ORG: <p>UNODC</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>UNODC &#x2013; as custodian of the UN standards and norms in crime
  prevention and criminal justice, UNODC assists Member States in reforming
  their criminal justice systems in order to be effective, fair and humane for
  the entire population. UNODC develops technical tools to assist Member States
  in implementing the UN standards and norms and supports Member States through
  the provision of technical assistance in crime prevention and criminal justice
  reform. It does so through several Global programmes and through the UNODC
  field office network.</p>
OTHER_METHOD: ''
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Perception of safety is considered a subjective wellbeing indicator. It
  affects the way in which human beings interact with their surroundings, their
  health, and consequently, their quality of life. Indicator 16.1.4 taps into
  the concept of &#x2018;fear of crime&#x2019;, which has been elicited in
  dozens of crime victimization surveys, and the standard formulation used here
  has been shown to be applicable in different cultural contexts.<sup><a
  href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4">[3]</a></sup> It is important to note
  that fear of crime is a phenomenon that is separate from the prevalence of
  crime and that fear of crime may be even largely independent from actual
  experience. The perception of crime and the resulting fear of it is influenced
  by several factors, such as the awareness of crime, the public discussion, the
  media discourse, and personal circumstances. Nevertheless, fear of crime is an
  important indicator in itself as high levels of fear can negatively influence
  well-being and lead to reduced contacts with the public, reduced trust and
  engagement in the community, and thus represent an obstacle to development.
  Fear of crime also differs across demographic groups and this indicator helps
  to identify vulnerable groups.</p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup
  class="footnote-number" id="footnote-4">3</sup><p> UNODC-UNECE (2010) Manual
  on Victimization Surveys, p. 56. <a
  href="#footnote-ref-4">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Victimization surveys (as dedicated surveys or as modules of household
  surveys) are usually restricted to the general population living in households
  above a certain age (typically 15 or 18 years of age), while sometimes an
  upper age limit is also applied (typically 65, 70 or 75 years of age).</p>

  <p>There are several limitations associated with the wording of the survey
  question used to measure fear of crime (&#x2018;How safe do you feel walking
  alone in your area/neighbourhood at night?&#x2019;). First, the question
  assumes that respondents do the following: (1) go out, (2) go out alone, (3)
  go out in their neighbourhood, and (4) go out after dark. For many
  respondents, the reasons for not going out alone in their neighbourhood after
  dark may have nothing or little to do with crime and more to do with personal
  and circumstantial issues, such as lack of mobility, childcare commitments, or
  the use of a car that allows them to travel further afield. Second, the
  question does not define the meaning of &#x201C;neighbourhood&#x201D;, which
  may mean different things to different respondents, even those living in the
  same street. Third, the question does not explicitly refer to
  &#x2018;crime&#x2019;, but rather it is implicit in the question. There may be
  other reasons unrelated to crime (e.g. wild animals, traffic, etc.) why
  respondents may not feel safe walking around their neighbourhood after
  dark.<sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5">[4]</a></sup></p><div
  class="footnotes"><div><sup class="footnote-number" id="footnote-5">4</sup><p>
  UNODC-UNECE (2010) Manual on Victimization Surveys, p. 57. <a
  href="#footnote-ref-5">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The question used in victimization surveys is: How safe do you feel walking
  alone in your area/neighbourhood at night? Answer options are typically: (1)
  Very safe, (2) safe, (3) unsafe (4), very unsafe, (5) I never go out alone at
  night/does not apply, (99) don&#x2019;t know.<sup><a href="#footnote-6"
  id="footnote-ref-6">[5]</a></sup> The proportion of population that feel safe
  is calculated by summing up the number of respondents who feel &#x201C;very
  safe&#x201D; and &#x201C;safe&#x201D; and dividing the total by the total
  number of respondents, and multiplying by 100.</p>

DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>The data for the indicator is collected through household surveys conducted
  by National Statistics Offices (NSOs) or other institutions following tight
  survey protocols and complying with the metadata. Data producers are
  encouraged to strictly follow the data quality practices, protocols and
  frameworks in relation of data quality. In addition to the data, countries are
  requested to report on the metadata which serves as one additional layer of
  validation and verification of the data by confronting with the metadata used
  and the recommended for global reporting. Before publication by custodian
  agencies, a standardised &#x201C;pre-publication process&#x201D; is
  implemented, where national stakeholders can verify and review the data before
  publication. </p>

QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>It is recommended that NSOs serve as the main contact for compiling and
  assuring the quality of the necessary data to report on SDG 16.1.4, in close

  substantive validation procedures are in place when data are processed by
  custodian agencies to assess their consistency and compliance with
  standards.</p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>UNODC will make available a quality assessment protocol for national
  statistics office to be used at national level and intended to assess the
  alignment of data produced with user&#x2019;s needs, the compliance with
  guidelines in terms of computations, the timeliness of data production, the
  accessibility of statistics produced, the consistent use of methodology both
  in terms of geographic representation and through time, the coherence in terms
  of data production, and the architecture of data production.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p>A growing number of countries are implementing surveys using similar
  methodologies in order to assess the population&#x2019;s perception of safety
  and fear of crime. However, the scale and methods of administration vary. Many
  of these surveys contain the question needed to compute indicator 16.1.4.
  (&#x2018;How safe do you feel walking alone in your area/neighbourhood at
  night?&#x2019;). This suggests that data on this indicator will become more
  widely available over the next few years.</p>

  <p>Recommended disaggregation for this indicator:</p>

  <p>- age</p>

  <p>- sex</p>

  <p>- disability status</p>

  <p>- ethnicity</p>

  <p>- migration background</p>

  <p>- citizenship</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
