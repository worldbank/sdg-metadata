  <p><u>Sustainability Reports</u>: </p>

  <p>For the purposes of this indicator, &#x2018;sustainability reports&#x2019;
  will not be limited to stand-alone sustainability reports produced by
  companies, but will be considered as &#x2018;reporting sustainability
  information&#x2019; and expanded to other forms of reporting sustainability
  information, such as publishing sustainability information as part of the
  company&#x2019;s annual reports or reporting sustainability information to the
  national government. This is to ensure that the focus of the indicator is on
  tracking the publishing of sustainability information, rather than on the
  practice of publishing stand-alone sustainability reports. It also ensures
  that the indicator interpretation is aligned with the wording of Target 12.6
  which refers to promoting &#x201C;the integration of sustainability
  information into the annual reporting cycle of companies&#x201D;. </p>

  <p><u>Company:</u></p>

  <p>While many companies report at the group level, many of their impacts will
  be local, and some subsidiaries or franchises produce separate sustainability
  reports. As a practice that should be encouraged, and one that is useful to
  monitor, it is therefore proposed to count both the group and
  subsidiary/franchise level separately, as separate entities.
  &#x201C;Company&#x201D; can therefore apply to either the parent company, or a
  franchise or subsidiary, depending on their reporting practices.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>It is proposed that, to be counted towards the indicator, companies are
  encouraged to publish information that meets a &#x201C;Minimum
  requirement&#x201D; of disclosure. A core set of economic, environmental,
  social and governance disclosures of sustainability information is therefore
  identified. In defining these disclosure elements, the custodian agencies
  attempted to align with the disclosures that appear in existing related
  reporting frameworks, including the International Integrated Reporting Council
  (IIRC) reporting framework, the Global Reporting Initiative Standard (GRI),
  the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) (see Annex I for a
  comparison of the various sustainability disclosures contained under each.</p>

  <p>It also attempts to align with the UNCTAD Core Indicators for company
  reporting on the contribution towards the attainment of the Sustainable
  Development Goals. UNCTAD has prepared Guidance on Core indicators for entity
  reporting on the contribution towards the attainment of the Sustainable
  Development Goals (SDGs) to support entities in the provision of information
  under indicator 12.6.1 and governments in assessing the private sector
  contribution to the SDGs. The Guidance reflects the Agreed Conclusions of the
  thirty-fourth session of the Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on
  International Standards of Accounting and Reporting (ISAR), which in 2017
  requested UNCTAD to develop the guiding document. The UNCTAD Guidance includes
  detailed definitions and data sources for the core indicators in the company
  accounts to assist the entities in the reporting.</p>

  <p>The purpose is not to create a new reporting standard or framework, but to
  ensure that the minimum reporting recommendations for Indicator 12.6.1 are
  aligned with existing global frameworks currently used by companies, so that
  they may continue to use these frameworks.</p>

  <p>While establishing a minimum recommendations in terms of reporting enables
  companies disclosing meaningful information on all aspects of sustainability
  to be counted towards the indicator, it could be perceived as giving the
  message that the minimum suffices and that companies do not need to go beyond
  it. </p>

  <p>Therefore, it is proposed that the methodology include an advanced level,
  with a further set of disclosure elements, which would further provide impetus
  for examining and reporting on the sustainability practices and impacts of the
  company. These include: 1) stakeholder engagement, 2) assessing impacts beyond
  the company boundaries and along the supply chain; 3) supplier and consumer
  engagement on sustainability issues; 4) procurement and sourcing practices;
  and 5) environmental performance information in the form of intensity values
  to be monitored over time, such as consumption of energy, water or materials
  per unit of production or per unit of profit.</p>

  <p>Having different levels will also allow for information to be collected on
  the degree of reporting of different companies, including whether the same
  companies produce more ambitious reports, and go further in their
  sustainability practices with time, such as through supplier engagement. It
  would allow for companies who are beginning to produce sustainability reports
  to provide incentive, through their inclusion in the indicator count, for them
  to work towards more ambitious reporting and demonstrate their progress over
  time.</p>

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>While the private sector has a critical role to play in the attainment of
  the SDGs, Target 12.6 and Indicator 12.6.1 are the only ones specifically
  monitoring the practices of private sector entities. While Indicator 12.6.1
  counts the number of companies producing &#x201C;sustainability
  reports&#x201D;, the custodian agencies consider the indicator an important
  opportunity not only to monitor and promote the growth in sustainability
  reporting globally, but also to monitor and promote high quality reporting,
  promote the integration of sustainability information into the annual
  reporting cycle of companies, and promote sustainability practices by
  companies (as mentioned in the Target under which the indicator falls).
  Attempts have therefore been made to integrate all of these aspects into the
  methodology, to the extent possible to encourage companies to advance the
  quality of sustainability reporting by disclosing baseline indicators across
  economic, environmental, social and institutional dimensions (for more
  details, please consult Minimum and Advanced recommendations below)</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The indicator is limited by the number of reports published on ESG rating
  platforms and collected by global report aggregators.</p>

  could be some reports that cannot be captured for this reason.</p>

  <p>The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and United

IMPUTATION: >-
  <p>No treatment of missing values is done at country level and at regional

COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>Data on number of companies reports are available for all member states
  that have companies publishing sustainability information, as defined by the
  indicator. </p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>The reporting on this indicator is annual, given that most companies
  publish sustainability information on an annual basis.</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>The platform will generate the following information for each country, then
  aggregate per sub-region, region and globally (avoiding double-counting of
  companies during the aggregation): </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Total number of companies publishing reports that:</strong></li>
    <li>Meet the minimum reporting recommendations </li>
    <li>Meet the advanced level reporting recommendations</li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Inclusion of a company under a specific country</strong></li>
  </ol>

  <p>It is proposed that:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Multi-national companies are included in the country in which they are listed, or in the country where the head office is found. </li>
    <li>When a multinational company produces specific separate reports, with disaggregated information per country, for the different countries they operate in, these would be counted separately under the indicator count for each country.</li>
    <li><strong>Data disaggregated per company size</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Company sizes are currently defined differently in different jurisdictions.
  For Indicator 12.6.1, a simple split of &#x2018;large&#x2019; and
  &#x2018;small&#x2019; could be proposed, with large being more than 250
  employees, and small and medium being less than 250 employees. This is in line
  with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), UN Global Compact definitions, and
  is the most frequent definition at the national level in terms of employee
  number. No minimum turnover requirement is prescribed due to the wide
  variation in turnover of companies of this size between countries. </p>

  <p>This is the definition of a company size that will be used by the custodian
  agencies for aggregation and comparability of data and analysis of trends at
  sub-regional, regional and global levels. </p>

    <li><strong>Data disaggregated per sector</strong></li>
