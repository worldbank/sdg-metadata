  <p><strong>Definition: </strong></p>

  <p>The precise definition of the indicator is the Proportion of domestic
  budgetary central government expenditure funded by taxes. Budgetary central
  government, described in GFSM 2014 (paragraph 2.81) is an institutional unit
  of the general government sector particularly important in terms of size and
  power, particularly the power to exercise control over many other units and
  entities. The budgetary central government is often a single unit of the
  central government that encompasses the fundamental activities of the national
  executive, legislative, and judiciary powers. This component of general
  government is usually covered by the main (or general) budget. The budgetary
  central government&#x2019;s revenue (and expense) are normally regulated and
  controlled by a ministry of finance, or its functional equivalent, by means of
  a budget approved by the legislature. Most of the ministries, departments,
  agencies, boards, commissions, judicial authorities, legislative bodies, and
  other entities that make up the budgetary central government are not separate
  institutional units. This is because they generally do not have the authority
  to own assets, incur liabilities, or engage in transactions in their own right
  (see GFSM 2014 paragraph 2.42). including references to standards and
  classifications, preferably relying on international agreed definitions. The
  indicator definition should be unambiguous and expressed in universally
  applicable terms. It must clearly express the unit of measurement (proportion,
  dollars, number of people, etc.).</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>The key concepts and terms associated with the indicator are outlined in
  GFSM 2014, as are the associated classifications. Revenue is defined in
  Chapter 4 (paragraph 4.23) and the associated classifications are detailed in
  Chapter 5. Expenditure is also defined in Chapter 4 (paragraph 4.21) while the
  associated detailed classifications and concepts used for calculating this
  aggregate are outlined in Chapter 6 - 8.</p>
UNIT_MEASURE: <p>Proportion</p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: <p>See 2.a.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The actual and recommended sources of data for deriving this indicator are
  the fiscal statistics reported to the IMF&#x2019;s Statistics Department.
  These come from various agencies (Ministries of Finance, Central Banks,
  National Statistics Offices, etc.) and are compiled according to a
  standardized method for data collection: the annual GFS Questionnaire. In the
  2020 annual reporting cycle, approximately 130 countries reported the relevant
  series for monitoring indicator 17.1.2. For current non-reporting countries
  that have demonstrated the capacity to compile and report the relevant GFS
  revenue series, we are engaged in outreach to the national authorities, in
  consultation with the respective IMF Area Departments and Offices of the
  Executive Director, as needed. The steps outlined above should allow, over
  time, for covering virtually the entire IMF membership.</p>
COLL_METHOD: <p>See 3.a. </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>Dates when source collection is next planned: IMF Statistics Department
  completed the 2020 round of annual GFS collection in February 2021. The 2021
  collection cycle is planned to take place between September and December
  2021.</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>Country data are disseminated as they are processed and summary World
  Tables and other indicators, including 17.1.2 are planned for release in early
  2021. For most countries, the reference year will be their Fiscal Year 2019
  series, as well as five or more most recent years.</p>
DATA_SOURCE: <p>See 3.a.</p>
COMPILING_ORG: >-
  <p>The IMF Statistics Department (Government Finance Division) is the
  organization responsible for the compilation and reporting on this indicator
  at the global level.</p>
INST_MANDATE: <p>See 3.a.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Indicator 17.1.2 Proportion of domestic budgetary central government
  expenditure funded by taxes supports an understanding of the extent to which
  countries&#x2019; recurrent and capital outlays are actually covered by
  domestic revenue mobilization in the form of taxation. The indicator, which
  can be directly derived from GFS series reported by national authorities to
  the IMF Statistics Department, will provide analysts with a cross-country
  comparable dataset that highlights the relationship between the executed
  national budget and the revenue/tax administration As outlined in the Annex to
  Chapter 4 of GFSM 2014, a variety of indicators can be observed or derived
  directly from the GFS framework, while others can be derived using a
  combination of GFS with other macroeconomic data (i.e., GDP). 17.1.2 will be
  derived using series that are basic to the GFS reporting framework. This
  enhances the comparability of data across countries and ensures establishing
  robust analytical findings to support SDG monitoring using fiscal data. There
  are also complementarities with Indicator 17.1.1, which facilitates an
  understanding of the &quot;tax burden&quot;. Both indicators are important in
  relation to achieving longer-term development objectives.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>At this time the IMF recommends no regional and global aggregates be
  established. While we see no issues in terms of the feasibility and
  suitability of 17.1.2 for cross-country comparisons, we question the relevance
  of one single global indicator that combines data for advanced economies with
  those of emerging market and low income countries. </p>

  <p>For reporting this indicator, budgetary central government is considered
  the most appropriate level of institutional coverage as it will encompass all
  countries. In principle, GFS should cover all entities that materially affect
  fiscal policies. However, for most developing and many emerging market
  economies compiling data for the consolidated general government and its
  subsectors is problematic owing to limitations in the availability and/or
  timeliness of source data. A country may have one central government; several
  state, provincial, or regional governments; and many local governments, and
  the GFSM 2014 recommends that statistics should be compiled for all such
  general government units. This reporting structure is illustrated below:</p>

  <p>There are some countries that report &#x201C;consolidated central
  government&#x201D; without necessarily providing the budgetary central
  government subsector separately. The IMF intends to provide data for the
  budgetary central government and will work to address this issue, where
  needed, as outlined under section 5, above.</p>

  of nonfinancial assets&#x201D;, as defined in <em>GFSM 2014</em>). GFS
  Expenditure series are reported by the economic classification in Tables 2,

  total expenditure according to the functional classification (COFOG) in GFS
  Table 7, a similar calculation can be made. The <em>Proportion of domestic

  <p>Consistency across countries will be ensured through the underlying
  structure of the IMF GFS database and application of one simple mathematical
  formulas to make computations on the country reported source data used to
  produce the indicator (no adjustments and/or weighting techniques will be
  applied). Mixed sources are not being used nor will the calculation change
  over time (i.e., there are no discontinuities in the underlying series as
  these are key aggregates/ components in all country reported GFS series).</p>

IMPUTATION: >-
  <p>The IMF plans to rely exclusively on officially reported data provided by
  the national authorities using the standard GFS questionnaire based on GFSM
  2014 methodology. When country data are not available due to a lack of
  reporting to the IMF Statistics Department, we plan to engage in outreach to
  the national authorities, in consultation with the respective IMF Area
  Departments and Offices of the Executive Director, as needed, to ensure that
  the key GFS series are reported. No country data estimates for missing values
  will be calculated by the IMF Statistics Department.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>The IMF Statistics Department will leverage the existing GFS database to
  provide cross-country comparable series in a standardized presentation format.
  We would appreciate further discussion with the IAEG SDGs on the merits of
  deriving regional or global aggregates from the country reported values for
  this indicator. </p>

  <p>Classification of the indicator into one of the following three tiers:</p>

  <p>We recommend that 17.1.2 remain classified as Tier 1: The indicator is
  conceptually clear and standards are available. The underlying data are
  regularly produced by countries, and there is current data available. From the
  IAEG-SDGs Tier Classification description at
  https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/tier-classification/, a key criteria is
  that &#x201C;data are regularly produced by countries for at least 50 per cent
  of countries&#x201D;. The IMF GFS database, with 130+ regular annual reporting
  countries using the same reporting format certainly meets this key criteria.
  All IMF member countries produce revenue (and expenditure) data for
  surveillance purposes. In recent rounds of soliciting annual GFS series from
  countries, we have specifically encouraged those countries that were
  non-reporters over the past few years to (at a minimum) provide the key
  revenue and expenditure series needed to monitor 17.1.</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>General government units have four types of revenue: (i) compulsory levies
  in the form of taxes and certain types of social contributions; (ii) property
  income derived from the ownership of assets; (iii) sales of goods and
  services; and (iv) other transfers receivable from other units. Of these,
  compulsory levies and transfers are considered the main sources of revenue for
  most general government units (GFSM 2014 paragraph 5.1). These four types of
  revenue are represented by the following aggregates: Taxes, Social
  contributions, Grants, Other revenue. Similarly, the economic classification
  of expense identifies eight types of expense incurred according to the
  economic process involved. For example, compensation of employees, use of
  goods and services, and consumption of fixed capital all relate to the costs
  of producing nonmarket (and, in certain instances, market) goods and services
  by government. Subsidies, grants, social benefits, and transfers other than
  grants relate to transfers in cash or in kind, and are aimed at redistributing
  income and wealth. The functional classification of expense provides
  information on the purpose for which an expense was incurred. Examples of
  functions are education, health, and environmental protection. The detailed
  GFS classification structure used in the annual questionnaire that is used by
  countries to report data allows for sufficient disaggregation for compiling
  17.1.2.</p>
