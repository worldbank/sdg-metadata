  <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator includes hazardous generated, hazardous waste generated by
  type (including e-waste as a sub-indicator) and the proportion of hazardous
  waste treated. </p>

  <p><strong>Hazardous waste </strong>is waste with properties capable of having
  a harmful effect on human health or the environment and is regulated and
  controlled by law.</p>

  <p><strong>Hazardous waste generated</strong>: refers to the quantity of
  hazardous waste generated within the country during the reported year, prior
  to any activity such as collection, preparation for reuse, treatment,
  recovery, including recycling, or export, no matter the destination of this
  waste.</p>

  <p><strong>Hazardous waste generated by type, including e-waste</strong>: A
  breakdown of hazardous waste generated by key type of waste, including
  e-waste.</p>

  <p><strong>Municipal waste: Municipal solid waste (MSW) </strong>includes
  waste originating from households, commerce and trade, small businesses,
  office buildings and institutions (schools, hospitals, government buildings).
  It also includes bulky waste (e.g., old furniture, mattresses) and waste from
  selected municipal services, e.g. waste from parks and gardens maintenance,
  waste from street cleaning services (street sweepings, litter containers
  content, market cleansing waste), if managed as waste.</p>

  <p><strong>E-waste:</strong> Electronic waste, or e-waste, refers to all items
  of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) and its parts that have been
  discarded by its owner as waste without the intent of re-use.</p>

  <p><strong>Hazardous waste treated</strong>: Hazardous waste treated during
  reporting year, per each type of treatment (recycling, incineration
  with/without energy recovery, landfilling or other), including exports and
  excluding imports.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p><em>Hazardous waste</em> is waste with properties that make it hazardous or
  capable of having a harmful effect on human health or the environment.
  Hazardous waste is generated from many sources, ranging from industrial
  manufacturing process waste to domestic items such as batteries and may come
  in many forms, including liquids, solids, gases and sludge. They can be
  discarded as commercial products, like cleaning fluids or pesticides or the
  by-products of manufacturing processes, from Basel Convention (Article 1,
  paragraph 1(a)). Waste listed in Annex VIII of the Basel Convention is
  presumed to be hazardous, while waste listed in Annex IX is presumed not to be
  hazardous. For the purpose of this indicator, due to comparability reasons,
  additional waste considered hazardous as per national definitions, as provided
  by the Basel Convention under Article 1, paragraph 1(b), are excluded.</p>

  <p><em>Hazardous waste generated</em> refers to the quantity of hazardous
  waste (as per the definition above) that is generated within the country
  during the reported year, prior to any activity such as collection,
  preparation for reuse, treatment, recovery, including recycling, or export, no
  matter the destination of this waste. For waste that are not covered under the
  above definition, but are defined as, or are considered to be hazardous waste
  by national definitions and are included in the &#x201C;hazardous waste
  generated&#x201D; amount, a specific note should be added specifying the
  additional types/streams of hazardous waste included as well as their
  quantities.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>&#x201C;<em>Waste treated</em>&#x201D; and &#x201C;<em>type of
  treatment</em>&#x201D; are not defined in the Basel Convention. In this
  context, &#x201C;treatment&#x201D; will include all operations included under
  Annex IV of the Basel Convention, namely &#x201C;Disposal&#x201D; operations
  D1 to D15 and &#x201C;Recovery&#x201D; operations R1 to R13. This is also
  linked to the definitions of &#x201C;Recycling, Incineration, Incineration
  with energy recovery, Landfilling and other types of treatment or
  disposal&#x201D;.</p>

  categories of economic activities and by households. The economic activities
  included in the scope of hazardous waste are disaggregated by ISIC, Rev.4:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Agriculture, forestry and fishing (ISIC 01-03)</li>
    <li>Mining and quarrying (ISIC 05-09)</li>

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Chemicals are part of everyday life. There are over 140,000 different
  substances used in all economic sectors globally. Their benefits are many and
  so too are their potential to adversely impact human health and the
  environment if not properly managed. All countries, especially middle- and
  low-income countries, are facing the complex challenge of managing hazardous
  waste according to international standards of good practice. The situation is
  complicated by limited human, financial and/or technical resources. As such,
  action is needed to support the sustainable use of chemicals and
  environmentally sound management of hazardous waste. There is also a rapid
  increase in the generation of hazardous waste. Where most of the conventional
  hazardous wastes are produced in industrial and manufacturing operations,
  significant amounts are generated in non-industrial sectors, including sludge
  from the healthcare sector; waste-water treatment plants, waste oils, and
  waste batteries. There is also an increase in the complexity of products and
  unidentified hazardous components like coatings, and/or items which are not
  hazardous (laminates and multi-layer packaging), but present hazardousness in
  a variety of ways when improperly discarded and end up in air, water or are
  burned.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Data on hazardous waste generation and treatment may be scarce in some
  countries, due to a series of factors, such as lack of, or insufficient,
  policies and regulations on management and/or reporting; limited human,
  financial and technical resources within government agencies, lack of clear
  disclosure and reporting rules and requirements, and unwillingness of
  generators and public officials in certain countries to disclose the
  quantities of hazardous waste generated. Some countries may have the data and
  monitoring systems needed to report, while for others there is a need for
  training and capacity development to enhance data collection, validation and
  reporting capacity. </p>

  <p>Limitations in terms of usable data for calculating the indicator(s) may
  arise due to differences in understanding of the terminology used in the
  indicator or differences between these definitions and those included in
  national legislation. This can lead to differences in reported values and
  difficulties in cross-checking of reported data. For example, by national
  legislation, countries may define additional types of waste to be considered
  as hazardous beyond the waste streams defined in the Basel Convention.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>A full methodology for this indicator is available in the document
  entitled, &#x201C;<a
  href="https://www.unep.org/resources/publication/global-chemicals-and-waste-indicator-review-document#:~:text=The%20Global%20Chemicals%20and%20Waste,related%20SDG%20indicators%20across%20sectors.">Global
  Chemicals and Waste Indicator Review Document</a>&#x201D; (UNEP, 2021).</p>

  <p>For the purpose of this indicator, Hazardous waste generated should include
  collected hazardous waste (either by specialized companies or by municipal
  services), hazardous waste which is given by the generator directly to the
  treatment or disposal facility, as well as an estimation of the hazardous
  waste which is unaccounted for. Generated hazardous waste includes exported
  hazardous waste and excludes imports of hazardous waste.</p>

  <p>The estimation of hazardous waste unaccounted for is the most difficult
  aspect of this methodology as it requires local-level knowledge and
  estimation. This aspect of the indicator is particularly important as
  hazardous waste that is unaccounted for is typically also untreated and has a
  high potential to impact the environment.</p>

  <p>The proportion of hazardous waste treated is presented below. Note that the
  total quantity of hazardous waste treated during the reported year in the
  reporting country is calculated by adding quantities of hazardous waste
  treated, per type of treatment (recycling, incineration with/without energy
  recovery, landfilling or other), including exports and excluding imports. This
  matches with the definition of recycling in SDG indicator 12.5.1.</p>

DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>The United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) carries out extensive data
  validation procedures that include built-in automated procedures, manual
  checks and cross-references to national sources of data. Communication is
  carried out with countries for clarification and validation of data. Only data
  that are considered accurate or those confirmed by countries during the
  validation process are included in UNSD&#x2019;s environment statistics
  database and disseminated on its website.</p>

  <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and
  Eurostat carry out extensive data validation procedures on the biennial
  OECD/Eurostat Joint Questionnaire on the State of the Environment.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: <p>Not applicable</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p>The United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), which conducts the data
  collection, validation and dissemination process via the UNSD/UNEP
  Questionnaire on Environment Statistics, does not make any estimation or
  imputation for missing values, so the number of data points provided are
  actual country data. However, UNEP is considering the possibility of global
  modelling. </p>

  <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and
  Eurostat also do not make any estimation or imputation for missing values.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>The data will be aggregated at the sub-regional, regional and global
  levels. For the aggregation methods, please see: <a
  href="http://wesr.unep.org/media/docs/graphs/aggregation_methods.pdf">http://wesr.unep.org/media/docs/graphs/aggregation_methods.pdf</a>.

COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>For national data: All countries that reply to the questionnaire.</p>

  <p>For global estimates: Regional and global level. </p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p> For national data: The data sets presented in the SDG database cover a
  period since 2000 if countries report them.</p>

  <p>For global estimates: The data sets presented in the SDG database cover a
  period since 2000.</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation: </strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Disaggregation by ISIC codes. Information on the generation and treatment of hazardous waste could be collected from industry or municipal level and treatment/disposal facilities. </li>
    <li>Disaggregation by type of landfilling. As there is a significant difference between landfilling in controlled and uncontrolled landfills, further disaggregation on this type of treatment could be analysed.</li>
    <li>Disaggregation by type of treatment per generating sector. </li>
    <li>Disaggregation by type of recycling operation (R2 to R12 from Basel convention Annex IV).</li>
    <li>Disaggregation by territorial division. Information on the hazardous waste generated can significantly vary throughout the territory of a country as there might be hotspots of hazardous waste generation, concentrated around industry intensive areas. </li>
  </ul>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>As mentioned, waste statistics involve a large number of national and
  sub-national stakeholders which may create discrepancies. To address these
  possible discrepancies, inter-institutional stakeholder collaboration is
  always encouraged.</p>
