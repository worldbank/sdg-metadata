  <p>Annual gross receipts by developing countries of: a. Official sustainable
  development grants, b. Official concessional sustainable development loans, c.
  Official non-concessional sustainable development loans, d. Foreign direct
  investment, e. Mobilised private finance (MPF) on an experimental basis, and
  f. Private grants.</p>

  <p>a. Official sustainable development grants</p>

  <p>Grants are transfers in cash or in kind for which no legal debt is incurred
  by the recipient.</p>

  <p>b. Official concessional sustainable development loans</p>

  <p>Loans are transfers in cash or in kind for which the recipient incurs legal
  debt. A concessional transfer is one which gives something of value away. For
  the purposes of this indicator, a loan will be regarded as concessional if it
  embodies at least a 35% grant element when its service payments are discounted
  at 5% p.a. This test is derived from the World Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability
  Framework for Low Income Countries and has also been adopted by the TOSSD Task
  Force.</p>

  <p>c. Official non-concessional sustainable development loans</p>

  <p>These are loans (see above) which bear a grant element of less than 35%
  when their service payments are discounted at 5% p.a.</p>

  <p>d. Foreign direct investment</p>

  <p>Foreign direct investment (FDI) is a category of investment that reflects
  the objective of establishing a lasting interest by a resident enterprise in
  one economy (direct investor) in an enterprise (direct investment enterprise)
  that is resident in an economy other than that of the direct investor. The
  lasting interest implies the existence of a long-term relationship between the
  direct investor and the direct investment enterprise and a significant degree
  of influence on the management of the enterprise. The direct or indirect
  ownership of 10% or more of the voting power of an enterprise resident in one
  economy by an investor resident in another economy is taken as evidence of
  such a relationship. For OECD Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct
  Investment - 4th Edition and UNCTAD work on Foreign Direct Investment

  <p>e. Mobilised private finance (MPF) on an experimental basis</p>

  <p>Mobilised private finance (MPF) consists of private resource flows for
  activities in developing countries which have been mobilised by interventions
  of multilateral development banks (MDBs), bilateral development finance
  institutions, or other bilateral agencies, i.e. where a direct causal link
  between the official intervention and the private resources can be
  demonstrated. The OECD method for counting MPF is used; see <a
  href="https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/mobilisation.htm">https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/mobilisation.htm</a>.
  MPF is a &#x201C;memorandum item&#x201D; because it would likely include and
  overlap with some finance that would also be found in the FDI sub-indicator.
  MPF data are typically collected on a commitment basis, rather than in terms
  of developing country receipts. This indicator excludes private flows
  mobilised in recipient countries themselves as they do not constitute
  additional resources. The indicator is included on an experimental basis, and
  it is recommended that it be reviewed during the 2025 review of SDG
  indicators.</p>

  <p>f. Private grants</p>

  <p>Private grants are here taken to mean grants for developmental purposes
  from private institutions outside the recipient country, excluding commercial
  flows and personal transactions such as remittances. They essentially comprise
  grants from philanthropic foundations and other non-governmental
  organizations.</p>

  <p>Sustainable development criteria</p>

  <p>Based on the Group&#x2019;s discussions, and building on the work of the
  TOSSD Task Force, the following cascading approach will be used to identify
  flows that can be considered as supporting sustainable development:</p>

  <p>1. Flows within the proposed indicators and sub-indicators detailed below
  and identified individually, such as a specific activity in provider reporting
  systems, should be included if they directly support either (i) at least one
  of the SDG targets or (ii) an objective in the recipient country&#x2019;s
  development plan as long as this is directed towards supporting or achieving
  sustainable development, with the following exceptions:</p>

  <p>a. Flows for activities where a substantial detrimental effect is
  anticipated on one or more of the other targets. </p>

  <p>b. Flows where the recipient country, after discussion with the custodian
  agency and/or the reporting provider country, objects to their
  characterization as supporting its sustainable development. </p>

  <p>2. Flows, or portions of flows within the proposed indicators and
  sub-indicators detailed below for which data are only available at the
  aggregate country-to-country level are also considered as supporting
  sustainable development, subject to the same exceptions as under 1.a and
  1.b.</p>

  <p>Note that some sub-indicators may contain a mixture of activity-specific
  and aggregate-level flow data and therefore require assessment against 1 and 2
  respectively. Also note that further specific exclusions are proposed, as
  detailed below, that may in some cases be considered to reinforce the focus of
  the proposed indicators on the sustainable development of developing
  countries.</p>

  <p>The indicator measures additional financial resources for developing
  countries from multiple sources. It fully complies with the Addis Ababa Action
  Agenda by distinguishing flows of different nature and concessionality that
  have different impacts on development, thus creating transparency. It follows
  the recipient perspective, and all data represent new financing flows to
  developing countries. It builds on existing work, in particular standard OECD
  and UNCTAD data collections and the work of the TOSSD Task Force on its
  measurement of Total Official Support for Sustainable Development (TOSSD). It
  is underpinned by an initial conceptual framework on South-South cooperation,
  allowing reporting by countries that practice South-South cooperation.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The indicator is feasible, suitable and relevant. </p>

  <p>Some providers will be reporting on sub-indicators 17.3.1.a, 17.3.1.b and
  17.3.1.c to OECD while some providers will report on these sub-indicators to
  UNCTAD according to the agreed conceptual framework on South-South cooperation
  developed by the sub-Group on South-South cooperation. </p>

  <p>Sub-indicator 17.3.1.d (FDI) is reported to UNCTAD by recipients according
  to the current reporting arrangements. </p>

  <p>Some multilateral and bilateral providers are reporting on sub-indicator
  17.3.1.e mobilized private finance to OECD. Mobilized private finance is not
  part of the conceptual framework of South-South cooperation. Some providers
  that are engaging in this form of development finance may approach UNCTAD
  regarding the pilot testing and further development of this indicator for
  wider and global application. </p>

  <p>Some countries will report on 17.3.1.f to OECD. Private grants are not part
  of the conceptual framework of South-South cooperation. Some providers can
  report on private grants to UNCTAD on a voluntary basis as part of a pilot
  exercise.</p>

  <p>UNCTAD and OECD as co-custodians have undertaken to ensure that there are
  no overlaps in global reporting for this indicator in cases where countries or
  multilaterals provide their information to both organizations. </p>

  <p>The indicator does not include debt relief, in-donor refugee costs,
  administrative costs not allocated to specific development activities, or
  peace and security expenditures other than those reportable as official
  development assistance (ODA). Furthermore, it does not include private
  non-concessional loans; portfolio investment; export credits, whether
  official, officially-supported, or private; short-term flows with an original
  maturity of 1 year or less; or any other flows that are not within the scope
  of the proposed sub-indicators. These exclusions sharpen the focus of the
  indicator on transfers of new resources to developing countries for
  sustainable development purposes, while excluding commercially-motivated
  debt-creating flows. While there was broad support for all exclusions during
  the discussions of the Working Group and the open consultation, and while
  there were relatively few objections to specific exclusions, some countries
  nevertheless believe that all exclusions should be reviewed in the context of
  the 2025 review.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>While the sub-indicators follow the recipient perspective, the data for all
  proposed sub-indicators except foreign direct investment are reportable by the
  providers and subsequently aggregated by recipient. Foreign direct investment
  is as reported by recipients.</p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>Extensive validation and quality assurance procedures are in place and
  being further developed at OECD and UNCTAD. Flows where the recipient country,
  after discussion with the custodian agency and/or the reporting provider
  country, objects to their characterization as supporting its sustainable
  development may be excluded. The custodian agencies are requested to establish
  mechanisms for validation based on the sustainable development criteria
  applied for this indicator which will adequately support concerns of the
  recipient countries.</p>

  <p>Existing databases established at the OECD and UNCTAD will serve as a data
  source. At the OECD, this includes data collected through TOSSD reporting as
  well as traditional OECD-DAC-CRS reporting, assuming the data will be adjusted
  in accordance with the requirements of this proposal. Pilot exercises are
  being conducted or are being planned. In its pilot data collection, the OECD
  was able to provide data as applicable for sub-indicators a, b, c, e and f for
  140 countries covering all recipient countries across all regions. At the
  UNCTAD, existing databases include data on foreign direct investment. Multiple
  countries practicing South-South cooperation agreed to the conduct of pilot
  studies while UNCTAD is committed to support others in their reporting.</p>

  <p>Mobilized private finance should cover and be disaggregated by flows
  originating in (i) high-income, (ii) low- and middle and (iii)
  multiple/unknown countries but should exclude flows known to be mobilized in
  recipient countries.</p>

  <p>The following countries have submitted their data for sub-indicators
  17.3.1a, 17.3.1b, 17.3.1c, 17.3.1e and 17.3.1f: Australia, Austria, Belgium,
  Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary,
  Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania,
  Malta, Monaco, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovak
  Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United
  States. Please note that all countries provide support in the form of official
  sustainable development grants, but only a few provide support in all the
  mentioned categories. In addition, the data includes multilateral providers.
  Data gaps linked to providers reporting to the OECD DAC (Creditor Reporting
  System) but not to TOSSD have been estimated (i.e. for Czech Republic, the
  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Germany, the IMF
  concessional trust funds, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the World Bank).</p>
