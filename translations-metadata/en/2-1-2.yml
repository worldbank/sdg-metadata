  <p>Definition:</p>

  <p>The indicator measures the percentage of individuals in the population who
  have experienced food insecurity at moderate or severe levels during the
  reference period. The severity of food insecurity, defined as a latent trait,
  is measured on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale global reference scale, a
  measurement standard established by FAO through the application of the Food
  Insecurity Experience Scale in more than 140 countries worldwide, starting in
  2014.</p>

  <p>Concepts:</p>

  <p>Extensive research over more than 25 years has demonstrated that the
  inability to access food results in a series of experiences and conditions
  that are fairly common across cultures and socio-economic contexts and that
  range from being concerned about the ability to obtain enough food, to the
  need to compromise on the quality or the diversity of food consumed, to being
  forced to reduce the intake of food by cutting portion sizes or skipping
  meals, up to the extreme condition of feeling hungry and not having means to
  access any food for a whole day. Typical conditions like these form the basis
  of an experience-based food insecurity measurement scale. When analysed
  through sound statistical methods rooted in Item Response Theory, data
  collected through such scales provide the basis to compute theoretically
  consistent, cross country comparable measures of the prevalence of food
  insecurity. The severity of the food insecurity condition as measured by this
  indicator thus directly reflects the extent of households&#x2019; or
  individuals&#x2019; inability to regularly access the food they need.</p>
UNIT_MEASURE: >-
  <p>The unit of the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity is
  percentage of the total population. A related indicator, the number of food
  insecure people, is measured as millions of people. </p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>The construction of the regional and global estimates, as well as estimates
  for specific groups, such as Least Developed Countries, Land Locked Developing
  countries, Small Island Developing States, Developed Regions, and Developing
  Regions, of this indicator follows the UN M49 Standard.</p>

  <p>Data sources and collection process</p>

  <p>Data can be collected using the Food Insecurity Experience Scale survey
  module (FIES-SM) developed by FAO, or any other experience-based food security
  scale questionnaires, including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM) developed by the Economic Research Service of the US Department of Agriculture, and used in the US and Canada, </li>
    <li>the Latin American and Caribbean Food Security Scale (or Escala Latinoamericana y Caribe&#xF1;a de Seguridad Alimentaria &#x2013; ELCSA), used in Guatemala and tested in several other Spanish speaking countries in Latin America, </li>
    <li>the Mexican Food Security Scale (or Escala Mexicana de Seguridad Alimentaria, - EMSA), an adaptation of the ELCSA used in Mexico, </li>
    <li>the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale (Escala Brasileira de medida de la Inseguran&#xE7;a Alimentar &#x2013; EBIA) used in Brazil, or </li>
    <li>the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS), </li>
  </ul>

  <p>or any adaptation of the above that can be calibrated against the global
  FIES.</p>

  <p>Two versions of the FIES-SM are available for use in surveys of individuals
  or households respectively, and the difference stands in whether respondents
  are asked to report only on their individual experiences, or also on that of
  other member of the household.</p>

  <p>The current FIES-SM module include eight questions as in the table below.

  <p>The questions should be adapted and administered in the respondents&#x2019;
  preferred language and enumerators instructed to make sure that respondents
  recognize the reference period and the qualifier according to which
  experiences should be reported only when due to &#x201C;lack of money or other
  resources&#x201D; and not, for example, for reasons related to health or other
  cultural habits (such as fasting for religious credos).</p>

  <p>The FIES-SM can be included in virtually any telephone-based or personal
  interview based survey of the population, though face to face interview is
  preferred. </p>

  <p>Since 2014, the individual referenced FIES-SM is applied to nationally
  representative samples of the population aged 15 or more in all countries
  covered by the Gallup World Poll (more than 140 countries every year, covering
  90% of the world population). In most countries samples include about 1000
  individuals (with larger samples of 3000 individuals in India and 5000 in
  mainland China).</p>

  <p>Other national surveys exist that already collect FIES compatible data.

  <p>In Burkina Faso, the FIES was included in the 2014 round of ENQUETE
  MULTISECTORIELLE CONTINUE (EMC-BF).</p>

  Monitoring of the Palestinian Households&#x2019; Survey.</p>

  <p>In the Republic of Korea, the Korean translation of the HFSSM was included
  in the 2014 and 2015 rounds of the Korea National Health and Nutrition
  Examination Survey (KNHANES).</p>

  <p>In the Russian Federation, FIES was collected in the 2018 round of

  Survey.</p>

  <p>In the United States, the HFSSM is included every year in the Current
  Population Survey Food Security Supplement (CPS-FSS) by the US Bureau of
  Census since 1995. (The CPS-FSS reached about 83,000 individuals aged 15 or
  more in about 42,000 households in 2014.)</p>

  <p><u>Obtaining internationally comparable data for global monitoring:</u></p>

  <p>To ensure comparability of the FImod+sev and FIsev indicators computed for
  different populations, universal thresholds are defined on the FIES global
  reference scale and converted into corresponding values on the
  &#x201C;local&#x201D; scales obtained as a result of application of the Rasch
  model on any specific population, through a process of
  &#x201C;equating&#x201D;.</p>

  <p>Equating is a form of standardization of the metric based on identification
  of the subset of items that can be considered common to the global FIES and
  the specific scale used for measurement in each context. The severity levels
  associated with the common items are used as anchoring points to adjust the
  global FIES thresholds to the local scales. The standardization process
  ensures that the mean and standard deviation of the set of common items is the
  same when measured on the global FIES or on the national scale. Compatibility
  with the global FIES and the possibility to compile this indicator requires
  that at least four of the eight FIES items are identified as common.</p>

  <p>The Statistics Division at FAO has developed the RM.weights package under
  R, which provides routines for estimating the parameters of the Rasch model
  using conditional maximum likelihood, with the possibility to allow for the
  complex survey design.</p>

OTHER_METHOD: ''
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Food insecurity at moderate levels of severity is typically associated with
  the inability to regularly eat healthy, balanced diets. As such, high
  prevalence of food insecurity at moderate levels can be considered a predictor
  of various forms of diet-related health conditions in the population,
  associated with micronutrient deficiency and unbalanced diets. Severe levels
  of food insecurity, on the other hand, imply a high probability of reduced
  food intake and therefore can lead to more severe forms of undernutrition,
  including hunger.</p>

  <p>Short questionnaires like the FIES are very easy to administer at limited
  cost, which is one of the main advantages of their use. The ability to
  precisely determine the food insecurity status of specific individuals or
  households, however, is limited by the small number of questions, a reason why
  assignment of individual respondents to food insecurity classes is best done
  in probability terms, thus ensuring that estimates of prevalence rates in a
  population are sufficiently reliable even when based on relatively small
  sample sizes. </p>

  <p>As with any statistical assessment, reliability and precision crucially
  depend on the quality of the survey design and implementation. One major
  advantage of the analytic treatment of the data through the Rasch model based
  methods is that it permits testing the quality of the data collected and
  evaluating the likely margin of uncertainty around estimated prevalence rates,
  which should always be reported.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>An average of less than three minutes of survey time is estimated to
  collect FIES data in a well-conducted face-to-face survey, which should make
  it possible to include the FIES-SM in a nationally representative survey in
  every country in the world, at a very reasonable cost. FAO provides versions
  of the FIES-SM adapted and translated in each of the more than 200 languages
  and dialects used in the Gallup World Poll.</p>

  <p>When used in the Gallup World Poll, with sample sizes of only about 1000
  individuals, the width of confidence intervals rarely exceeds 20% of the
  measured prevalence (that is, prevalence rates of around 50% are estimated
  with margins of errors of plus or minus 5%). Obviously, confidence intervals
  are likely to be much smaller when national prevalence rates are estimated
  using larger samples.</p>

  <p>Compared to other proposed non-official indicators of household food
  insecurity, the FIES based approach has the advantage that food insecurity
  prevalence rates are directly comparable across population groups and
  countries. Even if they use similar labels (such as &#x201C;mild&#x201D;,
  &#x201C;moderate&#x201D; and &#x201C;severe&#x201D; food insecurity) other
  approaches have yet to demonstrate the formal comparability of the thresholds
  used for classification, due to lack of the definition of a proper statistical
  model that links the values of the &#x201C;indexes&#x201D; or
  &#x201C;scores&#x201D; used for classification, to the severity of food
  insecurity. For this reason, care should be taken when comparing the results
  obtained with the FIES with those obtained with these other indicators, even
  if, unfortunately, similar labels are used to describe them.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Data at the individual or household level is collected by applying an
  experience-based food security scale questionnaire within a survey. The food
  security survey module collects answers to questions asking respondents to
  report the occurrence of several typical experiences and conditions associated
  with food insecurity. The data is analysed using the Rasch model (also known
  as one-parameter logistic model, 1-PL), which postulates that the probability
  of observing an affirmative answer by respondent i to question j, is a

  <p>Parameters a<sub>i</sub> and b<sub>j</sub> can be estimated using maximum
  likelihood procedures. Parameters a<sub>i</sub>, in particular, are
  interpreted as a measure of the severity of the food security condition for
  each respondent and are used to classify them into classes of food
  insecurity.</p>

  <p>The FIES considers the three classes of (a) food security or mild food
  insecurity; b) moderate or severe food insecurity, and (c) severe food
  insecurity, and estimates the probability of being moderately or severely food
  insecure (p<sub>mod+sev</sub>) and the probability of being severely food
  insecure (P<sub>sev</sub>) for each respondent, with 0 &lt; P<sub>sev</sub>
  &lt; P<sub>mod+sev</sub> &lt; 1. The probability of being food secure or
  mildly food insecure can be obtained as Pts = 1 - P<sub>mod+sev.</sub> </p>

  <p>Given a representative sample, the prevalence of food insecurity at
  moderate or severe levels (FI<sub>mod+sev</sub>), and at severe levels
  (FI<sub>sev</sub>) in the population are computed as the weighted sum of the
  probability of belonging to the moderate or severe food insecurity class, and
  to the severe food insecurity class, respectively, of all individual or
  household respondents in a sample:</p>

  <p>where are post-stratification weights that indicate the proportion of
  individual or households in the national population represented by each
  element in the sample.</p>

  <p>It is important to note that if w<sub>i</sub> are individual sampling
  weights, then the prevalence of food insecurity refers to the total population
  of individuals, while if they are household weights, the prevalence refers to
  the population of households. For the calculation of the indicator 2.1.2,
  objective is to produce a prevalence of individuals. This implies that:</p>

  <p>if a survey is at household level, and provides household sampling weights,
  they should be transformed to individual sampling weights by multiplying the
  weights by the household size. This individual weighting system can then be
  used to calculate the individual prevalence rates in formulas (1) and (2)</p>

  <p>If the survey includes only adults, then the adult weights applied to the
  probabilities in formulas (1) and (2) provide the adult prevalence rates
  (FI<sup>Adults</sup>). In this case, to calculate the prevalence in the total
  population, then the proportion of children who live in households where at
  least one adult is food insecure must also be calculated. This can be done by
  dividing the adult weights by the number of adults in the household and
  multiplying those approximate household weights by the number of children in
  the household. Once the approximate child weights are obtained, the prevalence
  of food insecurity of children who live in households where at least one adult
  is food insecure (FI<sup>children</sup>) can be calculated by applying these
  weights to the probabilities of food insecurity in formulas (1) and (2). The
  prevalence of food insecurity in the total population is finally calculated
  as:</p>

  insecure) in a country, at different levels of severity (N<sub>mod+sev</sub>
  and N<sub>sev</sub>). In the database, the number of food insecure people are
  expressed in thousands. </p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>For data collected by FAO through the Gallup World Poll, the country
  results have been shared with all national statistical offices through an
  email communication sent by the FAO Chief Statistician, requesting feedback,
  and published only if they did not refuse to.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>International calibration of food insecurity thresholds is performed to
  ensure national and sub-national results are comparable.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <ul>
    <li>At country level</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The indicator is not computed if no country data are available.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>At regional and global levels</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Missing values for individual countries are implicitly imputed to be equal
  to the population weighted average of the estimated values of the countries
  present in the same region.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Regional and global aggregates of the prevalence of moderate or severe food
  insecurity (FI) based on FIES are computed as: </p>

  <p>FI_REG = (_i FI_i &#xD7; N_i) / (_i N_i) </p>

  <p>where FI_i are the values of FI estimated for all countries in the regions
  for which available data allow to compute a reliable estimate, and N_i the
  corresponding population size. </p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>Experience-based food security scales data are collected through population
  surveys (either household or individual surveys) using questionnaires/modules
  that are adapted to the country language and condition.</p>

QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>ESS conducts trend analysis of the newly updated indicator with other
  relevant indicators. Meanwhile, preliminary estimates of each round of the
  update are circulated among regional offices for review. Because of their
  knowledge of their regions and countries, they often provide invaluable inputs
  to the revisions and finalization of the update. </p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>FIES data are validated through testing of adherence to the Rasch model
  assumption of equal discrimination of the items and absence of residual
  correlation and measurement of Rasch reliability indexes. Such test would
  reveal whether the data is of sufficient quality to produce reliable estimates
  of the prevalence of food insecurity according to the FIES standard. </p>

  <p>Then, item severity parameters are compared with the FIES global reference
  standard to verify the possibility of calibrating the measures against such
  standard and thus produce estimates of the prevalence of food insecurity that
  can be considered comparable across countries.</p>

  <p>Data availability:</p>

  <p>Data for 2014, 2015,2016, 2017 and 2018 are available from FAO for 137
  countries, areas and territories included in the Gallup World Poll. Regional
  and sub regional aggregates are computed for all regions, with the exceptions
  of the Caribbean and the Oceania regions (as most small island states in the
  Caribbean and in the South Pacific are not covered by the GWP) and Middle
  Africa (as less than 50% of the regional population was covered). Data have
  been subject to a country consultation process and only results validated by
  national statistical offices are published at country level. </p>

  <p>FIES compatible data from official national surveys are already available
  from Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Canada, Chile, Ecuador, Ghana, Indonesia,
  Israel, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Palestine, Republic of Korea (2014 and 2015),
  Russian Federation (2016-18), Saint Lucia, Seychelles, United States of
  America. . </p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>Only the 3-year average (2014-2016, 2015-17 and 2016-18) is provided.</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>As the FIES or any other compatible experience-based food security
  questionnaire is applied through surveys, the prevalence of food insecurity
  can be measured in any population group for which the survey used to collect
  data is representative.</p>

  <p>If applied at household level, disaggregation is thus possible based on
  household characteristics such as location, household income, composition
  (including for example presence and number of small children, members with
  disabilities, elderly members, etc.), sex, age and education of the household
  head, etc. If applied at the individual level, proper disaggregation of the
  prevalence of food insecurity by sex is possible as the prevalence of food
  insecurity among male and among female members of the same population group
  can be measured independently.</p>

  <p>When producing disaggregated statistics, attention must be devoted to
  verifying the validity of the application by estimating the Rasch model with
  the data from each specific subpopulation group and, if necessary, perform the
  appropriate equating of the measure before comparing results.</p>

  <p>It is good practice to associate a measure of variability (margins of error
  or upper and lower bound) when disaggregated data are produced.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>Sources of discrepancies:</p>

  <p>In the few cases where indicators of food insecurity based on
  experience-based food security scales have been reported by countries (U.S.,
  Canada, Mexico, Guatemala and Brazil), these have been based on nationally set
  thresholds that do not correspond to the international thresholds proposed by
  the FIES. See Annex I and Table A3 in http://www.fao.org/3/i4830e.pdf for a
  description of the differences. In the future, it is desirable that country
  would start reporting prevalence estimates using also the internationally set
  thresholds for moderate or severe and severe levels, in addition to those
  based on national thresholds.</p>

  <p>FAO is ready to provide assistance on the analytic methods needed to
  estimate prevalence based on the FIES global reference thresholds.</p>
