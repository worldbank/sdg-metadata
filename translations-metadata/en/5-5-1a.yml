  <p>Definition:</p>

  <p>The proportion of seats held by women in (a) national parliaments,
  currently as at 1 January of reporting year, is currently measured as the
  number of seats held by women members in single or lower chambers of national
  parliaments, expressed as a percentage of all occupied seats.</p>

  <p>National parliaments can be bicameral or unicameral. This indicator covers
  the single chamber in unicameral parliaments and the lower chamber in
  bicameral parliaments. It does not cover the upper chamber of bicameral
  parliaments. Seats are usually won by members in general parliamentary
  elections. Seats may also be filled by nomination, appointment, indirect
  election, rotation of members and by-election.</p>

  <p>Seats refer to the number of parliamentary mandates, or the number of
  members of parliament.</p>

  <p>Concepts:</p>

  <p>Seats refer to the number of parliamentary mandates, also known as the
  number of members of parliament. Seats are usually won by members in general
  parliamentary elections. Seats may also be filled by nomination, appointment,
  indirect election, rotation of members and by-election.</p>

SOURCE_TYPE: <p>The data used are official statistics received from parliaments.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The data are provided by national parliaments and updated after an election
  or parliamentary renewal. National parliaments also transmit their data to the
  IPU at least once a year and when the numbers change significantly. IPU member
  parliaments provide information on changes and updates to the IPU secretariat.
  After each general election or renewal a questionnaire is dispatched to
  parliaments to solicit the latest available data. If no response is provided,
  other methods are used to obtain the information, such as from the electoral
  management body, parliamentary web sites or Internet searches. Additional
  information gathered from other sources is regularly crosschecked with
  parliament. </p>

  <p>The indicator measures the degree to which women have equal access to
  parliamentary decision making. Women&#x2019;s participation in parliaments is
  a key aspect of women&#x2019;s opportunities in political and public life, and
  is therefore linked to women&#x2019;s empowerment. Equal numbers of women and
  men in lower chambers would give an indicator value of 50 per cent.</p>

  <p>A stronger presence of women in parliament allows new concerns to be
  highlighted on political agendas, and new priorities to be put into practice
  through the adoption and implementation of policies and laws. The inclusion of
  the perspectives and interests of women is a prerequisite for democracy and
  gender equality, and contributes to good governance. A representative
  parliament also allows the different experiences of men and women to affect
  the social, political and economic future of societies.</p>

  <p>Changes in the indicator have been tracked over time. Although the
  international community has supported and promoted women&#x2019;s
  participation in political decision-making structures for several decades,
  improvement in women&#x2019;s access to parliament has been slow. This has led
  to the introduction of special policy and legal measures to increase
  women&#x2019;s shares of parliamentary seats in several countries. Those
  countries that have adopted special measures generally have greater
  representation of women in parliament than countries without special
  measures.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: |-
  <ul>
    <li>The number of countries covered varies with suspensions or dissolutions of parliaments. As of 1 February 2016, 193 countries are included.</li>
    <li>There can be difficulties in obtaining information on by-election results and replacements due to death or resignation. These changes are ad hoc events which are more difficult to keep track of. By-elections, for instance, are often not announced internationally as general elections are.</li>
    <li>The data excludes the numbers and percentages of women in upper chambers of parliament. The information in available on the IPU website at <a href="https://data.ipu.org/women-ranking">https://data.ipu.org/women-ranking</a>.</li>
    <li>Parliaments vary considerably in their internal workings and procedures, however, generally legislate, oversee government and represent the electorate. In terms of measuring women&#x2019;s contribution to political decision making, this indicator may not be sufficient because some women may face obstacles in fully and efficiently carrying out their parliamentary mandate.</li>
  </ul>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The proportion of seats held by women in national parliament is derived by
  dividing the total number of seats occupied by women by the total number of
  seats in parliament.</p>

  <p>Data availability:</p>

  <p>Data are available for 193 countries. Information is available in all
  countries where a national legislature exists and therefore does not include
  parliaments that have been dissolved or suspended for an indefinite
  period.</p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>According to the IPU website the data extraction has changed over time as
  follows;</p>

  <p>Disaggregation:</p>

  <p>The indicator can be disaggregated for analysis by geographical region and
  sub-region, legislature type (single or lower, parliamentary or presidential),
  the method of filling seats (directly elected, indirectly elected, appointed)
  and the use of special measures.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>Sources of discrepancies:</p>

  <p>Data are not adjusted for international comparability. Though, for
  international comparisons, generally only the single or lower house is
  considered in calculating the indicator.</p>
