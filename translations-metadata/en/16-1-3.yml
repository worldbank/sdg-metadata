  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The total number of persons who have been victim of physical, psychological
  or sexual violence in the previous 12 months, as a share of the total
  population.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>This indicator measures the prevalence of victimization from physical,
  psychological or sexual violence</p>

  <p>Physical violence: This concept is equivalent to the concept of physical
  assault, as defined in the International Classification of Crime for
  Statistical Purposes (ICCS): the intentional or reckless application of
  physical force inflicted upon the body of a person. This includes serious and
  minor bodily injuries and serious and minor physical force. According to the
  ICCS, these are defined as:</p>

  <p>Serious bodily injury, at minimum, includes gunshot or bullet wounds; knife
  or stab wounds; severed limbs; broken bones or teeth knocked out; internal
  injuries; being knocked unconscious; and other severe or critical
  injuries.</p>

  <p>Serious physical force, at minimum, includes being shot; stabbed or cut;
  hit by an object; hit by a thrown object; poisoning and other applications of
  force with the potential to cause serious bodily injury.</p>

  <p>Minor bodily injury, at minimum, includes bruises, cuts, scratches, chipped
  teeth, swelling, black eye and other minor injuries.</p>

  <p>Minor physical force, at minimum, includes hitting, slapping, pushing,
  tripping, knocking down and other applications of force with the potential to
  cause minor bodily injury.</p>

  <p>Sexual violence (ICCS): Unwanted sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual
  act, or contact or communication with unwanted sexual attention without valid
  consent or with consent as a result of intimidation, force, fraud, coercion,
  threat, deception, use of drugs or alcohol, or abuse of power or of a position
  of vulnerability. This includes rape and other forms of sexual assault.</p>

  <p>Psychological violence: There is as yet no consensus at the international
  level of the precise definition of psychological violence and there is as yet
  no generally well-established methodology to measure psychological
  violence.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>This indicator is derived from surveys on crime victimization or from other
  household surveys with a module on crime victimization.</p>

  <p>The indicator refers to individual experience of the respondent, who is
  randomly selected among the household members, while experience of other
  members is not to be included. Experience of violent victimization is
  collected through a series of questions on concrete acts of violence suffered
  by the respondent.</p>

  <p>UNODC collects data on the prevalence of physical and sexual assault
  through its annual data collection (UN-CTS). The data collection through the
  UN-CTS is facilitated by a network of over 130 national Focal Points appointed
  by responsible authorities.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>There is a consolidated system of annual data collection on crime and
  criminal justice (UN- Crime Trends Survey, UN-CTS) which represents the basis
  of data on intentional homicide. The UN-CTS data collection is largely based
  on the network of national Focal Points, which are institutions/officials
  appointed by countries and having the technical capacity and role to produce
  data on crime and criminal justice (around 130 appointed Focal Points as of
  2016).</p>

  <p>The UN-CTS collects data on reporting rate by victims of &#x201C;physical
  assault&#x201D; and &#x201C;sexual assault&#x201D;. The current data
  collection will be reviewed to collect more precise data on this
  indicator.</p>

  <p>Data for SDG monitoring will be sent to countries for consultation prior to
  publication.</p>

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>This indicator measures the prevalence of victimization from physical,
  sexual (and, possibly, psychological) violence. It is globally relevant as
  violence in various forms occurs in all regions and countries of the world.
  Given that acts of violence are heavily underreported to the authorities, this
  indicator needs to be based on data collected through sample surveys of the
  adult population.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Crime victimization surveys are able to capture experience of violence
  suffered by adult population of both sexes; however, due to the complexity of
  collecting information on experiences of violence, it is likely that not all
  experiences of violence are duly covered by these surveys, which aim to cover
  several types of crime experience. Other dedicated surveys on violence usually
  focus on selected population groups (typically women, children or the elderly)
  or in specific contexts (domestic violence, schools, prisons, etc.), but they
  are not able to portray levels and trends of violence in the entire
  population.</p>

  <p>While there are already international standards on measuring physical and
  sexual violence through survey instruments, there is currently no
  international standard on the measurement of psychological violence. One
  practical option could be to limit psychological violence to threatening
  behaviour, which does have an established methodology of measurement in
  victimization surveys. Threatening behaviour, at minimum, is an intentional
  behaviour that causes fear of injury or harm.</p>

  <p>Finally, indicators on prevalence of physical and sexual violence are
  usually produced and reported separately; the production of data on the
  prevalence of physical or sexual violence requires ad-hoc data collection.</p>

  <p>Victimization surveys (as dedicated surveys or as modules of household
  surveys) are usually restricted to the general population living in households
  above a certain age (typically 15 or 18 years of age), while sometimes an
  upper age limit is also applied (typically 65, 70 or 75 years of age).</p>
