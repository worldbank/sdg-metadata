  <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>

  <p>The researchers (in full-time equivalent - FTE) per million inhabitants is
  a direct measure of the number of research and experimental development
  (R&amp;D) workers per 1 million people.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Frascati
  Manual (OECD, 2015) provides the relevant definitions for research and
  experimental development (R&amp;D), gross domestic expenditure on research and
  experimental development (R&amp;D) and researchers. Although an Organisation
  for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) manual, the application is
  global. During the 6th revision of the Frascati Manual, developing country
  issues were mainstreamed in the core of the Manual. The 7th edition was
  released in October 2015.</p>

  <p>The following definitions, taken from the 2015 edition of the Frascati
  Manual are relevant for computing the indicator. </p>

  <p>Research and experimental development (R&amp;D) comprise creative and
  systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge
  &#x2013; including knowledge of humankind, culture and society &#x2013; and to
  devise new applications of available knowledge.</p>

  <p>Researchers are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new
  knowledge. They conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories,
  models, techniques instrumentation, software or operational methods.</p>

  <p>The Full-time equivalent (FTE) of research and experimental development
  (R&amp;D) personnel is defined as the ratio of working hours actually spent on
  research and experimental development (R&amp;D) during a specific reference
  period (usually a calendar year) divided by the total number of hours
  conventionally worked in the same period by an individual or by a group.</p>
UNIT_MEASURE: <p>Per million population</p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>The main methodological guide, which provides international standard
  guidelines for measuring research and experimental development (R&amp;D) is
  the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Frascati
  Manual (Frascati Manual 2015: Guidelines for Collecting and Reporting Data on
  Research and Experimental Development: <a
  href="http://www.oecdilibrary.org/science-and-technology/frascati-manual-2015_9789264239012-en">http://www.oecdilibrary.org/science-and-technology/frascati-manual-2015_9789264239012-en</a>).</p>

  <p>In addition to the above, the following international classifications are
  used to facilitate the research and experimental development (R&amp;D) data
  compilation process and the presentation of research and experimental
  development (R&amp;D) statistics by various disaggregation: </p>

  Activities</p>

SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Data are collected through national research and experimental development
  (R&amp;D) surveys, either by the national statistical office or a line
  ministry (such as the Ministry for Science and Technology).</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) sends out a questionnaire every
  year to collect research and experimental development (R&amp;D) data from all
  countries (around 125 countries), which are not covered by the data
  collections of the other partner organizations such as the Organisation for
  Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Eurostat (Statistical Office of
  the European Union) and the Network on Science and Technology Indicators
  &#x2013; Ibero-American and Inter-American (RICYT). In agreement with these
  three organisations, their data (which were collected from their member
  states/associated member states &#x2013; around 65 countries-) are directly
  obtained from the respective databases (in the case of the Organisation for
  Economic Co-operation and Development - OECD and Statistical Office of the
  European Union - Eurostat) or received from the partner (in the case of the
  Network on Science and Technology Indicators &#x2013; Ibero-American and
  Inter-American - RICYT). There is also collaboration in Africa with the
  African Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) Indicators Initiative (ASTII)
  of the African Union Development Agency-NEPAD (AUDA-NEPAD). </p>

  <p>For the countries to which the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) sends
  a questionnaire, the process is the following:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>A questionnaire is sent to focal points in countries, generally within the Ministry of Science and Technology or the national statistical office.</li>
    <li>The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) processes the questionnaires, communicating with the countries in case of questions, calculates indicators and releases the data and indicators on its website. </li>
    <li>Countries are requested to complete the questionnaire using the standard international classifications, therefore adjustments are generally not needed.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The other agencies have similar procedures.</p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) sends out the questionnaire in
  June every year. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
  (OECD) and the Statistical Office of the European Union (Eurostat) collect
  data twice per year. The Network on Science and Technology Indicators &#x2013;
  Ibero-American and Inter-American (RICYT) collects data once per year.</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: <p>March and October every year</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-

INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) is the statistical branch of the
  United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The
  Institute produces internationally comparable data and methodologies in the
  fields of education, science, culture and communication for countries at all
  stages of development.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The indicator is a direct measure of the number of research and
  experimental development (R&amp;D) workers per 1 million people referred to in
  the target.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Research and experimental development (R&amp;D) data need to be collected
  through surveys, which are expensive, and are not done on a regular basis in
  many developing countries. Furthermore, (developing) countries do not always
  cover all sectors of performance. In particular the business sector is not
  always covered.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Computation of the indicator Researchers (in full-time equivalent) per
  million inhabitants uses available population data as denominator.</p>

  <p>The number researchers (in full-time equivalent - FTE) per million
  inhabitants <em>(RES<sub>Density</sub>)</em> is calculated as:</p>

DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>For each questionnaire received from countries where the UNESCO Institute
  for Statistics (UIS) sends questionnaire to, the UNESCO Institute for
  Statistics (UIS) executes a series of quality checks and sends back a data
  processing report identifying problematic issues/inconsistent data to
  countries for their feedback, corrections as well as validation of
  indicators.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>To inform of any discrepancies between standard classifications and
  national practices, appropriate footnotes are accompanied with data/indicators
  to adequately document the results and provide explanations.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>

  <p> Missing data are not estimated by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics
  (UIS).</p>

  <p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>

  <p>Imputations are based on interpolations or extrapolations of data for other
  reference years. Second option is to make an estimate for full-time equivalent
  (FTE) based on available headcount data. In case no data are available at all,
  the unweighted regional average is used as an estimate.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Missing data are imputed using the methodology described above. The data
  for researchers in full-time equivalent (FTE) are then added up by region and
  divided by the population data for that region. Similar for the global
  total.</p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>Countries are responsible themselves for the collection of research and
  experimental development (R&amp;D) data at the national level, compile
  national totals and submit them to international organisations. All countries
  follow the guidelines of the Frascati Manual: <a

  Countries starting to measure research and experimental development (R&amp;D)
  can use the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) Technical Paper 11 for
  assistance, which can be downloaded here: <a

QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) maintains a set of data
  processing guidelines/standards as well as data processing tools to facilitate
  processing of data and ensure the quality of data.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>The process of quality assurance includes review of survey
  documentations/metadata, examination of reliability of data, make sure they
  comply with international standards (including the Organisation for Economic
  Co-operation and Development - OECD Frascati Manual), and examine the
  consistency and coherence within the data set as well as with the time series
  of data and the resulting indicators. During the data processing stage, for
  each questionnaire received from countries where the UNESCO Institute for
  Statistics (UIS) sends questionnaire to, the above quality aspects are looked
  into and a data report is produced identifying problematic issues/inconsistent
  data for each respective country. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS)
  sends such data reports, including the calculated indicators for target 9.5,
  providing the countries with the opportunity to review the data/indicators and
  submit any clarifications or modifications/additions before releasing data at
  the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) Data Centre and submitting the data
  to UN Statistics Division for inclusion in the global SDG Indicators
  Database.</p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>The data should comply with the concepts/definitions and guidelines
  provided in the international standards (i.e. the Organisation for Economic
  Co-operation and Development - OECD Frascati Manual) and should cover all
  sectors of performance, representing all institutions, which are engaged in
  research and experimental development (R&amp;D) activities in the country.
  Criteria for quality assessment include: data sources must include proper
  documentation; data values must be nationally representative, if not, should
  be footnoted; data are plausible and based on trends and consistency with
  previously published/reported values.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>Data available for over 140 countries for Researchers (in full-time
  equivalent - FTE) per million inhabitants</p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>Data available in the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) database since
  reference year 1996, but historical data available back to 1981 </p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>Researchers can be broken down by sector of employment, field of science,
  sex and age.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>There are no differences in the underlying data. Difference may occur due
  to the use of difference data for the denominator used to calculate
  indicators.</p>
