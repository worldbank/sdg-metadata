  <p>The indicator includes 14.1.1a Index of coastal eutrophication (ICEP) and
  14.1.1b Plastic debris density. SDG 14.1.1a and SDG 14.1.1b are described as
  two indicators. Across the 14.1.1a and 14.1.1b, Three levels are proposed:
  </p>

  <p>Level 1: Globally available data from earth observations and modelling </p>

  <p>Level 2: National data which will be collected from countries (through the
  relevant Regional Seas Programme, where applicable (i.e. for countries that
  are a member of a Regional Seas Programme)</p>

  <p>Level 3: Additional indicators which are suggested that countries might
  consider collecting (these are not discussed in this document) </p>

  <p>The below tables demonstrate the proposed parameters for SDG Target 14.1.1a
  and 14.1.1b.</p>

INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The UNEP Regional Seas Programme is UNEP&#x2019;s most important regional
  mechanism for conservation of the marine and coastal environment since its
  establishment in 1974. These Multilateral Environmental Agreements are
  governed by their own meetings of the Contracting Parties. The individual
  Regional Seas Conventions and Action Plans have both a normative and
  implementation mandate. They provide an expression of common regional
  priorities, including those in the delivery of global mandates such as the
  2030 Agenda, provisions of Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) and
  United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) resolutions. They also provide
  platforms for acting, including through integrated assessment, policy
  development, capacity building and exchange, as well as through implementation
  of projects. By building on the mandates of Regional Seas in addressing
  adverse impacts to the marine and coastal environment, UNEP can enhance impact
  and sustainability of efforts by utilization of advantages of the Regional
  Seas under the programme of work at the regional
  level.https://www.unep.org/explore-topics/oceans-seas/what-we-do/regional-seas-programme</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Coastal areas are areas of high productivity where inputs from land, sea,
  air and people converge. With over 40 percent of the human population residing
  in coastal areas, ecosystem degradation in these areas can have
  disproportionate effects on society (IGOS, 2006). One of the largest pressures
  on coastal environments is eutrophication, resulting primarily from land-based
  nutrient input from agricultural runoff and domestic wastewater discharge.
  Coastal eutrophication can lead to serious damage to marine ecosystems, vital
  sea habitats, and can cause the spread of harmful algal blooms. </p>

  <p>Marine litter is found in all the world&#x2019;s oceans and seas. It
  constitutes an increasing risk to ecosystem health and biodiversity while
  entailing substantial economic costs through its impacts on public health,
  tourism, fishing and aquaculture.</p>

  <p>Target 14.1 aims to reduce the impacts of pollution through prevention and
  reduction of marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based
  activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>This methodology mobilizes the collection of widely available earth
  observation data and other data sources which will be validated by countries.
  The methodologies used to generate this data are technical in nature. The
  methodology employs internationally recognized methods, from expert
  communities such as the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) and international
  space agencies and technical experts. There is a need to provide training on
  these indicators over time.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>The Indicator is designed in a way to generate data to allow informed
  decision making towards identifying the state of pollution and pollution flows
  in oceans. It is assumed that countries would use the data to actively make
  decisions, but as oceans are transboundary, it makes this decision-making
  complex. Additionally, there is a need to consider data on pollution
  generation and waste in conjunction with these indicators.</p>

  <p>For 14.1.1a:</p>

  <p>Level 1: Indicator for coastal eutrophication potential </p>

  <p>The indicator for coastal eutrophication potential (ICEP), is based on
  loads and ratios of nitrogen, phosphorus and silica delivered by rivers to
  coastal waters. This indicator assumes that excess nitrogen or phosphorus
  relative to silica will result in increased growth of potentially harmful
  algae (ICEP&gt;0). This indicator is based on loads and ratios of nitrogen,
  phosphorous and silica delivered by rivers to coastal waters (Garnier et al.
  2010) which contribute to the ICEP. The basis for these loads is collected
  from land-based assessments of land use including fertilizer use, population
  density, socioeconomic factors and other contributors to nutrient pollution
  runoff. Given the land-based nature of the indicator, it provides a modelled
  number indicating the risk of coastal eutrophication at a specific river
  mouth. </p>

  <p>The indicator can be further developed by incorporating in situ monitoring
  to evaluate the dispersion of concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorous and
  silica to ground-truth the index. The indicator assumes that excess
  concentrations of nitrogen or phosphorus relative to silica will result in
  increased growth of potentially harmful algae (ICEP&gt;0). ICEP is expressed
  in kilograms of carbon (from algae biomass) per square kilometre of river
  basin area per day (kg C km-2 day-1). </p>

  <p>The ICEP model is calculated using one of two equations depending on
  whether nitrogen or phosphorus is limiting. The equations (Billen and Garnier
  2007) are</p>

  <p>Level 1: Chlorophyll-A deviation modelling</p>

  <p>Satellite-based assessments of ocean colour began in 1978 with the launch
  of the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) aboard the NASA Nimbus 7 satellite.
  Following a decade long break in observations, there has been continuous
  satellite ocean colour since 1997 with SeaWiFS, followed by MERIS, MODIS
  (Terra, Aqua), VIIRS (NPP, N20) and now OLCI (S-3A, S-3B). Data gaps from
  individual sensors are common due to revisit cycles, cloud cover, and spurious
  retrievals resulting from a host of confounding atmospheric and aquatic
  conditions. This issue has been addressed by combining data from multiple
  sensors and creating a consistent, merged ocean colour product (e.g.,
  chlorophyll-a). The ESA Ocean Colour CCI (OC-CCI) project, led by the Plymouth
  Marine Laboratory (PML), has produced a consistent, merged chlorophyll-a
  product from SeaWiFS, MODIS, MERIS and VIIRS, spanning 1997 to 2018
  (Sathyendranath et al., 2018). A merged multi-sensor product will be updated
  in both time and with data from additional sensors (e.g., OLCI) under a
  forthcoming EUMETSAT initiative that will continue the time series on an
  operational basis.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>For SDG 14.1.1a, Chlorophyll-a (4 km resolution, monthly products) will be
  derived from the OC-CCI project is generated for each individual pixel within
  a country&#x2019;s Coastal Zone. For generation of a climatological baseline,
  results are averaged by month over the time period of 2000 &#x2013; 2004.
  Pixels with differences from the baseline that are in the 90th percentile of
  values &gt;0 across the cumulative global EEZ and/or territorial waters. The
  percentage of pixels in a country&#x2019;s EEZ and/or territorial waters that
  are identified as deviating from the baseline (falling in the 90th percentile)
  will be calculated for each national EEZ and/or territorial waters by month.
  The annual average of these monthly values is then calculated.</p>

  <p>Level 2: In situ monitoring of nutrients</p>

  <p>Where national capacity to do so exists, national level measurements of
  Chlorophyll-a and other parameters (including nitrogen, phosphate and silica)
  (in situ or from remote sensing), should be used to complement and ground
  truth global remote sensing and modelled data and enable a more detailed
  assessment of eutrophication. In particular, monitoring of supplementary
  eutrophication parameters is advisable to determine whether an increase in
  Chlorophyll-a concentration is directly linked to an anthropogenic increase in
  nutrients. Please refer to Table 2 for parameters for monitoring
  eutrophication at the national level (Level 2). </p>

  <p>Level 2: National ICEP modelling</p>

  <p>Existing ICEP modelling at the national level is limited, but could be
  further developed following the model of a current study analysing basin level
  data in Chinese rivers (Strokal et al 2016). The study utilises Global NEWS
  &#x2013; 2 (Nutrient Export from WaterSheds) and NUtrient flows in Food
  chains, Environment and Resources use (NUFER) as models. The Global NEWS-2
  model is basin-scale and quantifies river export of various nutrients
  (nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon and silica) in multiple forms (dissolved
  inorganic, dissolved organic and particulate) as functions of human activities
  on land and basin characteristics (Strokal et al 2016). Furthermore, the model
  shows past and future trends.</p>

  <p>For 14.1.1b:</p>

  <p>Level 1: Plastic patches greater than 10 meters</p>

  <p>Satellite-based global data products make up the statistics for this
  indicator. NASA and ESA both contribute satellite images to construct
  information on the plastic patches greater than 10 meters throughout the
  world&#x2019;s oceans. Multi-spectral satellite remote sensing of plastic in
  the water column is currently only possible for larger elements (more than
  10m) and under good atmospheric conditions (no clouds). This data is being
  produced in collaboration with ESA and NASA.</p>

  <p>Level 1: Beach litter originating from national land-based sources</p>

  <p>Modelling of litter movement through the oceans occurs through numerical
  models using inputs including ocean flow and marine plastic litter
  characteristics. UN Environment has produced a global model of marine litter
  using OceanParcels v2.0, a state-of-the-art Lagrangian Ocean analysis
  framework to create customizable particle tracking simulation using outputs
  from ocean circulation models.</p>

  <p>This model was used to estimate where plastics that would be found on the
  coast likely originated from. As a simple example, for Kenya, based on this
  model, of the plastic which ends up on Kenya&#x2019;s beaches, 11% likely
  originated from Kenya, 60% likely came from countries in Africa and 29% likely
  came from outside the region. This model can be produced annually and updated
  as better waste emissions data becomes available for countries. </p>

  <p>Level 2: Beach litter, plastic in the sea column and floating plastic and
  plastic on the sea floor (average count of plastic items per
  km<sup>2</sup>)</p>

  <p>The details for collecting data for beach litter, plastic in the sea column
  and floating plastic and plastic on the sea floor are in the global manual and
  in the GESAMP Guidelines (GESAMP 2019). Beach litter is the most available
  type of data at the national level. National efforts to collect data on beach
  litter can be supported by campaigns to engage members of the public as
  volunteers in beach clean-ups (see for example the Ocean Conservancy&#x2019;s
  International Coastal Clean-up (ICC) initiative) or citizen science programmes
  (see for example NOAA&#x2019;s Marine Debris Monitoring and Assessment Citizen
  Science Project). Specific instructions on how to conduct citizen science
  beach surveys are included in the GESAMP Guidelines (GESAMP 2019). </p>

  <p>Beyond the tools used to conduct beach litter monitoring, it is important
  to consider the timing of surveys in order to properly plan effective surveys.
  The GESAMP Guidelines explain two main types of surveying beaches including
  rapid assessment surveys and routine shoreline monitoring. Rapid assessment
  surveys are best conducted in response to natural disasters, to build a
  baseline for future surveys and/or to identify beach litter hotspots. (see:
  https://environmentlive.unep.org/media/docs/marine_plastics/une_science_dvision_gesamp_reports.pdf).</p>

  <p>The average count of plastic items can be computed for each area sampled. A
  geospatial model is recommended in order to estimate the density across the
  coastline and to establish a national average.</p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>The data validation for this indicator will differ according to the level
  classification of the indicator measured:</p>

  <p>Level 1: All globally available data (estimated or modelled) will be shared
  with national statistical offices and other relevant authorities for
  in-country validation and to replace with national data if available and if
  not to provide UNEP the no objection to publish the data.</p>

  <p>Level 2: The data for all sub indicators will be national data reported to
  UNEP through the Regional Seas. The first data validation will be done by the
  Regional Seas and later by UNEP before reporting it to UNSD SDG Global
  Database.</p>

  <p>Level 3: the data is a list of supplementary information which is suggested
  that countries consider monitoring and does not require any reporting and
  validation.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: <p>No adjustments are made</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p><strong>&#x2022;</strong> <strong>At country level</strong></p>

  <p>At country level due to the use of globally derived data for some
  sub-indicators, it is not expected to have missing data for these
  sub-indicators. For all other sub-indicators, missing values are not imputed.
  </p>

  <p><strong>&#x2022;</strong> <strong>At regional and global
  levels</strong></p>

  <p>missing values are not imputed</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>The data will be aggregated at the sub-regional, regional and global
  levels. For the aggregation methods, please see:
  http://wesr.unep.org/media/docs/graphs/aggregation_methods.pdf. </p>
DOC_METHOD: <p>Refer to section 4.d</p>
QUALITY_MGMNT: <p>Refer to section 4.d</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: <p>Refer to section 4.d</p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: <p>Refer to section 4.d</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>Data will be made available for all member states.</p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>The reporting on this indicator is described in the table for each
  sub-indicator. Reporting will initiate in 2020 for the global indicator on
  chl-a and plastic modelling. For the other globally derived indicators,
  reporting will initiate in 2021. National data collection through the Regional
  Seas already exists for many Regional Seas, this data will be compiled for SDG
  reporting in 2020.</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>A geospatial disaggregation of the state of pollution is proposed. For the
  ICEP loading indicators, this disaggregation should be at the sub-basin
  level.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies: </strong></p>

  <p>There are a number of experiences in terms of collecting data on marine
  plastics and some do not follow a consistent methodology. Similarly, the
  underlying national nutrient data which feeds into national or global ICEP
  modelling may include discrepancies (for example, in some cases different
  national ministries maintain data on fertilizer, wastewater, etc.). It is
  recommended that national statistical systems review and work to eliminate
  discrepancies in the underlying data for these indictors.</p>
