  <p><strong>NDCs</strong></p>

  <p>The Paris Agreement requires each Party to prepare, communicate and
  maintain successive <em>nationally determined contributions (NDCs)</em>
  including mitigation, adaptation and support measures. </p>

  <p>The <a href="https://unfccc.int/node/617" target="_blank">Paris
  Agreement</a> (Article 4, paragraph 2) requires each Party to prepare,
  communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions (NDCs)
  that it intends to achieve. Parties shall pursue domestic mitigation measures,
  with the aim of achieving the objectives of such contributions.</p>

  <p>Starting in 2023 and then every five years, governments will take stock of
  the implementation of the Agreement to assess the collective progress towards
  achieving the purpose of the Agreement and its long-term goals. The outcome of
  the global stocktake (GST) will inform the preparation of subsequent NDCs, in
  order to allow for increased ambition and climate action to achieve the
  purpose of the Paris Agreement and its long-term goals. <a

  <p><strong>NAPs</strong></p>

  <p>The <em>national adaptation plan (NAP)</em> process was established under
  the <a href="https://unfccc.int/adaptation/items/5852.php">Cancun Adaptation
  Framework</a> (CAF). It enables Parties to formulate and implement
  <em>national adaptation plans (NAPs)</em> as a means of identifying medium-
  and long-term adaptation needs and developing and implementing strategies and
  programmes to address those needs. It is a continuous, progressive and
  iterative process which follows a country-driven, gender-sensitive,
  participatory and fully transparent approach supported by technical guidelines
  and up to USD 3 million per developing country through the Green Climate Fund
  Readiness and Preparatory Support Programme, intended to support the
  formulation of NAPs. Technical guidelines for the NAP process are available at
  &lt;<a
  href="https://unfccc.int/topics/adaptation-and-resilience/workstreams/national-adaptation-plans-naps/guidelines-for-national-adaptation-plans-naps">unfccc.int</a>&gt;;
  NAPs received by the UNFCCC secretariat are posted at &lt;<a
  href="https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/NAPC/News/Pages/national_adaptation_plans.aspx">unfccc.int</a>&gt;.</p>

  <p><strong>Long term strategies </strong></p>

  <p>Under the Paris Agreement, all Parties should further strive to formulate
  and <em>communicate long-term low greenhouse gas emission development
  strategies</em> to provide a context and integrated long-term view to their
  NDCs. </p>

  <p>In accordance with Article 4, paragraph 19, of the Paris Agreement, all
  Parties should strive to formulate and communicate long-term low greenhouse
  gas emission development strategies, mindful of Article 2 taking into account
  their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities,
  in the light of different national circumstances.</p>

  <p>The COP, by its decision 1/CP 21, paragraph 35, invited Parties to
  communicate, by 2020, to the secretariat mid-century, long-term low greenhouse
  gas emission development strategies in accordance with Article 4, paragraph
  19, of the Agreement. Further information is available at &lt;<a
  href="https://unfccc.int/process/the-paris-agreement/long-term-strategies">unfccc.int</a>&gt;</p>

  <p><strong>Adaptation communications</strong></p>

  <p>Under the Paris Agreement&#x2019;s Article 7, paragraphs 10 and 11, each
  Party should, as appropriate, submit and update periodically an adaptation
  communication, which may include its priorities, implementation and support
  needs, plans and actions. The purpose of the adaptation communication is to
  strengthen the visibility and profile of adaptation, balance with mitigation,
  actions, support, learning and understanding. Parties may include information
  on e.g. their circumstances, institutions, vulnerabilities, adaptation
  priorities, plans, needs, progress achieved, co-benefits, other frameworks,
  gender aspects, and indigenous knowledge. The adaptation communications will
  be recorded in a public registry maintained by the secretariat, and they will
  provide input to the process of Global Stocktake every five years. The
  adaptation communications received so far are currently available at
  https://unfccc.int/topics/adaptation-and-resilience/workstreams/adaptation-communications.</p>

  <p><strong>National communications</strong></p>

  <p>The Convention established several processes to foster transparency and
  accountability of countries&#x2019; actions to address climate change. Under
  Article 12, all Parties are asked to submit national inventories and national
  communications (NCs) to report on the implementation of the Convention. This
  reporting is required at different levels of stringency and with varying
  frequency for different Parties. National Communications received by the
  UNFCCC secretariat are available at &lt;<a

  <p>Rationale and concepts, comments and limitations:</p>

  <p>Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),
  all Parties shall formulate, implement, publish and regularly update
  national/regional programmes containing measures to mitigate climate change
  and to facilitate adequate adaptation, while taking into account their common
  but differentiated responsibilities and their specific national and regional
  development priorities, objectives and circumstances. These policies and
  measures should be appropriate for the specific conditions of each Party and
  should be integrated with national development programmes.</p>

  <p>The Convention established several processes to foster transparency and
  accountability of countries&#x2019; actions to address climate change.</p>

  <p>The Paris Agreement<sup><a href="#footnote-3"
  id="footnote-ref-3">[2]</a></sup> builds upon the Convention and brings all
  nations into a common cause to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate
  change and adapt to its effects, with enhanced support to assist developing
  countries to do so, charting a new course in the global climate effort. The
  Paris Agreement&#x2019;s central aim is to strengthen the global response to
  the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century
  well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts
  to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
  Additionally, the agreement aims to strengthen the ability of countries to
  deal with the impacts of climate change. </p>
