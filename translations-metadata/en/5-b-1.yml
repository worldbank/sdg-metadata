  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The proportion of individuals who own a mobile telephone, by sex is defined
  as the &#x2018;proportion of individuals who own a mobile telephone, by
  sex&#x2019;.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>An individual owns a mobile cellular phone if he/she has a mobile cellular
  phone device with at least one active SIM card for personal use. Mobile
  cellular phones supplied by employers that can be used for personal reasons
  (to make personal calls, access the Internet, etc.) are included. Individuals
  who have only active SIM card(s) and not a mobile phone device are excluded.
  Individuals who have a mobile phone for personal use that is not registered
  under his/her name are also included. An active SIM card is a SIM card that
  has been used in the last three months.</p>

  <p>A mobile (cellular) telephone refers to a portable telephone subscribing to
  a public mobile telephone service using cellular technology, which provides
  access to the PSTN. This includes analogue and digital cellular systems and
  technologies such as IMT-2000 (3G) and IMT-Advanced. Users of both postpaid
  subscriptions and prepaid accounts are included.</p>
UNIT_MEASURE: <p>Percentage of individuals</p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>For countries that collect this data through an official survey, and if
  data allow breakdown and disaggregation, the indicator can be broken down by
  region (urban/rural), by sex, by age group, by educational level (ISCED), by
  labour force status (ILO), and by occupation (ISCO). ITU collects data for all
  of these breakdowns from countries.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>This indicator is a newly developed ITU indicator that was approved by the
  World Telecommunication/ICT Indicators Symposium (WTIS) in 2014. The
  indicator&#x2019;s definition and methodology were developed under the
  coordination of ITU, through its Expert Groups and following an extensive
  consultation process with countries. Data for the proportion of individuals
  owning a mobile phone were first collected in 2015, through an annual
  questionnaire that ITU sends to national statistical offices (NSO). In this
  questionnaire, through which ITU already collects a number of ICT indicators,
  ITU collects absolute values. The percentages are calculated a-posteriori. The
  survey methodology is verified to ensure that it meets adequate statistical
  standards. The data are verified to ensure consistency with previous
  years&#x2019; data and other relevant country-level indicators (ICT and
  economic).</p>

  <p>Data are usually not adjusted, but discrepancies in the definition, age
  scope of individuals, reference period or the break in comparability between
  years are noted in a data note. For this reason, data are not always strictly
  comparable.</p>

  <p>As the UN specialized agency for ICTs, ITU is the official source for

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Mobile phone networks have spread rapidly over the last decade and the
  number of mobile-cellular subscriptions is quasi equal to the number of the
  people living on earth. However, not every person uses, or owns a
  mobile-cellular telephone. Mobile phone ownership, in particular, is important
  to track gender equality since the mobile phone is a personal device that, if
  owned and not just shared, provides women with a degree of independence and
  autonomy, including for professional purposes. A number of studies have
  highlighted the link between mobile phone ownership and empowerment, and
  productivity growth.</p>

  <p>Existing data on the proportion of women owning a mobile phone suggest that
  less women than men own a mobile phone. This indicator highlights the
  importance of mobile phone ownership to track and to improve gender equality,
  and monitoring will help design targeted policies to overcome the gender
  divide. The collection of this indicator was proposed by the Task Group on
  Gender of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>While the data on the &#x2018;proportion of individuals who own a mobile
  telephone&#x2019; currently only exist for very few countries, ITU is
  encouraging all countries to collect data on this indicator through national
  household surveys and the indicator is expected to be added to the Partnership
  on Measuring ICT for Development&#x2019;s Core List of Indicators. The number
  of countries with official data for this indicator is expected to increase in
  the near future.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Countries can collect data on this indicator through national household
  surveys. This indicator is calculated by dividing the total number of in-scope
  individuals who own a mobile phone by the total number of in-scope
  individuals.</p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>Data are submitted by Member States to ITU. ITU checks and validates the
  data, in consultation with the Member States. </p>
ADJUSTMENT: <p>No adjustments are made to the data submitted by countries.</p>

  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>Overall, the indicator is available for more than 80 countries at least
  from one survey.</p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>2015 onwards</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>For countries that collect this indicator through a national household
  survey, and if data allow breakdown and disaggregation, the indicator can be
  broken down not only by sex but also by region (urban/rural), by age group, by
  educational level, by labour force status, and by occupation.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>None. ITU uses the data provided by countries, including the in-scope
  population that is used to calculate the percentages.</p>
