  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The proportion of individuals who own a mobile telephone, by sex is defined
  as the &#x2018;proportion of individuals who own a mobile telephone, by
  sex&#x2019;.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>An individual owns a mobile cellular phone if he/she has a mobile cellular
  phone device with at least one active SIM card for personal use. Mobile
  cellular phones supplied by employers that can be used for personal reasons
  (to make personal calls, access the Internet, etc.) are included. Individuals
  who have only active SIM card(s) and not a mobile phone device are excluded.
  Individuals who have a mobile phone for personal use that is not registered
  under his/her name are also included. An active SIM card is a SIM card that
  has been used in the last three months.</p>

  <p>A mobile (cellular) telephone refers to a portable telephone subscribing to
  a public mobile telephone service using cellular technology, which provides
  access to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). This includes analogue
  and digital cellular systems and technologies such as IMT-2000 (3G) and
  IMT-Advanced. Users of both postpaid subscriptions and prepaid accounts are
  included.</p>
UNIT_MEASURE: <p>Percent (%) (of individuals)</p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>For countries that collect this data through an official survey, and if
  data allow breakdown and disaggregation, the indicator can be broken down by
  region (urban/rural), sex, age group, educational level (International
  Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) ), by labour force status
  (International Labour Organization (ILO)), and by occupation (International
  Standard Classification of Occupation (ISCO)). The International
  Telecommunication Union (ITU)) collects data for all these breakdowns from
  countries.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>This indicator is a newly developed International Telecommunication Union
  (ITU) indicator that was approved by the World Telecommunication/ICT
  Indicators Symposium (WTIS) in 2014. The indicator&#x2019;s definition and
  methodology were developed under the coordination of ITU, through its Expert
  Groups, and following an extensive consultation process with countries. Data
  for the proportion of individuals owning a mobile phone were first collected
  in 2015 through an annual questionnaire that ITU sends to National Statistical
  Offices (NSO). In this questionnaire, through which ITU already collects
  several ICT indicators, ITU collects absolute values. The percentages are
  calculated a-posteriori. The survey methodology is verified to ensure that it
  meets adequate statistical standards. The data are verified to ensure
  consistency with previous years&#x2019; data and other relevant country-level
  indicators (ICT and economic).</p>

  <p>Data are usually not adjusted, but discrepancies in the definition, age
  scope of individuals, reference period, or the break in comparability between
  years are noted in a data note. For this reason, data are not always strictly
  comparable.</p>

  questionnaire.</p>

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Mobile phone networks have spread rapidly over the last decade and the
  number of mobile-cellular subscriptions is quasi equal to the number of people
  living on earth. However, not every person uses or owns a mobile-cellular
  telephone. Mobile phone ownership, in particular, is important to track gender
  equality since the mobile phone is a personal device that, if owned and not
  just shared, provides women with a degree of independence and autonomy,
  including for professional purposes. Several studies have highlighted the link
  between mobile phone ownership and empowerment, and productivity growth.</p>

  <p>Existing data on the proportion of women owning a mobile phone suggest that
  fewer women than men own a mobile phone. This indicator highlights the
  importance of mobile phone ownership to track and improve gender equality, and
  monitoring will help design targeted policies to overcome the gender divide.
  The collection of this indicator was proposed by the Task Group on Gender of
  the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>While the data on the &#x2018;proportion of individuals who own a mobile
  telephone&#x2019; currently only exist for very few countries, ITU is
  encouraging all countries to collect data on this indicator through national
  household surveys and the indicator is expected to be added to the Partnership
  on Measuring ICT for Development&#x2019;s Core List of Indicators. The number
  of countries with official data for this indicator is expected to increase in
  the near future.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Countries can collect data on this indicator through national household
  surveys. This indicator is calculated by dividing the total number of in-scope
  individuals who own a mobile phone by the total number of in-scope
  individuals.</p>

DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>Data are submitted by Member States to The International Telecommunication
  Union (ITU). ITU checks and validates the data, in consultation with the
  Member States. </p>
ADJUSTMENT: <p>No adjustments are made to the data submitted by countries.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>

  <p>Missing values are not estimated. </p>

  <p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>

  <p>In the absence of official household surveys, International
  Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimates the percentage of individuals owning
  mobile phones (owners of mobile phones as a percentage of total population)
  using various techniques, such as hot-deck imputation, regression models and
  time series forecast, using data such as Internet use, income, education and
  other ICT indicators.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Country-level data on the percentage of individuals owning mobile phones
  (owners of mobile phones as a percentage of total population) are first
  estimated using various techniques, such as hot-deck imputation, regression
  models and time series forecast. Hot-deck imputation uses data from countries
  with &#x201C;similar&#x201D; characteristics, such as GNI per capita and
  geographic location. In cases when it is not possible to find an adequate
  imputation based on similar cases, regression models are applied.</p>

  <p>Once the country-level percentages are available for all countries, the
  number of mobile phone owners are calculated by multiplying the percentages to
  the population of the country. The regional and world total mobile phone
  owners were calculated by summing the country-level data. The aggregate
  percentages were calculated by dividing the regional totals by the population
  of respective groups.</p>

COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>Overall, the indicator is available for more than 80 countries at least
  from one survey.</p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>2015 onwards</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>For countries that collect this indicator through a national household
  survey, and if data allow breakdown and disaggregation, the indicator can be
  broken down not only by sex but also by region (urban/rural), age group,
  educational level, labour force status, and occupation. Estimates of regional
  aggregates by sex are also calculated.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>None. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) uses the data
  provided by countries, including the in-scope population that is used to
  calculate the percentages.</p>
