  <h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>

  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator is defined as the total count of victims of intentional
  homicide divided by the total population, expressed per 100,000
  population.</p>

  <p>Intentional homicide is defined as the unlawful death inflicted upon a
  person with the intent to cause death or serious injury (Source: International
  Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes, ICCS 2015); population
  refers to total resident population in a given country in a given year.</p>

  <h2>Concepts:</h2>

  <p>In the ICCS intentional homicide is defined as the &#x2018;&#x2018;Unlawful
  death inflicted upon a person with the intent to cause death or serious
  injury&#x201D;. This definition contains three elements characterizing the
  killing of a person as intentional homicide:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The killing of a person by another person (objective element);</li>
    <li>The intent of the perpetrator to kill or seriously injure the victim (subjective element);</li>
    <li>The unlawfulness of the killing, which means that the law considers the perpetrator liable for the unlawful death (legal element).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This definition states that, for statistical purposes, all killings
  corresponding to the three criteria above should be considered as intentional
  homicides, irrespective of definitions provided by national legislations or
  practices.</p>

  <h1>Data sources</h1>

  <h2>Description:</h2>

  <p>Two separate sources exist at country level: a) criminal justice system; b)
  public health/civil registration. UNODC collects and publishes data from
  criminal justice systems through its long-lasting annual data collection
  mandated by the UN General Assembly (UN Crime Trends Survey, UN-CTS); WHO
  collects and publishes data produced by public health/civil registration. The
  data collection through the UN-CTS is facilitated by a network of over 130
  national Focal Points appointed by responsible authorities.</p>

  <p>Currently, when national data on homicide are not available from neither of
  the two types of source above, estimates produced by WHO are used.</p>

  <p>UNODC and WHO are working together to develop a common approach to produce
  joint UNODC-WHO homicide data series at country, regional and global
  level.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p><strong>Collection process:</strong></p>

  <p>At international level, data on intentional homicides are routinely
  collected by UNODC through the annual UN-CTS data collection. As requested by
  the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, over 130 Member
  States have already appointed a UN-CTS national focal point that delivers
  UN-CTS data to UNODC. In most cases these focal points are national
  institutions responsible for data production in the area of crime and criminal
  justice (National Statistical Offices, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of
  Justice, etc.). For countries that have not appointed a focal point, the
  request for data is sent to permanent missions in Vienna. When a country does
  not report to UNODC, other official sources such as authoritative websites,
  publications, or other forms of communication are used. Homicide estimates
  from WHO are currently used when no other source on homicide is available.
  Once consolidated, data are shared to countries to check their accuracy.</p>

  <p>When data and related metadata are available, some adjustments are made to
  data in order to assure compliance with the definition of intentional homicide
  as provided by the ICCS. National data on types of killings that are
  considered as intentional homicide by the ICCS, while being classified under a
  different crime at country level, are added to national figures of intentional
  homicide. This can be done only when detailed data on such types of killings
  (e.g. serious assault leading to death, honor killing, etc.) are
  available.</p>

  <p>As for UNODC data dissemination policy, data for SDG monitoring will be
  sent to countries for consultation prior to publication.</p>

  <p>United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC),WHO</p>

  <h2>Description:</h2>

  <p>At international level, data on intentional homicides are routinely
  collected and disseminated by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime
  (UNODC) through the annual UN-Crime Trend Survey (CTS) data collection. UNODC
  partners with regional organizations in the collection and dissemination of
  homicide data, respectively with Eurostat in Europe and with the Organisation
  of American States in the Americas. WHO collects data on intentional homicide
  in the framework of regular data collection on causes of death . In this
  context, data on deaths by assault are considered as intentional
  homicides.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <h2>Rationale:</h2>

  <p>This indicator is widely used at national and international level to
  measure the most extreme form of violent crime and it also provides a direct
  indication of lack of security. Security from violence is a pre-requisite for
  individuals to enjoy a safe and active life and for societies and economies to
  develop freely. Intentional homicides occur in all countries of the world and
  this indicator has a global applicability.</p>

  <p>Monitoring intentional homicides is necessary to better assess their
  causes, drivers and consequences and, in the longer term, to develop effective
  preventive measures. If data are properly disaggregated (as suggested in the
  ICCS), the indicator can identify the different type of violence associated
  with homicide: inter-personal (including partner and family-related violence),
  crime (including organized crime and other forms of criminal activities) and
  socio-political (including terrorism, hate crime).</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>

  <p>The ICCS provides important clarifications on the definition of intentional
  homicide. In particular, it states that the following killings are included in
  the count of homicide:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Murder</li>
    <li>Honour killing</li>
    <li>Serious assault leading to death</li>
    <li>Death as a result of terrorist activities</li>
    <li>Dowry-related killings</li>
    <li>Femicide</li>
    <li>Infanticide</li>
    <li>Voluntary manslaughter</li>
    <li>Extrajudicial killings</li>
    <li>Killings caused by excessive force by law enforcement/state officials</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Furthermore, the ICCS provides indications on how to distinguish between
  intentional homicides, killings directly related to war/conflict and other
  killings that amount to war crimes.</p>

  <p>The fact that homicide data are typically produced by two separate and
  independent sources at national level (criminal justice and public health)
  represents a specific asset of this indicator, as the comparison of the two
  sources is a tool to assess accuracy of national data. Usually, for countries
  where data from both sources exist, a good level of matching between the
  sources is recorded (see UNODC Global Study on Homicide, 2013).</p>

  <p>Data on homicides produced by public health authorities are guided by the
  International classification of diseases (ICD-10), which provides a definition
  of &#x2018;Death by assault&#x2019; that is very close to the definition of
  intentional homicide of the ICCS.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <h1>Methodology</h1>

  <h2>Computation method:</h2>

  <p>The indicator is calculated as the total number of victims of intentional
  homicide recorded in a given year divided by the total resident population in
  the same year, multiplied by 100,000.</p>

  <p>In several countries, two separate sets of data on intentional homicide are
  produced, respectively from criminal justice and public health/civil
  registration systems. When existing, figures from both data sources are
  reported. Population data are derived from annual estimates produced by the UN
  Population Division.</p>

  <h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>WHO produces estimates for countries where national data on homicide are
  not available from neither criminal justice nor from public health/civil
  registration. These estimates are used when compiling the global dataset and
  produce estimates of missing values (for information on the methodology, see
  WHO-UNDP-UNODC, Global Status Report on Violence Prevention 2014).</p>

  <h1>Data availability</h1>

  <h2>Description:</h2>

  <p>Considering data collected by both UNODC and WHO, national data on homicide
  are available for 174 countries (at least one data point between 2009-2013) .
  Time series data on homicide suitable for monitoring are available for 141
  countries (at least 3 data points, the most recent between 2011-2013).</p>

  <h2><strong>Time series</strong>:</h2>

  <p>2010-2014 </p>

  <h2>Disaggregation:</h2>

  <p>Recommended disaggregation for this indicator are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>sex and age of the victim and the perpetrator (suspected offender)</li>
    <li>relationship between victim and perpetrator (intimate partner, other family member, acquaintance, etc.)</li>
    <li>means of perpetration (firearm, blunt object, etc.)</li>
    <li>situational context/motivation (organized crime, intimate partner violence, etc.)</li>
  </ul>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>

  <p>Discrepancies might exist between country produced and internationally
  reported counts of intentional homicides as national data might refer to
  national definition of intentional homicide while data reported by UNODC aim
  to comply with the definition provided by the ICCS (approved in 2015 by Member
  States in the UN Statistical Commission and the UN Commission on Crime
  Prevention and Criminal Justice). UNODC makes special efforts to count all
  killings falling under the ICCS definition of intentional homicide, while
  national data may still be compiled according to national legal systems rather
  than the statistical classification. . The gradual implementation of ICCS by
  countries should improve quality and consistency of national and international
  data.</p>

  <p>Intentional homicide rates may also differ due to the use of different
  population figures.</p>
