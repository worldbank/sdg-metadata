  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator is defined as the total count of victims of intentional
  homicide divided by the total population, expressed per 100,000
  population.</p>

  <p>Intentional homicide is defined as the unlawful death inflicted upon a
  person with the intent to cause death or serious injury (Source: International
  Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes, ICCS 2015); population
  refers to total resident population in a given country in a given year.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>The International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS)
  is the source of the definition of intentional homicide.</p>

  <p>Intentional homicide (ICCS 0101): Unlawful death inflicted upon a person
  with the intent to cause death or serious injury.</p>

  <p>The statistical definition contains three elements that characterize the
  killing of a person as &#x201C;intentional homicide&#x201D;:</p>

  <p>1. The killing of a person by another person (objective element);</p>

  <p>2. The intent of the perpetrator to kill or seriously injure the victim
  (subjective element);</p>

  <p>3. The unlawfulness of the killing, which means that the law considers the
  perpetrator liable for the unlawful death (legal element).</p>

  <p>This definition states that, for statistical purposes, all killings
  corresponding to the three criteria above should be considered as intentional
  homicides, irrespective of definitions provided by national legislations or
  practices.</p>

  <p>In the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), deaths coded with
  ICD-10 codes X85-Y09 (injuries inflicted by another person with intent to
  injure or kill) and ICD-10 code Y87.1 (sequelae of assault), or ICD-11 codes
  PD50-PF2Z and PJ20-PJ2Z, generally correspond to the definition of intentional
  homicide discussed above.</p>

  <p>Two separate sources exist at country level: a) criminal justice system; b)
  civil registration/vital statistics. The United Nations Office on Drugs and
  Crime (UNODC) collects and publishes data from criminal justice systems
  through its annual data collection mandated by the UN General Assembly (UN
  Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems, UN-CTS);
  the World Health Organization (WHO) collects and publishes death certificate
  data (civil registration/vital statistics). The data collection through the
  UN-CTS is facilitated by a network of over 140 national Focal Points appointed
  by responsible authorities.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>At international level, data on intentional homicides are routinely
  collected by UNODC through the annual UN Survey of Crime Trends and Operations
  of Criminal Justice Systems (UN-CTS) data collection. As requested by the UN
  Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, over 140 Member States
  have already appointed a UN-CTS national focal point that delivers UN-CTS data
  to UNODC. In most cases these focal points are national institutions
  responsible for data production in the area of crime and criminal justice
  (National Statistical Offices, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Justice,
  etc.). For countries that have not appointed a focal point, the request for
  data is sent to permanent missions in Vienna. When a country does not report
  to UNODC, other official sources such as authoritative websites, publications,
  or other forms of communication are used. Homicide estimates from WHO are used
  when no other source on homicide is available. Once consolidated, data are
  shared to countries to check their accuracy.</p>

  <p>When data and related metadata are available, some adjustments are made to
  data in order to assure compliance with the definition of intentional homicide
  as provided by the International Classification of Crime for Statistical
  Purposes (ICCS). National data on types of killings that are considered as
  intentional homicide by the ICCS, while being classified under a different
  crime at country level, are added to national figures of intentional homicide.
  This can be done only when detailed data on such types of killings (e.g.
  serious assault leading to death, honor killing, etc.) are available.</p>

  <p>As for UNODC data dissemination policy, data for SDG monitoring are sent to
  countries for consultation prior to publication. </p>

  <p>Data on intentional homicide are sent to UNODC by member states, usually

  Systems (UN-CTS) Focal Points, which in most cases are national institutions
  responsible for data production in the area of crime and criminal justice
  (National Statistical Offices, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Justice,
  etc.). The primary source on intentional homicide is usually an institution of
  the criminal justice system (Police, Ministry of Interior, general Prosecutor
  Office, etc.). Data produced by public health/civil registration system are
  sent to WHO through national statistics offices and/or ministries of
  health.</p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

  <p>At international level, data on intentional homicides are routinely
  collected and disseminated by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime
  (UNODC) through the annual UN Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of
  Criminal Justice Systems (UN-CTS) data collection. UNODC partners with
  regional organizations in the collection and dissemination of homicide data,
  respectively with Eurostat in Europe and with the Organisation of American
  States in the Americas. WHO collects data on intentional homicide in the
  framework of regular data collection on causes of death. In this context, data
  on deaths by assault are considered as intentional homicides.</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal
  Justice Systems (UN-CTS) was introduced through the General Assembly
  Resolution <a
  href="https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/3021(XXVII)">A/RES/3021(XXVII)</a> in 1972.
  The Economic and Social Council, in its resolution 1984/48 of 25 May 1984,
  requested that the Secretary-General maintain and develop the United Nations
  crime-related database by continuing to conduct surveys of crime trends and
  the operations of criminal justice systems. </p>

  <p>According to Article 64 of its constitution, WHO is mandated to request
  each Member State to provide statistics on mortality. In support of this, the
  first World Health Assembly endorsed the sixth revision of the International
  List of Causes of Death, now called the International Statistical
  Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of death (ICD). The <a
  href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/89478/WHA20.18_eng.pdf"
  target="_blank">WHO Nomenclature Regulations</a> of 1967 affirms the
  importance of compiling and publishing statistics of mortality and morbidity
  in comparable form. Member States are obliged to provide WHO with the
  statistics in accordance with the Regulations.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>This indicator is widely used at national and international level to
  measure the most extreme form of violent crime and it also provides a direct
  indication of lack of security. Security from violence is a pre-requisite for
  individuals to enjoy a safe and active life and for societies and economies to
  develop freely. Intentional homicides occur in all countries of the world and
  this indicator has a global applicability.</p>

  <p>Monitoring intentional homicides is necessary to better assess their
  causes, drivers and consequences and, in the longer term, to develop effective
  preventive measures. If data are properly disaggregated (as suggested in the
  International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes), the indicator
  can identify the different type of violence associated with homicide:
  inter-personal (including partner and family-related violence), crime
  (including organized crime and other forms of criminal activities) and
  socio-political (including terrorism, hate crime).</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS)
  provides important clarifications on the definition of intentional homicide.
  In particular, it states that the following killings are included in the count
  of homicide:</p>

  <p>- Murder</p>

  <p>- Honour killing</p>

  <p>- Serious assault leading to death</p>

  <p>- Death as a result of terrorist activities</p>

  <p>- Dowry-related killings</p>

  <p>- Femicide</p>

  <p>- Infanticide</p>

  <p>- Voluntary manslaughter</p>

  <p>- Extrajudicial killings</p>

  <p>- Killings caused by excessive force by law enforcement/state officials</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the <a
  href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/crime/ICCS/Unlawful_killings_conflict_situations_ICCS.pdf">ICCS
  Briefing Note on Unlawful killings in conflict situations</a> provides
  indications on how to distinguish between intentional homicides, killings
  directly related to war/conflict and other killings that amount to war
  crimes.</p>

  <p>The complete recording of homicide deaths in death-registration systems
  requires good linkages with coronial and police systems, but can be impeded by
  delays in determining intent of injury deaths. Less than one half of WHO
  Member States have well-functioning death-registration systems that record
  causes of death. </p>

  <p>The fact that homicide data are typically produced by two separate and
  independent sources at national level (criminal justice and public health)
  represents a specific asset of this indicator, as the comparison of the two
  sources is a tool to assess accuracy of national data. Usually, for countries
  where data from both sources exist, a good level of matching between the
  sources is recorded (see UNODC Global Study on Homicide, 2013).</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The indicator is calculated as the total number of victims of intentional
  homicide recorded in a given year divided by the total resident population in
  the same year, multiplied by 100,000.</p>

  <p>For the rate by sex, the number of victims of that sex should be divided by
  the population of the same sex. </p>

  <p>In several countries, two separate sets of data on intentional homicide are
  produced, respectively from criminal justice and public health/civil
  registration systems. When existing, figures from both data sources are
  reported. Population data are derived from annual estimates produced by the UN
  Population Division.</p>

  <p>In cases where data on intentional homicide victims are not available, the
  number of intentional homicide offences, that is the number of incidents
  involving one or more victims recorded by the police, can be used as a
  proxy.</p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>Following the submission of the CTS questionnaire, UNODC checks for
  consistency and coherence with other data sources. Member States which are
  also part of the European Union or the European Free Trade Association, or
  candidate or potential candidate to the European Union are sending their
  response to the UN-CTS to Eurostat for validation. The Organization for
  American States is also reviewing the responses of its Member States. All data
  submitted by Member States through other means or taken from other sources are
  added to the dataset after review and validation by Member States. </p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>

  <p>When national data on victims of intentional homicide are not available
  from neither criminal justice nor from public health/civil registration, the
  number of intentional homicide offences is considered. If no data are
  available, missing values are left blank.</p>

  <p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>

  <p>See section 4.g. Regional aggregations for more information. </p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>The method used for estimating the number of victims of intentional
  homicides at the global and regional level aims to make the best possible use
  of available data. For each regional aggregate, the number of victims of
  intentional homicides should correspond to the sum of all national data of
  such killings in the region, in each year. However, for many countries, data
  on intentional homicides are not available, or data are available only for
  some years. As a result, the sample of countries with available data is
  different for each year. If left unaddressed, this issue would result in
  inconsistencies, as regional aggregates would be drawn from a different set of
  countries each year.</p>

  <p>Imputations for intentional homicides victims are performed on the
  country-level rate of intentional homicide victims per 100,000 population. If
  a country has just one available data point since the year 2000, all missing
  values are set equal to this single available data point. This approach
  therefore accounts for population growth over time and does not mean that the
  series is constant in absolute terms. If a country has two to eight available
  data points, the missing values between two data points are estimated by
  linear interpolation, and if there are missing values that are temporally
  before (or after) the earliest (or latest) available data point, the values at
  the beginning (or end) of the series are filled with the earliest (or latest)
  available data point. If a country has more than eight available data points
  in the respective time series, the missing values between two data points are
  estimated by linear interpolation, and if there are missing values that are
  temporally before (or after) the earliest (or latest) available data point,
  the values at the end of the time series are imputed using an exponential
  smoothing approach (for more information, see <a
  href="https://afit-r.github.io/ts_exp_smoothing">this page</a>). Finally, the
  regional rate is applied to countries without any data point </p>

  <p>Once the series have been imputed at the national level, they are
  aggregated at the regional level. Regional homicide totals are calculated for
  each year by multiplying the regional homicide rate per 100,000 population
  with the total population of the respective region (divided by 100,000). The
  regions are the ones from the United Nations &#x201C;<a
  href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/">Standard Country or Area
  Codes for Statistical Use</a>&#x201D;. Each country or area is included in one
  region only.</p>

  <p>Finally, regional estimates are aggregated to compute the global number of
  intentional homicides. </p>

QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>UNODC developed a quality assessment score for homicide data at country
  level. Based on a set of standard quality dimensions for statistical data, a
  quality assessment framework was developed to evaluate global homicide data
  based on five main criteria:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Comparability</li>
    <li>Completeness</li>
    <li>Timeliness</li>
    <li>Internal Consistency</li>
    <li>External Consistency</li>
  </ol>

  <p>For each of these criteria quality indicators are defined and a qualitative
  score is computed per country (on a scale of 0-100), which is then converted
  to a qualitative score in three categories (good; fair; low). A total score
  encompasses all five criteria.</p>

  <p>More information on the quality assessment score can be found in the <a
  href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/gsh/Meth_Annex_GHS.pdf">methodological
  annex</a> of the 2019 Global Study on Homicide. The next update data quality
  assessment will be presented in the 2023 Global Study on Homicide.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>Considering data collected by both UNODC and WHO, national data on homicide
  are available for most Member States. However, data availability is lower in
  Africa, Asia and the Pacific and Western Asia than in the Americas and Europe.
  Furthermore, data availability for crucial disaggregations (by sex, or
  victim-perpetrator relationship) is more limited than for total homicide
  counts.</p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>1990-present day</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>Recommended disaggregation for this indicator are:</p>

  <p>- sex and age of the victim and the perpetrator (suspected offender)</p>

  <p>- relationship between victim and perpetrator (intimate partner, other
  family member, acquaintance, etc.)</p>

  <p>- means of perpetration (firearm, sharp object, etc.)</p>

  <p>- situational context/motivation (organized crime, inter-personal violence,
  etc.)</p>

  <p>Tables III, IV and V of the International Classification of Crime for
  Statistical Purposes contains more information on these disaggregations,
  including definitions for each of the categories.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>Discrepancies might exist between country produced and internationally
  reported counts of intentional homicides as national data might refer to
  national definition of intentional homicide while data reported by UNODC aim
  to comply with the definition provided by the International Classification of
  Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) (approved in 2015 by Member States in
  the UN Statistical Commission and the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and
  Criminal Justice). The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) makes
  special efforts to count all killings falling under the ICCS definition of
  intentional homicide, while national data may still be compiled according to
  national legal systems rather than the statistical classification. The gradual
  implementation of ICCS by countries should improve quality and consistency of
  national and international data.</p>

  <p>Intentional homicide rates may also differ due to the use of different
  population figures.</p>
