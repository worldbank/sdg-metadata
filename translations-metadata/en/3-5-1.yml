  <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>

  <p>The coverage of treatment interventions for substance use disorders is
  defined as the number of people who received treatment in a year divided by
  the total number of people with substance use disorders in the same year. This
  indicator is disaggregated by two broad groups of psychoactive substances: (1)
  drugs, (2) alcohol and other psychoactive substances. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Whenever possible, this indicator is additionally disaggregated by type of
  treatment interventions (pharmacological, psychosocial and rehabilitation and
  aftercare services). The proposed indicator will be accompanied, with
  contextual information on availability coverage, i.e. treatment capacity for
  substance use disorders generated at national level to provide additional
  information for interpretation of the contact coverage data. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts: </strong></p>

  <p>The central concept of &#x201C;substance abuse&#x201D; in the SDG health
  target 3.5 implies the use of psychoactive substances that, when taken in or
  administered into one&apos;s system, affect mental processes, e.g. perception,
  consciousness, cognition or affect. The concept of &#x201C;substance use
  disorders&#x201D; includes both &#x201C;drugs use disorders&#x201D; and
  &#x201C;alcohol use disorders&#x201D; according to the <a
  href="https://icd.who.int/browse10/2016/en" target="_blank">International
  Classification of Diseases (ICD-10 and ICD-11)</a>. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>The term &#x201C;drugs&#x201D; refers to controlled psychoactive substances
  as scheduled by the three <a
  href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/commissions/CND/conventions.html"
  target="_blank">Drug Control Conventions (1961, 1971 and 1988)</a>, substances
  controlled under national legislation and new psychoactive substances (NPS)
  that are not controlled under the Conventions, but may pose a public health
  threat. &#x201C;Alcohol&#x201D; refers to ethanol - a psychoactive substance
  with dependence producing properties that is consumed in ethanol-based or
  alcoholic beverages. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>People with substance use disorders are those with harmful substance use
  and/or affected by substance dependence. Harmful substance use is defined in
  the ICD-11 as a pattern of use of substances that has caused damage to a
  person&#x2019;s physical or mental health or has resulted in behaviour leading
  to harm to the health of others. According to ICD-11, dependence arises from
  repeated or continuous use of psychoactive substances. The characteristic
  feature is a strong internal drive to use psychoactive substance, which is
  manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasing priority given to
  use over other activities and persistence of use despite harm or negative
  consequences. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Treatment of substance use disorder -any structured intervention that is
  aimed specifically to a) reduce substance use and cravings for substance use;
  b) improve health, well-being and social functioning of the affected
  individual, and c) prevent future harms by decreasing the risk of
  complications and relapse. These may include pharmacological treatment,
  psychosocial interventions and rehabilitation and aftercare. All
  evidence-based used for treatment of substance use disorders are well defined
  in WHO and UNODC related documents. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><u>Pharmacological treatment</u> refers to interventions that include
  detoxification, opioid agonist maintenance therapy (OAMT) and antagonist
  maintenance (WHO, UNODC International Standards for the treatment of drug use
  disorders, 2016). </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><u>Psychosocial interventions</u> refer to programs that address
  motivational, behavioral, psychological, social, and environmental factors
  related to substance use and have been shown to reduce drug use, promote
  abstinence and prevent relapse. For different drug use disorders, the evidence
  from clinical trials supports the effectiveness of treatment planning,
  screening, counselling, peer support groups, cognitive behavioral therapy
  (CBT), motivational interviewing (MI), community reinforcement approach (CRA),
  motivational enhancement therapy (MET), family therapy (FT) modalities,
  contingency management (CM), counselling, insight-oriented treatments, housing
  and employment support among others. (UNODC WHO International Standards for
  the Treatment of Drug Use Disorders, 2016). </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><u>Rehabilitation and aftercare</u> (Recovery Management and Social
  Support) refers to interventions that are based on scientific evidence and
  focused on the process of rehabilitation, recovery and social reintegration
  dedicated to treat drug use disorders. </p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The sources include: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Household surveys </li>
    <li>Surveys among people using substances &#x2013; using for instance respondent driven sampling </li>
    <li>Indirect methods such as capture/recapture or multiplier benchmark method </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Surveys should be nationally representative, with a sample size
  sufficiently large to capture relevant events and compute needed
  disaggregation, and they should be based on a solid sample design. The use of
  indirect questions for network scale-up methods in household surveys is
  encouraged. </p>

  <p>Treatment registries are the main source of data for the number of people
  receiving treatment. They should cover the entire national territory and be
  linked to all relevant agencies providing treatment services. </p>

  <p>To estimate the number of people with alcohol use disorders, preferred data
  sources are population-based surveys targeting the adult population (15+
  years). International surveys such as WHS, STEPS, GENACIS, and ECAS represent
  good practices. </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>WHO and UNODC will use existing data collections to gather available
  statistics from member states: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>UNODC Annual Report Questionnaire ; </li>
    <li>WHO Global Survey on Progress on SDG Health Target 3.5; </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Drugs: </strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Data on people with drug use disorders and the number of people in treatment are collected through a standardised questionnaire sent to countries, the Annual Report Questionnaire (ARQ). This questionnaire provides specific definitions of data to be collected and it collects a set of metadata to identify possible discrepancies from standard definitions and to assess overall data quality (e.g. sample size, target population, agency responsible for the data collection, etc.). At the national level, countries are required to have standardized treatment reporting system. </li>
    <li>A revised ARQ will be used from 2021 onwards. Data on drug use disorders and treatment, with the relevant disaggregations will continue to be collected through this tool. </li>
    <li>Countries will be requested to nominate national focal points to ensure technical supervision at country level </li>
    <li>Automated and substantive validation procedures are in place to assess data consistency and compliance with standards </li>
    <li>When data from national official sources are missing or not complying with methodological standards, data from other sources are also considered and processed by using the same quality assurance procedures. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Alcohol and other substances: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>In the periodical WHO Global Surveys on Alcohol and Health, alcohol focal points officially nominated by the Ministry of Health provide data or links or contacts through which the data can be accessed. </li>
    <li>These focal points provide national government statistics. </li>
    <li>In addition, data are accessed from country-specific industry data sources in the public domain and other databases as well as systematic literature reviews. </li>
    <li>WHO global surveillance activities generate population-based country data used for estimation of the number of people with substance use disorders in populations (such as World Mental Health Survey and STEPS surveys) </li>
    <li>Data on service utilization and contextual information are being collected by WHO Global Survey on SDG 3.5 that has been previously piloted and through specific activities such as service mapping surveys implemented in collaboration with UNOD </li>
    <li>The collected, collated and analysed data is included in the process of country consultations. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>After the validation process, the data will be sent to national focal
  points for their review before publication. </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>Countries are encouraged to conduct general population surveys on substance
  use regularly, but at least every four-five years. Also, countries are
  encouraged to use less costly alternatives to estimate the number of people
  with substance use disorders and service utilization, taking advantage of the
  availability of administrative data through the use of indirect estimation
  methods. Collection of data from countries is planned on annual or biannual
  basis. </p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>Data on relevant SDG indicators are collected, compiled and sent back to
  countries for data review annually. Data are then reported to UNSD through the
  regular reporting channels annually. </p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>Drug use disorders data are collected through national focal points. Data
  providers vary by country and they can be institutions such as Drug Control
  Agencies, National Drug Observatories, Ministries of Health and/or National
  Statistical Offices. </p>
COMPILING_ORG: >-
  <p>Data will be compiled by the co-custodians for this indicator (UNODC and
  WHO). </p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>According to UNODC and WHO data, around 271 million people aged 15 to 64
  years worldwide used an illicit drug at least once in 2017, about 2.3 billion
  people are current drinkers of alcohol, some 35 million of people suffer from
  drug use disorders and 289 million from alcohol use disorders. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Substance use disorders are serious health conditions that present a
  significant burden for affected individuals, their families and communities.
  Untreated substance use disorders trigger substantial costs to society
  including lost productivity, increased health care expenditure, and costs
  related to criminal justice, social welfare, and other social consequences.
  Strengthening treatment services entails providing access to a comprehensive
  set of evidence-based interventions (-laid down in the international standards
  and guidelines) that should be available to all population groups in need. The
  indicator will inform the extent to which a range of evidence-based
  interventions for treatment of substance use disorder are available and are
  accessed by the population in need at country, regional and global level. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Even though effective treatment exists, only a small amount of people with
  substance use disorders receive it. For instance, it is estimated that
  globally one out of 7 people with drug use disorders have access to or
  provided drug treatment services (World Drug Report 2019). <a
  href="https://www.who.int/gho/substance_abuse/en/" target="_blank">WHO
  ATLAS-Substance Use</a> data showed that in 2014 only 11.9 % (out of 103
  responding) countries reported high coverage (40% or more) for alcohol
  dependence. SDG indicator 3.5.1 is crucial for measurement the progress
  towards strengthening the treatment of substance abuse worldwide as formulated
  in the Target 3.5. </p>

  <p> </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The two main challenges in terms of computing the SDG 3.5.1 indicator are
  the limited availability of household surveys on substance use and the
  under-reporting of use among survey respondents. </p>

  <p>Data reported from household surveys are one of the sources of information
  on of the number of people with substance use disorders. There are issues of
  under-reporting for certain psychoactive substances, in countries where stigma
  is associated to substance use and when a considerable proportion of the drug
  or alcohol using population is institutionalized, homeless or unreachable by
  population-based surveys. Additionally, being a relatively rare event,
  household surveys on substance use disorders require a large sample and can be
  costly. In order to address these issues, additional approaches (e.g. scale up
  methods) are increasingly used in household surveys to address undercount
  issues. These can be used in conjunction with special studies and/or
  additional information, in order to obtain reasonable estimates via indirect
  methods, such as benchmark/multiplier or capture-recapture methods. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>An additional step in data validation and country capacity building for
  monitoring treatment coverage for substance use disorders will be implemented
  during the next couple of years for in-depth data generation in a sample of
  countries from different regions and representing different levels of health
  system development. A rapid assessment tool for in-depth data generation is in
  the process of development by WHO. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>The indicator stresses on type, availability and coverage of services but
  does not necessarily provide information on the actual quality of the
  interventions/services provided. To address this, at national level, the
  proposed treatment indicator will be accompanied with contextual information
  on availability coverage, i.e. treatment capacity for substance use disorders
  to provide additional information for interpretation of the contact coverage
  data. </p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The indicator will be computed by dividing the number of people receiving
  treatment services at least once in a year by the total number of people with
  substance use disorders in the same year: </p>

IMPUTATION: >-
  <p><strong>At country level </strong></p>

  <p>For drug use disorder, data will be provided for countries where
  information is available for both numerator and denominator. No data estimates
  will be done at the national level. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>For alcohol, when information on service utilization is missing in a
  country, several approaches will be used to produce estimates based on all
  available pieces of contextual service capacity data in the country and
  regionally. Link to be established between service availability and service
  utilization to get rough understanding on number of people who might be using
  services for countries where no direct information on number of people using
  services is available at all. </p>

  <p><strong> </strong></p>

  <p><strong>At regional and global level </strong></p>

  <p>Sub-regional and regional aggregates are produced when enough data at the
  country level are available (a minimum number of countries and a minimum
  percentage of population coverage). When data are available, sub-regional
  estimates are created first and then aggregated at regional level. The global
  level is computed as aggregation of regional estimates. </p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>UNODC has published a series of methodological guidelines on several issues
  related to the drug problem, entitled &#x201C;Global Assessment Program
  (GAP)&#x201D;. These guidelines consist of 8 modules, covering different
  aspects of monitoring the drug situation including setting up drug information
  systems, estimating drug prevalence using indirect methods, setting up
  treatment monitoring and reporting systems, etc. The modules can be found at:
  <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/GAP/"
  target="_blank">https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/GAP/</a>. It is planned to
  update these guidelines in the near future. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>As part of the ARQ review process, UNODC is planning to enhance its
  capacity building tools by complementing regional and national capacity
  building activities with: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>E-learning training modules with incorporated training curricula </li>
    <li>Creating methodological guidelines and tools on drug-related issues, including drug use disorders and treatment </li>
    <li>promoting national coordination mechanisms on drugs data, including national drug observatories </li>
  </ul>

  <p>WHO has published series of documents on alcohol monitoring in populations
  (e.g. International Guide for Monitoring Alcohol Consumption and Related
  Harm), and established a <a
  href="https://www.who.int/substance_abuse/activities/gisah/en/"
  target="_blank">Global Information System on Alcohol and Health (GISAH)</a>
  that provides easy and rapid access to a wide range of alcohol-related health
  indicators. It is an essential tool for assessing and monitoring the health
  situation and trends related to alcohol consumption, alcohol-related harm, and
  policy responses in countries. GISAH is a further development of the Global
  Alcohol Database which has been built since 1997 by the WHO Department of
  Mental Health and Substance Abuse. The main purpose of GISAH is to serve WHO
  Member States and governmental and nongovernmental organizations by making
  alcohol-related health data available. These data can help to analyse the
  state of the health situation related to alcohol in a country, a WHO region or
  sub-region, or the world. <a
  href="https://www.who.int/substance_abuse/activities/gisah_indicatorbook.pdf?ua=1"
  target="_blank">The Indicator Code Book</a> has been prepared to assist
  countries in collecting the data. </p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>At UNODC, quality assurance measures are in place to collect, process and
  disseminate statistical data. They build on the &#x2018;Principles governing
  international statistical activities&#x2019; and regulate the collection,
  processing, publication and dissemination of data. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>All data for SDG indicators as compiled by the Office are sent to countries
  (through the relevant national focal points) for their review before
  statistical data are officially released by UNODC. When countries provide
  feedback/comments on the data, a technical discussion is conducted to identify
  a common position. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>At WHO quality assurance measures are in place for producing the health
  statistics that include the main indicators on alcohol consumption and its
  health consequences. WHO Technical Advisory Group on Alcohol and Drug
  Epidemiology provides technical advice and input to WHO activities on
  monitoring alcohol consumption and treatment capacity for substance use
  disorders in its Member States. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Data compilation is to be performed centrally by WHO and UNODC based on
  data collected from countries that later will be validated through official
  focal points. </p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>During the reporting period 2013-2017, 62 countries have provided data on
  drug use disorders and 98 countries provided data on drug treatment. The
  availability and accuracy of data on the number of people with drug use
  disorders and people in treatment for the use of drugs is gradually
  increasing. </p>

  <p>For the number of alcohol use disorders data are currently available for
  188 Member States (for 2016) and validated through the process of country
  consultation. Data are regularly updated and presented through WHO Global
  Health Observatory. For utilization of treatment by people with alcohol use
  disorders, data are currently available for at least 30 countries and further
  data collection is ongoing </p>

  <p>For contextual information on treatment services, WHO has collected data
  from more than 85 countries; data collection for other is ongoing and to be
  accomplished till the end of 2019. </p>

  <p><strong>Time series: </strong></p>

  <p>During 2013-2017, 34 countries have provided at least two datapoints for
  both numerator and denominator necessary for the calculation of the SDG
  indicator on drug use disorders. With the improved ARQ, it is expected that
  the number of responses and quality of data reported will increase after 2021.
  For the alcohol, data on denominator are available for a long period since
  establishment of GISAH in 1997 and the indicator has been tentatively
  calculated for at least 30 countries in 2019, with contextual information
  available for 85. </p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>Given the policy importance, the indicator will be disaggregated to provide
  data for drugs and alcohol. Depending on data availability, it will be
  additionally disaggregated by following: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>by treatment interventions (pharmacological, psychosocial, rehabilitation and aftercare) </li>
    <li>by sex </li>
    <li>by age groups </li>
  </ul>

  <p>In relation to drug use disorders, the following types of drugs should be
  considered: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>cannabis (including herb and resin) </li>
    <li>opioids (opium, heroin, medicinal products containing opioids and other opioids)), </li>
    <li>cocaine type, </li>
    <li>amphetamines (amphetamine, methamphetamine, medicinal products containing ATS), </li>
    <li>ecstasy-type substances, </li>
    <li>sedatives and tranquilizers, </li>
    <li>hallucinogens </li>
    <li>solvents and inhalants </li>
    <li>NPS </li>
  </ul>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>Given the heterogeneity of national data collection systems, there is
  potential for discrepancies related either to the differences in recording the
  number of people in treatment and for people with substance use disorders. For
  this purpose, the ARQ has recently been improved to allow for countries to
  specify the nature of the data reported and to enable UNODC to assess the
  accuracy and comparability of data. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Apart from evaluating the consistency of data and addressing data
  discrepancies by using additional sources, UNODC is in continuous
  communication and discusses technical issues with reporting countries in order
  to minimize discrepancies and inconsistency of data. </p>
