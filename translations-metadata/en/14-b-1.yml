  computation of the sub-indicators under 4.c. and the Annex for the full
  original questions informing the sub-indicators. </p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>No applicable international standards for measuring degree of
  implementation of frameworks which recognize and protect access rights for
  small-scale fisheries.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Data are based on the replies to three questions of the CCRF questionnaire
  (see Annex). It is usually provided from administrative sources, as best
  identified by the national fisheries administration responsible for replying
  to the CCRF questionnaire. The data are based on the presence of relevant
  laws, regulations, policies, plans or strategies and how these have been
  implemented so both legislative, management, and other documentation must be
  consulted to respond to the queries.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The CCRF questionnaire is a web-based system, with related data processing
  tools and usability features. Data is collected from FAO member countries
  every two years to be reported at aggregated level on the occasion of the
  sessions of the FAO Committee on Fisheries (COFI), usually in the period
  November to March preceding the session of COFI. In 2016, for the 32nd Session
  of COFI, 92 countries and the European Union (EU) responded to the section on
  small-scale fisheries of the CCRF questionnaire, which includes the three
  questions providing the variables for indicator 14.b.1. </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>The questionnaire is sent out on a biennial basis. It is expected to be
  sent out towards the end of the year prior to the holding of the Committee on
  Fisheries and remain open for a 2-3 month period, alterations of this calendar
  are subject to changes in the timing of the Committee on Fisheries.</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>Data for the indicator are expected to be released one week after closure
  of the questionnaire.</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>Data are typically provided by the National Fishery
  Ministries/departments.</p>
COMPILING_ORG: <p>Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>Article I of the FAO constitution requires that the Organization collect,
  analyses, interpret and disseminate information relating to nutrition, food
  and agriculture http://www.fao.org/3/K8024E/K8024E.pdf.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Target 14.b focuses on access to resources and markets for small-scale
  fisheries, in line with the Rio+20 outcome document para, 175. In order to
  guarantee secure access, an enabling environment is necessary which recognizes
  and protects small-scale fisheries rights. Such an enabling environment has
  three key features:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Appropriate legal, regulatory and policy frameworks; </li>
    <li>Specific initiatives to support small-scale fisheries; and</li>
    <li>Related institutional mechanisms which allow for the participation of small-scale fisheries organisations in relevant processes. </li>
  </ol>

  <p>The 32nd Session of the FAO Committee on Fisheries agreed that the data
  submitted through the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF)
  questionnaire could be used by Members for reporting on Sustainable
  Development Goals (SDGs) indicators.</p>

  <p>The indicator variables are therefore chosen from three of the five
  questions on small-scale fisheries of the CCRF questionnaire to reflect these
  three aspects:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Are there any laws, regulations, policies, plans or strategies that specifically target or address the small-scale fisheries sector?</li>
    <li>Are there any ongoing specific initiatives to implement the SSF Guidelines?</li>
    <li>Does your country have an advisory/consultative body to the Ministry/Department of Fisheries in which fishers/fish workers can participate and contribute to decision-making processes?</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The national indicator is calculated based on these questions specifically
  focusing on actual efforts of promoting and facilitating access rights to
  small scale fisheries.</p>

  <p>Although the exact score will be important from one reporting year to the
  next for determining the progress made by a country, to aid the interpretation
  of this indicator, the score will then be converted into one of 5 bands as
  following:</p>

REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>It should be noted that while target 14.b refers to access for small-scale
  artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets some landlocked countries
  with inland fisheries have taken the opportunity to report on this
  indicator.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The indicator is calculated using three variables, which are given
  respective weightings for the final calculation. There has not been a change
  in the calculation, nor the use of mixed sources. </p>

  <p><strong>Variable 1</strong>: Existence of laws, regulations, policies,
  plans or strategies that specifically target or address the small-scale
  fisheries sector</p>

  <p><strong>Variable 2</strong>: Ongoing specific initiatives to implement the
  SSF Guidelines</p>

  <p><strong>Variable 3</strong>: Existence of mechanisms enabling small-scale
  fishers and fish workers to contribute to decision-making processes </p>

  <p>Performance is scored based on the country responses to the relevant
  portions of three questions included in the Code of Conduct for Responsible
  Fisheries Questionnaire (CCRF). These questions have been transformed into
  weighted variables for the purpose of calculating the country scores. <u>The
  target has been set at a positive (&#x2018;yes&#x2019;) response to all the
  sub-variables, resulting in a score of 1</u>. </p>

  <p>The higher weighting assigned to Variable 1 reflects the slightly greater
  importance of that indicator for assessing the degree of application of a
  legal/regulatory/policy/institutional framework which recognizes and protects
  access rights for small-scale fishers. </p>

  <p>Each sub-variable is scored on the basis of a &#x2018;yes&#x2019; or
  &#x2018;no&#x2019; response and any &#x2018;blank&#x2019; or
  &#x2018;unknown&#x2019; responses are scored as a &#x2018;no&#x2019;, or zero.
  A response of yes results in a score that corresponds with the full weighting
  value for that variable category. For example, a &#x2018;yes&#x2019; response
  for variables 1.3, 2.1 and 3.1 are scored as 0.1, 0.03 and 0.3 respectively.
  All &#x2018;no&#x2019;, &#x2018;blank&#x2019; or &#x2018;unknown&#x2019;
  responses are scored as zero.</p>

  <p>One exception is made in the case of sub-variable 1.5. This question allows
  a response of &#x2018;other&#x2019; with an associated text field. A positive
  response in this field is only scored as a &#x2018;yes&#x2019; in the case
  where the text field is also completed AND at least one of the other prior
  sub-variable were scored as &#x2018;no&#x2019;. This allows the indicator
  weighting to remain consistent in all cases.</p>

  <p>Once the specific score has been determined for each country, countries
  will be classified into a number of bands, ranging from a low to a high degree
  of implementation, and thus effectively translate a synthetic score into a
  tangible and intuitive metric for countries.</p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>Upon completing the questionnaire, States are provided with a condensed
  report showing their responses to relevant questions within the questionnaire
  for the indicator and the resulting SDG indicator score for their
  validation.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: <p>Not applicable</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p><strong>&#x2022;</strong> <strong>At country level</strong></p>

  <p>The most appropriate methodology for producing estimates for the indicator
  when the country data are not available would be the use of expert
  consultation and judgement rather than the use of mathematical formula for
  data imputation. The use of expert judgement is a critical factor as the
  indicator asses the state of management/ policy implementation at a national
  level, not values that could be readily inputted.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>&#x2022;</strong> <strong>At regional and global
  levels</strong></p>

  <p>Not applicable</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>The categorization into the respective bands will also apply in the case of
  regional and global aggregates for this indicator. Once the mean score for an
  SDG region has been calculated, the region will be classified into a
  particular band reflecting the degree of implementation of relevant
  instruments.</p>

  <p>Data is combined for the respective nations within a region, as a count of
  the number of countries by Band, and this can be further aggregated to the
  global level without the need for any weighting of national or regional
  scores.</p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>Data is collected through an electronic questionnaire submitted by FAO to
  the country focal points for the CCRF questionnaire, usually in the national
  fisheries administration. Data are validated upon intake of the
  questionnaires. No adjustments are required for the data for definitions nor
  for classification or demographic harmonization.</p>
QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>FAO is responsible for the quality of the internal statistical processes

  provides the necessary principles, guidelines and tools to carry out quality
  assessments. FAO is performing an internal bi-annual survey (FAO Quality
  Assessment and Planning Survey) designed to gather information on all of
  FAO&#x2019;s statistical activities, notably to assess the extent to which
  quality standards are being implemented with a view to increasing compliance
  with the quality dimensions of SQAF, documenting best practices and prepare
  quality improvement plans, where necessary. Domain-specific quality assurance
  activities are carried out systematically (e.g. quality reviews,
  self-assessments, compliance monitoring).</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>&#x2022; Data are checked for their correctness, completeness, consistency
  along the process of data entry, and/or through a specific statistical
  analysis as the yearly data set is closed. </p>

  <p>&#x2022; The indicator relies on data generated through the CCRF
  questionnaire which is filled in by countries on a biannual basis. To
  facilitate reporting of the CCRF-based SDG indicators, a tailor-made data
  processing tool has been developed within the framework of the existing CCRF
  questionnaire online platform. Upon submission of the questionnaire by the
  user, an indicator report will automatically be generated for final validation
  by the country.</p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>From 2022 data series onwards, questions of a factual nature used to
  indicate applicability of the indicator or to calculate the score of the
  indicator, such as whether a country is landlocked or whether it is a Party to
  a relevant international instrument will be pre-compiled. Official sources
  will be used to conduct this activity such as the depository of the relevant
  international binding instrument.</p>

  <p>This activity will be conducted for the following questions, please refer
  to Appendix 1 for full text of referenced question: A.1, 1.1, 2.1, 4.1 and
  5.1</p>

  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>In 2016, 92 countries and the European Union replied to the questionnaire
  section on the three indicators to measure target performance for 14.b.1. </p>

  <p>The below table indicates the scores for SDG 14.b.1 reporting that where
  validated by countries since 2018. </p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>2016 (baseline)</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>The disaggregation level is the national level. No demographic features are
  included in the indicators and are thus excluded from the consideration of
  level of disaggregation.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>There might be differences between a national estimated based on an expert
  judgment, in case of country data is not available, and the answer a country
  would give via the self-assessment questionnaire. This can happen not only
  because the expert judgement represents the best approximation to the reality,
  but not the reality itself, and/or due to the well-known self-report bias
  verifiable in this type of surveys that means countries will by tendency
  report a better reality that the one indeed in place.</p>
