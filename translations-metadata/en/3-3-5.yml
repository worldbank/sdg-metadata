  <p>NTDs are formally recognized as targets for global action in SDG target
  3.3, which calls to &#x201C;end the epidemics of ... neglected tropical
  diseases&#x201D; by 2030, as part of Goal 3 (Ensure healthy lives and ensure
  well-being for all at all ages). Successful interventions against NTDs
  contribute to meeting other SDGs, such as alleviating poverty (Goal 1) and
  hunger (Goal 2), enabling people to pursue an education (Goal 4) and lead
  productive working lives (Goal 8) and promoting equality, for example with
  regard to gender (Goals 5 and 10). Progress towards other Goals can accelerate
  the achievement of NTD goals. For example, wider provision of clean water,
  sanitation and hygiene (WASH) (Goal 6) is believed to help to eliminate or
  control NTDs; the availability of resilient infrastructure (Goal 9) should
  facilitate delivery of medicines and outreach to remote communities; the goals
  of sustainable cities (Goal 11) and climate action (Goal 13) can support the
  environmental management necessary for control of disease vectors. Attaining
  all SDGs and NTD goals is founded on strong global partnerships (Goal 17).</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Number of people requiring treatment and care for any one of the neglected
  tropical diseases (NTDs) targeted by the WHO NTD Roadmap and World Health
  Assembly resolutions and reported to WHO. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong> </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Treatment and care is broadly defined to allow for preventive, curative,
  surgical or rehabilitative treatment and care. In particular, it includes
  both: </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>1) Average annual number of people requiring mass treatment known as
  preventive chemotherapy (PC) for at least one PC-NTD; and </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>2) Number of new cases requiring individual treatment and care for other
  NTDs. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Other key interventions against NTDs (e.g. vector management, veterinary
  public health, water, sanitation and hygiene) are to be addressed in the
  context of other targets and indicators, namely Universal Health Coverage
  (UHC) and universal access to water and sanitation. </p>

  <p><strong>NTDs requiring preventive chemotherapy (PC-NTDs)</strong> </p>

  <p>As part of global efforts to accelerate expansion of preventive
  chemotherapy for elimination and control of lymphatic filariasis (LF),
  schistosomiasis (SCH) and soil-transmitted helminthiases (STH), WHO
  facilitates the supply of the following medicines donated by the
  pharmaceutical industry: diethylcarbamazine citrate, albendazole, mebendazole,
  and praziquantel. WHO also collaborates to supply ivermectin for
  onchocerciasis (ONCHO) and lymphatic filariasis elimination programmes. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>A joint mechanism and a set of forms have been developed to facilitate the
  process of application, review and reporting as well as to improve
  coordination and integration among different programmes. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Joint Request for Selected PC Medicines (JRSM) &#x2013; designed to assist
  countries in quantifying the number of tablets of the relevant medicines
  required to reach the planned target population and districts in a coordinated
  and integrated manner against multiple diseases during the year for which
  medicines are requested. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Joint Reporting Form (JRF) &#x2013; designed to assist countries in
  reporting annual progress on integrated and coordinated distribution of
  medicines across PC-NTDs in the reporting year in a standardized format. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>PC Epidemiological Data Reporting Form (EPIRF) &#x2013; designed to
  standardize national reporting of epidemiological data on lymphatic
  filariasis, onchocerciasis, soil-transmitted helminthiases and
  schistosomiasis. National authorities are encouraged to complete this form and
  submit it to WHO on a yearly basis, together with the JRF. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>The reports generated in the JRSM and in the JRF (SUMMARY worksheets) must
  be printed and signed by the NTD coordinator or a Ministry of Health
  representative to formally endorse the country&#x2019;s request for these
  medicines and the reported annual progress of the national programme(s). The
  date of signature must also be included. Once signatures have been obtained,
  the scanned copies of the two worksheets, together with the full Excel
  versions of the JRSM, the JRF and the EPIRF can be jointly submitted to WHO.
  </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>The forms are submitted to the WHO Representative of the concerned WHO
  Country office with electronic copies to <em><u>PC_JointForms@who.int</u></em>
  and the concerned Regional focal point, no later than 15 August of the year
  preceding the year for which medicines are intended to be used (e.g. at the
  latest by 15 August 2015 for implementation of preventive chemotherapy in
  2016) but at least 6-8 months before the planned PC intervention(s) to allow
  time for reviewing and approval of the request, placing order, manufacturing
  PC medicines and shipment to the country. </p>

  <p><strong>NTDs requiring individual diagnosis and treatment</strong> </p>

  <p>Countries are invited to report on Buruli ulcer, Chagas disease, leprosy,
  the leishmaniases, mycetoma, rabies and yaws cases using Excel templates or
  directly into the WHO integrated data platform (<a
  href="https://extranet.who.int/dhis2"
  target="_blank"><u>https://extranet.who.int/dhis2</u></a>). Modules are under
  development to collect information on snakebite envenoming, echinococcosis and
  taeniasis cases through this same platform. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Cases of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and other key HAT indicators
  are reported at village level by national sleeping sickness control programmes
  through annual reports and entered in the Atlas of HAT (<a
  href="https://www.who.int/trypanosomiasis_african/resources/j_healthgeographics_10.1186_1476_072X_9_57/en/"

COMPILING_ORG: <p>WHO </p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>A process of data reporting by national NTD programmes implemented
  according to the WHO Data Sharing Policy on use and sharing of data collected
  in Member States by the World Health Organization (WHO) outside the context of
  public health emergencies (<a
  href="https://www.who.int/about/who-we-are/publishing-policies/data-policy">https://www.who.int/about/who-we-are/publishing-policies/data-policy</a>).
  The department of control of Neglected tropical diseases at WHO is then
  responsible for processing and disseminating the statistics for this
  indicator.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p> </p>

  <p>The average annual number of people requiring treatment and care for NTDs
  is the number that is expected to decrease toward &#x201C;the end of
  NTDs&#x201D; by 2030 (target 3.3), as NTDs are eradicated, eliminated or
  controlled. The number of people requiring other interventions against NTDs
  (e.g. vector management, veterinary public health, water, sanitation and
  hygiene) are expected to need to be maintained beyond 2030 and are therefore
  to be addressed in the context of other targets and indicators, namely
  Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and universal access to water and sanitation.
  </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>This number should not be interpreted as the number of people at risk for
  NTDs. It is in fact a subset of the larger number of people at risk. Mass
  treatment is limited to those living in districts above a threshold level of
  prevalence; it does not include all people living in districts with any risk
  of infection. Individual treatment and care is for those who are or have
  already been infected; it does not include all contacts and others at risk of
  infection. This number can better be interpreted as the number of people at a
  level of risk requiring medical intervention &#x2013; that is, treatment and
  care for NTDs. </p>

  <p> </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Country reports may not be perfectly comparable over time. Improved
  surveillance and case-finding may lead to an apparent increase in the number
  of people known to require treatment and care. Some further estimation may be
  required to adjust for changes in surveillance and case-finding. Missing
  country reports may need to be imputed for some diseases in some years. </p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Some estimation is required to aggregate data across interventions and
  diseases. There is an established methodology that has been tested and an
  agreed international standard. [http://www.who.int/wer/2012/wer8702.pdf?ua=1]
  </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>1) Average annual number of people requiring mass treatment known as PC for
  at least one PC-NTD (lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis,
  soil-transmitted helminthiases and trachoma). People may require PC for more
  than one PC-NTD. The number of people requiring PC is compared across the
  PC-NTDs, by age group and implementation unit (e.g. district). The largest
  number of people requiring PC is retained for each age group in each
  implementation unit. The total is considered to be a conservative estimate of
  the number of people requiring PC for at least one PC-NTD. Prevalence surveys
  determine when an NTD has been eliminated or controlled and PC can be stopped
  or reduced in frequency, such that the average annual number of people
  requiring PC is reduced. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>2) Number of new cases requiring individual treatment and care for other
  NTDs: The number of new cases is based on country reports, whenever available,
  of new and known cases of Buruli ulcer, dengue, dracunculiasis,
  echinococcosis, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), leprosy, the
  leishmaniases, rabies and yaws. Where the number of people requiring and
  requesting surgery for PC-NTDs (e.g. trichiasis or hydrocele surgery) is
  reported, it can be added here. Similarly, new cases requiring and requesting
  rehabilitation (e.g. leprosy or lymphoedema) can be added whenever available.
  </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Populations referred to under 1) and 2) may overlap; the sum would
  overestimate the total number of people requiring treatment and care. The
  maximum of 1) or 2) is therefore retained at the lowest common implementation
  unit and summed to get conservative country, regional and global aggregates.
  By 2030, improved co-endemicity data and models will validate the trends
  obtained using this simplified approach. </p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>Data is jointly validated by the three levels of the organization &#x2013;
  countries, regions and global.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: <p>Not applicable</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <ul>
    <li>At country level </li>
  </ul>

  <p> </p>

  <p>We do not impute missing values for countries that have never reported data
  for any NTD. For countries that have reported data in the past, we impute
  missing values only for those NTDs that have been reported in the past but
  that have not been reported in the current year. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>For reproducibility, we employ multiple imputation techniques using the
  freely available Amelia package in R. We impute 100 complete datasets using
  all available cross-sectional data (countries and years), applying a square
  root transformation to exclude negative values of incidence, as well as
  categorical variables denoting regions and income groups, and allowing for
  country-specific linear time effects. We aggregate across diseases and extract
  the mean and 2.5th and 97.5th centile values to report best estimates and
  uncertainty intervals for each country. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <ul>
    <li>At regional and global levels </li>
  </ul>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Using the 100 imputed datasets, we aggregate across diseases and regions,
  extract the mean and 2.5th and 97.5th centile values to report best estimates
  and uncertainty intervals at the regional and global levels. </p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Global and regional estimates are simple aggregates of the country values,
  with no particular weighting. There is no further adjustment for global and
  regional estimates. </p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>This indicator is based on national-level data reported to WHO by its
  Member States and disseminated via the WHO Global Health Observatory (<u>
  https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/neglected-tropical-diseases</u>) and
  <u>PC</u> Data Portal (http://apps.who.int/gho/cabinet/pc.jsp). Some
  adjustment is required to aggregate country-reported data on individual
  neglected tropical diseases across all NTDs included in this indicator. There
  is an established methodology to standardize this aggregation: <a
  href="http://www.who.int/wer/2012/wer8702.pdf?ua=1"><u>http://www.who.int/wer/2012/wer8702.pdf</u></a></p>

  <p>Following a recommendation by the Working Group on Monitoring and
  Evaluation of the Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for NTDs, WHO has led
  the development of an integrated NTD database to improve evidence-based
  planning and management of NTD programmes at the national and sub-national
  levels. The Integrated NTD database is available here: <u>
  https://www.who.int/teams/control-of-neglected-tropical-diseases/preventive-chemotherapy/integrated-ntd-database</u>.
  </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>For NTDs requiring preventive chemotherapy, a joint reporting mechanism and
  set of reporting forms have been developed to facilitate the process of
  requesting donated medicines and reporting progress as well as to improve
  coordination and integration among programmes, more information is available
  here, <u>
  https://www.who.int/teams/control-of-neglected-tropical-diseases/preventive-chemotherapy/joint-application-package
  </u> </p>

  <p><strong> </strong></p>

  <p>For the other NTDs, the number of new cases should be reported by the
  health facilities to the national level in order to compile them. If active
  case search activities are organized (e.g. for integrated skin NTDs, human
  African trypanosomiasis, etc.), the country must ensure that the number of new
  cases detected through these activities are also reported, either through the
  health facilities or directly to the national level. A strong health
  information system is essential for countries to be able to collect, compile
  and analyse good quality information on these NTDs.</p>
QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>A framework for monitoring and evaluating progress of the road map for
  neglected tropical diseases guides activities involving the development of
  standards, tools and methods for generating, collecting, compiling, analysing,
  using and disseminating high-quality data on NTDs. At WHO, the department of
  control of neglected tropical diseases is responsible for curating and
  generating the statistics on NTDs, which will be checked and validated
  internally by the Division of Data and Analytics before publication and
  dissemination.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>Training materials for the Integrated NTD database are available here: <u>
  https://www.who.int/teams/control-of-neglected-tropical-diseases/preventive-chemotherapy/integrated-ntd-database</u>.
  A user guide and video tutorial for the joint reporting mechanism and set of
  reporting forms are available here: <u>
  https://www.who.int/teams/control-of-neglected-tropical-diseases/preventive-chemotherapy/joint-application-package
  </u> </p>

  <p>Details about individual NTD data are available via: <u>
  https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/neglected-tropical-diseases</u>. For
  NTDs requiring preventive chemotherapy, reports are signed by the NTD
  coordinator or a Ministry of Health representative to formally endorse the
  country&#x2019;s request for medicines (when applicable) and data. They are
  submitted to the WHO Representative of the concerned WHO Country office. </p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>A data quality review toolkit has been developed by WHO to provide a
  multi-pronged approach that ensures a comprehensive and holistic review of the
  quality of health facility data. WHO has also developed a field manual to
  guide national NTD programmes in using tools to improve data quality and
  information, through coverage evaluation surveys, data quality assessments and
  a supervisors&#x2019; coverage tool (<a
  href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329376/9789241516464-eng.pdf">https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329376/9789241516464-eng.pdf</a>).</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p>Data availability: </p>

  <p>Data are currently being reported by 191 countries, with good coverage of
  all regions. </p>

  <p>Time series:</p>

  <p>2010-2019</p>

  <p>Disaggregation: </p>

  <p>Disaggregation by disease is required; ending the epidemic of NTDs requires
  a reduction in the number of people requiring interventions for each NTD.</p>

  <p>Disaggregation by age is required for PC: preschool-aged children (1-4
  years), school-aged (5-14 years) and adults (= 15 years). </p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>Sources of discrepancies:</p>

  <p>Countries do not typically aggregate their data across NTDs, but if they
  applied the aggregation method as described above, they would obtain the same
  number. The only exceptions would be countries with one or more missing values
  for individual NTDs. In these exceptional cases, internationally estimated
  aggregates will be higher than country produced aggregates that assume missing
  values are nil. We present best estimates with uncertainty intervals to
  highlight those missing values that have a significant impact on country
  aggregates, until such time that missing values are reported. </p>
