  <p>This implies the need to measure both the extent of land under productive
  and sustainable agriculture (the numerator), as well as the extent of
  agriculture land area (the denominator).</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The <em>numerator</em> captures the three dimensions of sustainable production: environmental, economic and social. It corresponds to agricultural land area of the farms that satisfy the sustainability criteria of the 11 sub-indicators selected across all three dimensions.</li>
    <li>The <em>denominator</em> in turn the sum of agricultural land area (as defined by FAO) utilized by agricultural holdings that are owned (excluding rented-out), rented-in, leased, sharecropped or borrowed. State or communal land used by farm holdings is not included. Please see the <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/ca7154en/ca7154en.pdf">methodological document</a> prepared by FAO for a more detailed explanation.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The scope of indicator 2.4.1 is the agricultural farm holding, and more
  precisely the agricultural land area of the farm holding, i.e. land used
  primarily to grow crops and raise livestock. This choice of scope is fully
  consistent with the intended use of a country&#x2019;s agricultural land area
  as the denominator of the aggregate indicator. Specifically the following
  are:</p>

  <p>Included within scope:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Intensive and extensive crops and livestock production systems.</li>
    <li>Subsistence agriculture.</li>
    <li>State and common land when used exclusively and managed by the farm holding.</li>
    <li>Food and non-food crops and livestock products (e.g. tobacco, cotton, and sheep wool). </li>
    <li>Crops grown for fodder or for energy purposes.</li>
    <li>Agro-forestry (trees on the agriculture areas of the farm).</li>
    <li>Aquaculture, to the extent that it takes place within the agricultural land area. For example, rice-fish farming and similar systems. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Excluded from scope:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>State and common land not used exclusively by the farm holding.</li>
    <li>Nomadic pastoralism.</li>
    <li>Production from gardens and backyards. Production from hobby farms<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[1]</a></sup>.</li>
    <li>Holdings focusing exclusively on aquaculture. </li>
    <li>Holdings focusing exclusively on forestry.</li>
    <li>Food harvested from the wild.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Concepts:</h2>

  <p>The literature review (Hayati, 2017) identified a large number of potential
  sustainability themes across the three dimensions of sustainability and, for
  each theme, usually a large number of possible sub-indicators. The key
  considerations in the selection of themes are relevance and measurability. In
  terms of relevance, the relationship between the associated sub-indicator and
  sustainable agriculture outcomes at farm level should be strong. Following
  this approach, only sub-indicators that are responsive to farm level policies
  aimed at improving sustainable agriculture are considered. In terms of
  measurability, only a &#x201C;core&#x201D; set of themes and sub-indicators
  for which measurement and reporting is expected in the majority of countries
  are selected.</p>

  <p>A key aspect of all approaches to measuring sustainable agriculture is the
  recognition that sustainability is a multi-dimensional concept, and that these
  multiple dimensions need to be reflected in the construction of the indicator.
  This implies that SDG indicator 2.4.1 must be based on a set of sub-indicators
  that cover these three dimensions.</p>

  <p>Through a consultative process that has lasted over two years, 11 themes
  and sub-indicators have been identified, which make up SDG 2.4.1.</p>

SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Different data are collected through different instruments. Often,
  environmental data are collected through environmental monitoring systems,
  including remote sensing. Yet many countries do not have the capacity or
  resources to do so, and therefore these data are sparse or non-existent. In
  order to propose a manageable and cost-effective solution, a requirement
  stressed by several countries during the consultations, the methodology offers
  a single data collection instrument for all sub-indicators: the farm
  survey.<br></p>

  <p>Several countries have suggested using existing data sources or alternative
  data sources on the grounds that these instruments can be more cost-effective
  and sometimes provide more reliable results than farm surveys. These
  instruments include remote sensing, GIS, models, agricultural surveys,
  household surveys, administrative data or environmental monitoring systems.
  The methodology considers the possibility to use such instruments, subject to
  a series of criteria to ensure data quality and international comparability.
  Other data sources may also be used to complement and/or validate farm survey
  results.</p>

  <p>The methodology note also recommends that countries complement the farm
  survey with a monitoring systems that can measure the impact of agriculture on
  the environment (soil, water, fertilizer and pesticide pollution,
  biodiversity, etc.) and on health (pesticides residues in food and human
  bodies). This will provide additional information and help crosscheck the
  robustness of SDG indicator 2.4.1 with regard to the environmental dimension
  of sustainability.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>A questionnaire is sent to all countries annually since 2020 (<a
  href="http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators/241/en/">http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators/241/en/</a>
  ). Furthermore in order to facilitate data collection by countries, a data
  module has been designed, which contains the core set of questions necessary
  to obtain the data for SDG 2.4.1. If farm surveys already exist within a
  country, these questions can be integrated into existing instruments in order
  to minimize the burden to national statistical offices in data collection.</p>

  <p>All data collection activities will be done through the National
  Statistical Office or the office designated to collect data for this
  indicator. FAO, together with the Global Strategy to improve Agriculture and
  Rural Statistics (GSARS), have developed the capacity development material
  necessary for this indicator, including a methodological guide, an enumerator
  manual, calculation document and an e-learning course to train country NSO and
  other relevant staff on the indictor. </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>Data collection will depend on currently existing data collection cycles
  for farm surveys within countries. FAO has integrated the questionnaire module
  associated with this indicator in in AGRISurvey Programme and 50x2030

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The approaches to framing and defining sustainable agriculture vary in
  terms of their coverage of the three primary dimensions of sustainability,
  i.e. economic, environmental and social, and in terms of the scale that is
  used to assess sustainability, i.e. from field and farm scales, to national
  and global scales. Some approaches consider different features of
  sustainability, for example whether current practices are economically
  feasible, environmentally friendly and socially desirable. Other approaches
  focus on particular practices such as organic, regenerative or low-input
  agriculture and can equate these with sustainable agriculture. </p>

  <p>The conclusion from a literature review associated with the methodological
  development of this indicator is that the multi-dimensional approach developed
  by FAO in 1988 is a meaningful framing of the concept. Thus, sustainable
  agriculture can be considered as &#x201C;the management and conservation of
  the natural resource base, and the orientation of technological and
  institutional change in such a manner as to ensure the attainment and
  continued satisfaction of human needs for present and future generation. Such
  development (in agriculture, forestry and fishing etc.) conserves land, water,
  plant and animal genetic resources, environmentally non-degrading, technically
  appropriate, economically viable and socially acceptable.&#x201D; (FAO,
  1988)</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>During the consultations undertaken, several countries highlighted the
  difficulties in combining data from different sources and requested that this
  be avoided to the extent possible. Other, relatively data rich, countries,
  instead, insisted on the need to allow for the use of existing data sources.
  The updated methodology addresses both concerns: it offers the farm survey as
  a single data collection instrument for all sub-indicators, but it also offers
  the possibility of using a combination of different data sources as an
  alternative option as long as certain criteria are satisfied.</p>

  <p>The decision to use the farm survey as a data collection instrument for
  this indicator is in line with countries&#x2019; efforts, supported by FAO, to
  develop farm surveys as the most appropriate tool for generating agricultural
  statistics. It also benefits from the FAO work in developing the Agricultural
  Integrated Survey (AGRIS) programme, which is implemented as part of a new
  initiative called <a href="http://www.data4sdgs.org/50by2030">50 X 2030</a>.
  </p>

  <p>The decision to focus on farm survey has implications on the type of
  information that it is possible to capture in order to cover the different
  dimensions of sustainability. While farm surveys are well suited to measure
  the economic dimension of sustainability, they may not be the ideal tool for
  measuring environmental and social sustainability in terms of impact/outcomes.
  </p>

  <p>Typically, environmental impacts of agriculture are measured through
  monitoring systems like remote sensing, soil and water sampling, or other
  tools associated with a specific area, rather than with a single agricultural
  holding. For several environmental themes, it is unlikely that farmers would
  be able to assess the environmental impact of their farming practices on
  issues like fertilizer pollution or pesticide impact. Using a farm survey
  instrument, instead of environmental monitoring systems, therefore implies
  moving from measuring outcome/impact to assessing farmers&#x2019; practices.
  Whenever possible, however, the revised methodology continues to focus on
  measuring outcomes. </p>

  <p>Similarly, the sub-themes under the social dimension are usually best
  captured through household surveys. While in the majority of cases
  agricultural holdings are closely associated with a given household, this is
  not always the case, and therefore capturing the social dimension of
  sustainability through a farm survey, especially if it is not designed to
  cover social aspects could pose certain challenges.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Steps to calculate SDG 2.4.1 include:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Determining the <strong>scope </strong>of the indicator: The scope of Indicator 2.4.1 is the agricultural farm holding, and more precisely the agricultural land area of the farm holding, i.e., land used primarily to grow crops and raise livestock. Forestry, fisheries and aquaculture activities may be included to the extent that they are secondary activities conducted on the agricultural area of the farm holding, for example rice-fish farming and similar systems.</li>
    <li>Determining the <strong>dimensions </strong>to be covered: Indicator 2.4.1 includes environmental, economic and social dimensions in the sustainability assessment. </li>
    <li>Choosing the <strong>scale </strong>for the sustainability assessment: Indicator 2.4.1 is farm level with aggregation to higher levels.</li>
    <li>Selecting the data collection <strong>instrument(s). </strong>It is recommended that indicator 2.4.1 be collected through a farm survey<strong>.</strong></li>
    <li>Selecting the <strong>themes </strong>within each dimension, and choosing a <strong>sub-indicator</strong> for each theme. The sub-indicators should satisfy a number of criteria (described in annex 1 for each sub-indicator, respectively). </li>
    <li>Assessing <strong>sustainability performance at farm level for each sub-indicator</strong>: Specific sustainability <strong>criteria</strong> are applied in order to assess the sustainability level of the farm for each theme according to the respective sub-indicators. </li>
    <li>Deciding the <strong>periodicity of monitoring the indicator</strong>. It is recommended to be collected at least every three years.</li>
    <li><strong>Modality of reporting the indicator. </strong>The set of sub-indicators are presented in the form of a <strong>dashboard</strong>. The dashboard approach offers a response in terms of measuring sustainability at farm level and aggregating it at national level. </li>
  </ol>

  <p>The 2.4.1 methodology proposes reporting of indicator 2.4.1 through a
  national-level dashboard, presenting the different sub-indicators together but
  independently. The dashboard approach offers several advantages, including the
  possibility of combining data from different sources and identification of
  critical sustainability issues, facilitating the search for a balance between
  the three sustainability dimensions. As a result, countries can easily
  visualize their performance in terms of the different sustainability
  dimensions and themes, and understand where policy efforts can be focused for
  future improvements.</p>

  <p>Computation of results and construction of the dashboard are performed for
  each sub-indicator separately using the &#x2018;traffic light&#x2019; approach
  already defined for each sub-indicator: aggregation at national level is
  performed for each sub-indicator independently, by summing the agricultural
  land area of each agricultural holdings by sustainability category (red,
  yellow or green), and reporting the resulting national total as percentage of
  the total national agricultural land area of all agricultural farm holdings in
  the country. In practice, the reported value of Indicator 2.4.1 is determined
  by the results of most-limiting sub-indicator in terms of sustainability
  performance</p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>The data undergo comprehensive validation work that cover: detection of
  outliers, transmission errors and data consistency checks. Countries asked to
  examine the disseminated results for their country and either to confirm that
  they are correct or to provide remarks and / or revise data if they identify
  errors. </p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>Adjustments to total national agricultural area may be made to correct for
  common areas that are out of scope with regards to the indicator
  methodology.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p>Partial non-response at individual level (farm holding) will be imputed
  using appropriate statistical techniques, such as nearest-neighbour
  algorithms. The decision on whether to impute or not and the choice of the
  method is a function of the nature of the variable to impute and the amount
  and type of data available for the imputation, such as the availability of
  auxiliary data coming from different sources (e.g. surveys, administrative
  information). </p>

  <p>It is important to clearly distinguish missing data from non-applicable
  events. As specified above and in the sub-indicator methodology sheets, some
  sub-indicators can be recorded as &#x2018;not applicable&#x2019; for a given
  farm. In this case, the farm will be considered sustainable from the

  <p>Data availability:</p>

  <p>Many sub-indicators for this indicator are already being collected in

  adherence to international comparability. </p>

  <h2>Time series:</h2>

  <p>SDG Indicator 2.4.1 measures progress towards more sustainable and
  productive agriculture over a three year periodicity because for many
  sub-indicators, it is likely that changes will be relatively limited from a
  year to another. Furthermore, the 3-year periodicity will enable countries to
  have three data points on the indicator before 2030.</p>

  <p>Disaggregation:</p>

  <p>Indicator 2.4.1 is expected to be collected through farm surveys and the
  result expressed as a national value. However, the methodology is scale
  independent and can be adopted at any geographical level. In addition the
  indicator can be disaggregated according to type of farming system (crop,
  livestock or mixed) and other characteristics of the farm e.g.
  household/non-household sector, irrigated/non-irrigated or gender of the farm
  holder.</p>

  <p>Annex: description of the sub-indicators</p>

  <h3>1. Farm output value per hectare</h3>

  <p><strong>Dimension: </strong>Economic<strong> </strong></p>

  <p><strong>Theme: </strong>Land Productivity </p>

  <p>Land productivity is a measure of agricultural value of outputs obtained on
  a given area of land. Maintaining or improving the output over time relative
  to the area of land used is an important aspect in sustainability for a range
  of reasons. At farm level, the land productivity reflects technology and
  production processes for given agro-ecological conditions. In a broader sense,
  an increase in the level of land productivity enables higher production while
  reducing pressure on increasingly scarce land resources, commonly linked to
  deforestation and associated losses of ecosystem services and
  biodiversity.<strong> </strong></p>

  <p><strong>Coverage</strong>: All farm types </p>

  <p><strong>Description: </strong></p>

  <p>The sub-indicator is described as farm output value per hectare (holdings
  that produce crops and livestock or its mix). Information on farm outputs and
  agricultural area should be standard information available from farm surveys
  thus providing a good basis for assessment at farm level.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Farm output value: The volume of agricultural output at farm level generally takes into account production of multiple outputs, e.g. crop types and crop and livestock combinations, etc. Since the volume of agricultural outputs is not measured in commensurate units (e.g. not all outputs are measured in tonnes, and tonnes of different output represent different products), it is necessary to establish an appropriate means of aggregation, in this case using a monetary unit. A simple way to enable aggregation is to reflect the multiple outputs produced by a single farm in terms of values (i.e. quantity multiplied by prices).</li>
    <li>Farm agricultural land area: defined as the area of land used for agriculture within the farm<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4">[2]</a></sup>. </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Sustainability criteria: </strong></p>

  <p>Distance from the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile of the national
  distribution<sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5">[3]</a></sup>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Green (desirable): Sub-indicator value is &#x2265; 2/3 of the corresponding 90<sup>th</sup> percentile </li>
    <li>Yellow (acceptable): Sub-indicator value is &#x2265; 1/3 and &lt; 2/3 of the corresponding 90<sup>th</sup> percentile </li>
    <li>Red (unsustainable): Sub-indicator value is &lt; 1/3 of the corresponding 90<sup>th</sup> percentile</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Data items</strong></p>

  <p>Reference period: last calendar year</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <ol>
        <li>Quantities and farm gate prices (or value of production) of the 5 main crops and/or livestock products and by-products produced by the farm</li>
        <li>Quantities and farm gate prices (or value of production) of other agricultural products (agro-forestry or aquaculture products etc.) produced by the farm </li>
        <li>Agricultural land area of the holding</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Net Farm Income</h3>

  <p><strong>Dimension:</strong> Economic<strong> </strong></p>

  <p><strong>Theme:</strong> Profitability</p>

  <p>An important part of sustainability in agriculture is the economic
  viability of the farm, driven to a large extent by its profitability.
  Profitability is measured using the net income that the farmer is able to gain
  from farming operations. Availability and use of information on farm economic
  performance, measured using profitability, will support better decision making
  both at micro and macro-economic level. Since performance measures drive
  behaviour, better information on performance can alter behaviour and
  decision-making by government and producers both in large-scale commercial
  farming and medium and small-scale subsistence agriculture.</p>

  <p><strong>Coverage:</strong> All farms types </p>

  <p><strong>Description: </strong></p>

  <p>The sub-indicator measures if the farm is consistently profitable over a
  3-year period. The focus of this sub-indicator is on income from farming
  operations as distinct from the total income of the farming household, which
  may include other sources of income such as, for example, employment in local
  businesses by other family members, tourism activity, etc.</p>

  <p>where:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>NFI = Total Net Farm Income</li>
    <li>CR = Total farm cash receipts including direct program payments</li>
    <li>Y<sub>k</sub> = Income in kind</li>
    <li>OE = Total operating expenses after rebates (including costs of labour)</li>
    <li>Dep = Depreciation</li>
    <li>VIC = Value of inventory change</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Definitions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Net farm income refers to the return (both monetary and non-monetary) to farm operators for their labor, management and capital, after all production expenses have been paid (that is, gross farm income minus production expenses). It includes net income from farm production, the value of commodities consumed on the farm, depreciation, and inventory changes.</li>
    <li>Gross farm income refers to the monetary and non-monetary income received by farm. Its main components include cash receipts from the sale of farm products, direct program payments to producers, other farm income (such as income from custom work), value of food and fuel produced and consumed on the same farm, and change in value of year-end inventories of crops and livestock<sup><a href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7">[5]</a></sup>.</li>
    <li>Farm cash receipts include revenues from the sale of agricultural commodities in local currency units that include sales of crops, livestock and its by-products.</li>
    <li>Direct program payments to producers included in farm cash receipts represent the amounts paid under various government and private programs to individuals involved in agricultural production. The payments related to current agricultural production include subsidies to encourage production or to compensate producers for low market returns, payments to stabilize incomes and payments to compensate producers for crop or livestock losses caused by extreme climatic conditions, disease or other reasons and insurance payments.</li>
    <li>Income-in-kind measures the value of the agricultural goods produced on farms and consumed by farm operator families. It is included to measure total farm production. </li>
    <li>Operating expenses represent business costs incurred by farm businesses for goods and services used in the production process. Expenses include both purchase and self-produced items that are: property taxes, custom work, seeds, rent, fertiliser and lime, chemicals, machinery and building repairs, irrigation, fuel for heating and machines, wages, interest and business share of insurance premiums. </li>
    <li>Depreciation charges account for the economic depreciation or for the loss in fair market value of the capital assets of the farm business. Calculated on farm buildings, farm machinery, and the farm business share of autos, trucks and the farm home, depreciation is generally considered to be the result of aging, wear and tear, and obsolescence. It represents a decrease in the potential economic benefits that can be generated by the capital asset. </li>
    <li>Value of inventory change (VIC) measures the currency value of the physical change in producer-owned inventories. This concept is used to value total agricultural economic production. To calculate VIC, the change in producer-owned inventories (between the end and the beginning of a calendar year) is first derived and then multiplied by the average annual crop prices or value per animal. This calculation is different from the financial or accounting book value approach, which values the beginning and ending stocks, and then derives the change.</li>
    <li>The VIC over all the major commodities can vary widely (depending on the size of the change of inventories and prices). The VIC can be either positive (when inventories are larger at the end of the year compared to the beginning levels) or negative (when year- end inventories are smaller than the levels at the beginning of the year). If the inventory levels are the same at the beginning and end of the year, VIC will be zero despite price changes.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Estimating profitability at a farm level will generally require compilation
  of basic farm financial records, i.e. daily, weekly, monthly or seasonal
  transactions in an organized way. In general, large commercial farms maintain
  detailed financial records however, in case of medium farms and small
  subsistence agriculture, record keeping is seldom practiced and in most of the
  countries it doesn&#x2019;t exist at all. </p>

  <p>In case when detailed data are not available at farm level, then estimates
  will be calculated based on farmer declaration of both outputs and inputs
  quantities and prices. In these cases, depreciation, variation of stocks and
  taxes may be neglected. This is described below as simplified option (1).</p>

  <p>A simplified option (2) is also offered, based on farmer&#x2019;s
  declaration of the agricultural holding&#x2019;s profitability over the last
  three calendar years. It is recommended to use this simplified option only
  when other two options are not feasible.</p>

  <p><strong>Sustainability criteria: </strong></p>

  <p>For a farm to be profitable the net farm income should be above zero. </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Green (desirable): above zero for past 3 consecutive years</li>
    <li>Yellow (acceptable): above zero for at least 1 of the past 3 consecutive years</li>
    <li>Red (unsustainable): below zero for all of the past 3 consecutive years</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Data items</strong></p>

  <p>Reference period: last three calendar years</p>

  <p><strong><em>Recommended option</em></strong></p>

  <p>Data from farm financial records, i.e. daily, weekly, monthly or seasonal
  transactions are collected in an organized way (in general, large commercial
  farms maintain detailed financial records on the basis of which the NFI can be
  calculated as per above equation). </p>

  <p><strong><em>Simplified option (1)</em></strong></p>

  <p>To be used when the detailed data are not available at farm level (better
  adapted to smallholders and household sector). </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <ol>
        <li>Quantity produced (i.e. crops and livestock and its products and by-products produced both for market or self-consumption) </li>
        <li>Farm gate prices of the above quantities produces</li>
        <li>Operating expenses including inputs quantities and its market prices</li>
        <li>Quantity/output of other on-farm activities carried out and/or commodities produced on the holding e.g. aquaculture, agroforestry and others</li>
        <li>Farm gate prices of the other on-farm activities/commodities</li>
        <li>Input quantities and prices that are used to produce other on-farm outputs</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong><em>Simplified option (2)</em></strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <ol>
        <li>Respondent&#x2019;s declaration on agricultural holding&#x2019;s profitability over the last 3 calendar years</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

  <p><strong>Dimension: </strong>Economic<strong> </strong></p>

  <p><strong>Theme: </strong>Resilience</p>

  <p>Resilience encompass absorptive, anticipatory and adaptive capacities and
  refers to the properties of a system that allows farms to deal with shocks and
  stresses, to persist and to continue to be well-functioning (in the sense of
  providing stability, predictable rules, security and other benefits to its
  members). </p>

  <p><strong>Coverage: </strong>All farms types<strong> </strong></p>

  <p><strong>Description: </strong></p>

  <p>This sub-indicator measures the incidence of the following mitigation
  mechanisms: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Access to or availed credit<sup><a href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8">[6]</a></sup></li>
    <li>Access to or availed insurance</li>
    <li>On farm diversification (share of a single agricultural commodity not greater than 66% in the total value of production of the holding)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Access to credit and/or insurance is defined here as when a given service
  is available and the holder has enough means to obtain the service (required
  documents, collateral, positive credit history, etc.). Broadly, access to one
  or more the above 3 factors will allow the farm to prevent, resist, adapt and
  recover from external shocks such as, floods, droughts, market failure (e.g.
  price shock), climate shock and pest/animal diseases. </p>

  <p><strong>Sustainability criteria: </strong></p>

  <p>A farm holding is considered resilient if it has availed or has the means
  to access the risk mitigation mechanisms as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Green (desirable): Access to or availed at least two of the above-listed mitigation mechanisms.</li>
    <li>Yellow (acceptable): Access to or availed at least one of the above-listed mitigation mechanisms.</li>
    <li>Red (unsustainable): No access to the listed mitigation mechanisms. </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Prevalence of soil degradation</h3>

  <p><strong>Dimension: </strong>Environmental<strong> </strong></p>

  <p><strong>Theme: </strong>Soil health </p>

  <p>Many of the processes affecting soil health are driven by agricultural
  practices. FAO and the Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils (ITPS) have
  identified 10 main threats to soil functions: soil erosion; soil organic
  carbon losses; nutrient imbalance; acidification; contamination; waterlogging;
  compaction; soil sealing; salinization and loss of soil biodiversity. </p>

  <p><strong>Coverage: </strong>All farms types<strong> </strong></p>

  <p><strong>Description: </strong></p>

  <p>The sub-indicator measures the extent to which agriculture activities
  affects soil health and therefore represents a sustainability issue. A review
  of the 10 threats to soil shows that all except one (soil sealing, which is
  the loss of natural soil to construction/urbanisation) are potentially and
  primarily affected by inappropriate agricultural practices. Ideally,
  therefore, all soils under agricultural land area in a country should be the
  subject of periodic monitoring in order to assess the impact of agriculture on
  soils. This requires detailed surveys and sampling campaigns, associated with
  laboratory testing. In order to propose a manageable solution while capturing
  the main trends in the country in terms of soil health, the farm survey
  focuses on the four threats that combine the characteristics more widespread
  (for national monitoring, countries may choose to add any of the other areas
  indicated above, depending on relevance), and easier to assess through farm
  surveys:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Soil erosion</li>
    <li>Reduction in soil fertility</li>
    <li>Salinization of irrigated land</li>
    <li>Waterlogging</li>
    <li>Other - Specify</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The farm survey captures farmer&#x2019;s knowledge about the situation of
  the agricultural holding in terms of soil degradation. Experience has shown
  that farmers are very much aware of the state of their soils, health and
  degradation level. Farmers may also be offered the opportunity to mention
  other threats than the above four. </p>

  <p>Other data sources on soil health may either complement the information
  collected through the farm survey and offer opportunities for cross-checking
  farmers&#x2019; responses; or be used as alternative sources of data. Prior to
  the farm survey, a desk study could collect all available information on soil
  health, including using national official statistics or statistics available
  from international agencies such as FAO. This typically includes maps, models,
  results from soil sampling, laboratory analysis and field surveys, and all
  existing report on soil and land degradation at national level. On the basis
  of this information, maps or tables (by administrative boundaries or other
  divisions of the country) can be established, showing the threats to soils
  according to the above 4 categories of threats.</p>

  <p><strong>Sustainability criteria: </strong></p>

  <p>Proportion of agricultural area of the farm affected by soil
  degradation.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Green (desirable): The combined area affected by any of the four selected threats to soil health is negligible (less than 10% of the total agriculture area of the farm).</li>
    <li>Yellow (acceptable): The combined area affected by any of the four selected threats to soil health is between 10% and 50% of the total agriculture area of the farm.</li>
    <li>Red (unsustainable): The combined area affected by any of the four selected threats to soil health is above 50% of the total agriculture area of the farm.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5. Variation in water availability</h3>

  <p>Dimension: Environmental </p>

  <p>Theme: Water use</p>

  <p>Agriculture, more specifically irrigated agriculture, is by far the main
  economic sector using freshwater resources. In many places, water withdrawal
  from rivers and groundwater aquifers is beyond what can be considered
  environmentally sustainable. This affects both rivers and underground
  aquifers. Sustainable agriculture therefore requires that that level of use of
  freshwater for irrigation remains within acceptable boundaries. While there is
  no internationally agreed standards of water use sustainability, signals
  associated with unsustainable use of water typically include progressive
  reduction in the level of groundwater, drying out of springs and rivers,
  increased conflicts among water users. </p>

  <p><strong>Coverage: </strong>All farm types<strong> </strong></p>

  <p><strong>Description: </strong></p>

  <p>The sub-indicator captures the extent to which agriculture contributes to
  unsustainable patterns of water use. Ideally, the level of sustainability in
  water use is measured at the scale of the river basin or groundwater aquifer,
  as it is the combined effect of all users sharing the same resource that
  impact water sustainability. The farm survey captures farmers&#x2019;
  awareness and behaviour in relation with water scarcity, and associates them
  with three levels of sustainability. These awareness and behaviour are
  expressed in terms of:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>whether the farmer uses water to irrigate crops on at least 10% of the agriculture area of the farm and why, if the answer is negative (does not need, cannot afford);</li>
    <li>whether the farmer is aware about issues of water availability in the area of the farm and notices a reduction in water availability over time;</li>
    <li>whether there are organizations (water users organisations, others) in charge of allocating water among users and the extent to which these organisations are working effectively.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Other data sources may either complement the farm survey on water use and
  offer opportunities for cross-checking farmers&#x2019; responses; or be used
  as alternative sources of data. Prior to the farm survey, a desk study should
  collect all available information on water balance, including national
  official statistics or statistics available from international agencies such
  as FAO. Information on water resources and use is usually collected by the
  entities in charge of water management or monitoring and are organised by
  hydrological entity (river basin or groundwater aquifer). They typically
  include hydrological records (river flow, groundwater levels), models and maps
  showing the extent of water use by hydrological entity.</p>

  <p><strong>Sustainability criteria: </strong></p>

  <p>Farm sustainability in relation with water use will be assessed as follows:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Green (desirable): Water availability remains stable over the years, for farms irrigating crops on more than 10% of the agriculture area of the farm. Default result for farms irrigating less than 10% of their agricultural area </li>
    <li>Yellow (acceptable): uses water to irrigate crops on at least 10% of the agriculture area of the farm, does not know whether water availability remains stable over the years, or experiences reduction on water availability over the years, but there is an organisation that effectively allocates water among users. </li>
    <li>Red (unsustainable): in all other cases. </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Data items</strong></p>

  <p>Reference period: last three calendar years</p>

  <p>5.1 Irrigated agricultural area of the holding </p>

  <p>5.2 Reduction in water availability experienced on the holding</p>

  <p>5.3 Existence of organizations dealing with water allocation </p>

  <h3>6. Management of fertilizers</h3>

  <p><strong>Dimension: </strong>Environmental<strong> </strong></p>

  <p><strong>Theme: </strong>Fertilizer pollution risk </p>

  <p>Agriculture can affect the quality of the environment through excessive use
  or inadequate management of fertilizers. Sustainable agriculture implies that
  the level of chemicals in soil and water bodies remains within acceptable
  thresholds. Integrated plant nutrient management considers all sources of
  nutrients (mineral and organic) and their management in order to obtain best
  nutrient balance. Measuring soil and water quality captures the extent and
  causes of pollution, but establishing monitoring systems of soil and water is
  costly and not always feasible in countries. </p>

  <p>Note: the management of plant nutrients addresses two sustainability
  issues: avoiding pollution, and maintaining a good level of soil fertility.
  This sub-indicator addresses the first issue, while the second one is
  addressed under sub-indicator 4 &#x2018;Soil health&#x2019;. </p>

  <p><strong>Coverage: </strong>All farm types</p>

  <p><strong>Description: </strong></p>

  <p>The proposed approach is based on questions to farmers about their use of
  fertilizer, in particular mineral or synthetic fertilizers and animal manure,
  their awareness about the environmental risks associated with fertilizer and
  manure applications, and their behaviour in terms of plant nutrient
  management<sup><a href="#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10">[8]</a></sup>.
  Management measures considered to help reducing risk is as follows: </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Follow protocols as per extension service or retail outlet directions or local regulations, not exceeding recommended doses</li>
    <li>Use organic source of nutrients (including manure or composting residues) alone, or in combination with synthetic or mineral fertilizers </li>
    <li>Use legumes as a cover crop, or component of a multi/crop or pasture system to reduce fertilizer inputs</li>
    <li>Distribute synthetic or mineral fertilizer application over the growing period</li>
    <li>Consider soil type and climate<sup><a href="#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11">[9]</a></sup> in deciding fertilizer application doses and frequencies</li>
    <li>Use soil sampling at least every 5 years to perform nutrient budget calculations </li>
    <li>Perform site-specific nutrient management or precision farming<sup><a href="#footnote-12" id="footnote-ref-12">[10]</a></sup></li>
    <li>Use buffer strips along water courses.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Sustainability criteria: </p>

  <p>Farm sustainability in relation with fertilizer pollution risk will be
  assessed as follows: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Green (desirable): The farm takes specific measures to mitigate environmental risks (at least four from the list above). Default result for farms not using fertilizers<sup><a href="#footnote-13" id="footnote-ref-13">[11]</a></sup>. </li>
    <li>Yellow (acceptable): The farm uses fertilizers and takes at least two measures from the above list to mitigate environmental risks</li>
    <li>Red (unsustainable): The farm uses fertilizer and does not take any of the above specific measures to mitigate environmental risks associated with their use. </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>7. Management of pesticides</h3>

  <p><strong>Dimension: </strong>Environmental<strong> </strong></p>

  <p><strong>Theme: </strong>Pesticide risk</p>

  <p>Pesticides are important inputs in modern agriculture (crop and livestock),
  but if not well managed they can cause harm to people&#x2019;s health or to
  the environment. Practices associated with integrated pest management
  (IPM<sup><a href="#footnote-14" id="footnote-ref-14">[12]</a></sup>) exist
  that contribute to minimise risks associated with the use of pesticides and
  limit their impact on human health and on the environment. The International
  Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management defines best practice in pesticide
  management.</p>

  <p><strong>Coverage: </strong>All farm types</p>

  <p><strong>Description: </strong></p>

  <p>The proposed sub-indicator is based on information on the use of pesticides
  on the farms, the type of pesticide used and the type of measure(s) taken to
  mitigate the associated risks<sup><a href="#footnote-15"
  id="footnote-ref-15">[13]</a></sup>. It considers the possibility that the
  holding uses pesticides in the framework of an Integrated Pest Management
  (IPM) program, or adopts specific measures to help reducing risks associated
  with pesticide use. List of possible measures:</p>

  <p>Health</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Adherence to label directions for pesticide use (including use of protection equipment while applying pesticides)</li>
    <li>Maintenance and cleansing of protection equipment after use</li>
    <li>Safe disposal of waste (cartons, bottles and bags)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Environment</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Adherence to label directions for pesticide application</li>
    <li>Adopt any of the these good practices: adjust planting time, apply crop spacing, crop rotation, mixed cropping or inter-cropping </li>
    <li>Perform biological pest control or use biopesticides</li>
    <li>Adopt pasture rotation to suppress livestock pest population </li>
    <li>Systematic removal of plant parts attacked by pests</li>
    <li>Maintenance and cleansing of spray equipment after use</li>
    <li>Use one pesticide no more than two times or in mixture in a season to avoid pesticide resistance</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Sustainability criteria: </p>

  <p>Farm sustainability in relation with pesticides will be assessed as
  follows: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Green (desirable): The farm uses only moderately or slightly hazardous<sup><a href="#footnote-16" id="footnote-ref-16">[14]</a></sup> pesticides (WHO Class II or III). In this case, it adheres to all three health-related measures and at least four of the environment-related measures. Default result for farms not using pesticides.</li>
    <li>Yellow (acceptable): The farm uses only moderately or slightly hazardous pesticides (WHO Class II or III) and takes some measures to mitigate environmental and health risks (at least two from each of the lists above)</li>
    <li>Red (unsustainable): The farm uses highly or extremely hazardous pesticides (WHO Class Ia or Ib), illegal pesticides<sup><a href="#footnote-17" id="footnote-ref-17">[15]</a></sup>, or uses moderately or slightly hazardous pesticides without taking specific measures to mitigate environmental or health risks associated with their use (fewer than two from each of the lists above). </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Data items</strong></p>

  <p>Reference period: last calendar year</p>

  <p>7.1 Use of pesticides for crop or livestock by the agricultural holding

  </ol>

  <h3>8. Use of agro-biodiversity-supportive practices</h3>

  <p><strong>Dimension: </strong>Environmental<strong> </strong></p>

  <p><strong>Theme: </strong>Biodiversity </p>

  <p>The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) stresses the close
  relationship between agriculture activities and biodiversity, considering
  three levels of biodiversity: genetic level diversity; agrobiodiversity at
  production system level; and ecosystem level (wild) biodiversity. The way
  agriculture is practiced influences all three levels. Attempts to develop
  indicators of biodiversity for agriculture systematically consider a large
  number of sub-indicators, with no universally agreed sustainability criteria.
  Considering these constraints, and the importance of addressing biodiversity
  in the construction of Indicator 2.4.1, it is proposed to develop a
  sub-indicator that captures the efforts towards more sustainable agriculture
  that better contributes to biodiversity, by identifying a limited list of
  practices that are conducive to biodiversity conservation.</p>

  <p><strong>Coverage: </strong>All farm types<strong> </strong></p>

  <p><strong>Description: </strong></p>

  <p>This sub-indicator measures the level of adoption of more sustainable
  agricultural practices that better contribute to biodiversity by the farm at
  ecosystem, species and genetic levels. This indicator addresses both crops and
  livestock. Specifically, in case of this sub-indicator the scope is the entire
  area of the farm holding as opposed to the agricultural area that is used for
  rest of the 10 sub-indicators. </p>

  <p>In particular, two separate scoring systems depending on the applicability
  of the organic farming criterion have been proposed.</p>

  <p>Depending on whether organic certification system exists, countries will
  select one of the below two proposed set of criteria and thus will be
  evaluated/scored differently in terms of their sustainability status.
  According to this formulation, to secure green status, farms in countries with
  organic certification in place, will have to check 3 out of 6 criteria. On the
  contrary, farms operating in countries with no organic certification in place,
  will have to check 2 out of 5 criteria for obtaining the green status.</p>

  <p>The detailed formulation of the criteria for the 2 scoring systems is
  described below:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Criteria for group of countries with organic certification systems/schemes:</strong></li>
    <li>Leaves at least 10% of the holding area for natural or diverse vegetation. This can include natural pasture/grassland, maintaining wildflower strips, stone and wood heaps, trees or hedgerows, natural ponds or wetlands. </li>
    <li>Farm produces agricultural products that are organically certified, or its products are undergoing the certification process. </li>
    <li>Farm does not use medically important antimicrobials as growth promoters.</li>
    <li>At least two of the following contribute to farm production: 1) temporary crops, 2) pasture, 3) permanent crops, 4) trees on farm, 5) livestock or animal products, and 6) aquaculture.</li>
    <li>Practices crop or crop/pasture rotation involving at least 2 crops or crops and pastures on at least 80% of the farm agriculture area (excluding permanent crops and permanent pastures) over a period of 3 years. In case of a 2-crop rotation, the 2 crops have to be from different plant genus, e.g. a grass plus a legume, or a grass plus a tuber etc.<strong> </strong></li>
    <li>Livestock includes locally adapted breeds.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Sustainability status:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <ul>
        <li>Green (desirable): The agricultural holding meets at least three of the above criteria </li>
        <li>Yellow (acceptable): The agricultural holding meets one or two of the above criteria</li>
        <li>Red (unsustainable): The agricultural holding meets none of the above criteria</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Criteria for group of countries with no organic certification systems/schemes:</strong></li>
    <li>Leaves at least 10% of the holding area for natural or diverse vegetation. This can include natural pasture/grassland, maintaining wildflower strips, stone and wood heaps, trees or hedgerows, natural ponds or wetlands. </li>
    <li>Farm does not use medically important antimicrobials as growth promoters.</li>
    <li>At least two of the following contribute to farm production: 1) temporary crops, 2) pasture, 3) permanent crops, 4) trees on farm, 5) livestock or animal products, and 6) aquaculture</li>
    <li>Practices crop or crop/pasture rotation involving at least 2 crops or crops and pastures on at least 80% of the farm cultivated area (excluding permanent crops and permanent pastures) over a period of 3 years. In case of a 2-crop rotation, the 2 crops have to be from different plant genus, e.g. a grass plus a legume, or a grass plus a tuber etc. </li>
    <li>Livestock includes locally adapted breeds.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Sustainability status:</strong></p>

  <h3>9. Wage rate in agriculture</h3>

  <p><strong>Dimension: </strong>Social </p>

  <p><strong>Theme: </strong>Decent employment</p>

  <p>The theme provide information on the remuneration of employees working for
  the farm and belonging to the elementary occupation group, as defined by the
  International Standard Classification of Occupation (ISCO-08 - code 92). It
  informs about economic risks faced by unskilled workers (those performing
  simple and routine tasks) in terms of remuneration received, the later
  benchmarked against the minimum wage set at national level in the agricultural
  sector. This sub-indicator allows distinguishing between holdings that pay a
  fair remuneration to its employees under the elementary occupation group, and
  agricultural holdings paying a remuneration to their employees belonging to
  the elementary occupation group that is below the minimum wage standard. In
  the latter case, agricultural holdings are deemed to be non-sustainable since
  the remuneration paid is not sufficient to ensure a decent living
  standard.</p>

  <p><strong>Coverage: </strong>Not applicable to farms that employ only family
  labour.</p>

  <p><strong>Description: </strong></p>

  <p>The sub-indicator measures the farm unskilled labour daily wage rate in
  Local Currency Units (LCU).</p>

  <h3>10. Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES)</h3>

  <p><strong>Dimension: </strong>Social </p>

  <p><strong>Theme: </strong>Food security </p>

  <p>FIES is a metric of severity of food insecurity at the household level that
  relies on people&#x2019;s direct yes/no responses to eight simple questions
  regarding their access to adequate food. It is a statistical measurement scale
  similar to other widely-accepted statistical scales designed to measure
  unobservable traits such as aptitude/intelligence, personality, and a broad
  range of social, psychological and health-related conditions. </p>

  <p><strong>Coverage: </strong>Only household farms </p>

  <p><strong>Description: </strong></p>

  <p>The Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) produces a measure of the
  severity of food insecurity experienced by individuals or households, based on
  direct interviews.</p>

  <p>The FIES questions refer to the experiences of the individual respondent or
  of the respondent&#x2019;s household as a whole. The questions focus on
  self-reported food-related behaviors and experiences associated with
  increasing difficulties in accessing food due to resource constraints. </p>

  <p>The FIES is derived from two widely-used experience-based food security
  scales: the U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module and the Latin American
  and Caribbean Food Security Scale (Spanish acronym ELCSA). It consists of a
  set of eight short yes/no questions asked directly to people. The questions
  focus on self-reported, food-related behaviours and experiences associated
  with increasing difficulties in accessing food due to resource constraints.
  The FIES is based on a well-grounded construct of the experience of food
  insecurity composed of three domains: uncertainty/anxiety, changes in food
  quality, and changes in food quantity.</p>

  <p>This sub-indicator is SDG indicator 2.1.2, contextualised for a farm
  survey. </p>

  <p><strong>Sustainability criteria: </strong>Level on FIES scale</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Green (desirable): Mild food insecurity<sup><a href="#footnote-18" id="footnote-ref-18">[16]</a></sup> </li>
    <li>Yellow (acceptable)<sup><a href="#footnote-19" id="footnote-ref-19">[17]</a></sup>: Moderate food insecurity </li>
    <li>Red (unsustainable): Severe food insecurity </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Data items</strong></p>

  <p>Reference period: last 12 months</p>

  <p>10.1 The respondent&#x2019;s recollection that he/she (or any other adult
  in the household) would be worried about not having enough food to eat due to
  lack of money or other resources</p>

  <p>10.2 The respondent&#x2019;s recollection that he/she (or any adult in the
  household) was unable to eat healthy and nutritious food because of lack of
  money or other resources</p>

  <p>10.3 The respondent&#x2019;s recollection that he/she (or any adult in the
  household) only ate a few kinds of food due to lack of money or other
  resources</p>

  <p>10.4 The respondent&#x2019;s recollection that he/she (or any adult in the
  household) had to skip a meal because there was no enough money or other
  resources for food</p>

  <p>10.5 The respondent&#x2019;s recollection that he/she (or any adult in the
  household) ate less than he/she thought he should due to lack of money or
  other resources</p>

  <p>10.6 The respondent&#x2019;s recollection that his/her household ran out of
  food because of a lack of money or other resources</p>

  <p>10.7 The respondent&#x2019;s recollection that he/she (or any adult in the
  household) was hungry but not eating due to lack of money or other resources
  for food</p>

  <p>10.8 The respondent&#x2019;s recollection that he/she (or any adult in the
  household) did not eat for a whole day because of a lack of money or other
  resources</p>

  <h3>11. Secure tenure rights to land</h3>

  <p><strong>Dimension: </strong>Social </p>

  <p><strong>Theme: </strong>Land tenure</p>

  <p>The sub-indicator allows assessing sustainability in terms of rights over
  use of agricultural land areas. Since agricultural land is a key input for
  agricultural production, having secure rights over land ensures that the
  agricultural holding controls such a key asset and does not risk losing the
  land used by the holding for farming. </p>

  <p>Evidence shows that farmers tend to be less productive if they have limited
  access to and control of economic resources and services, particularly land.
  Long-lasting inequalities of economic and financial resources have positioned
  certain farmers at a disadvantage relative to others in their ability to
  participate in, contribute to and benefit from broader processes of
  development. </p>

  <p>As such, adequate distribution of economic resources, particularly land,
  help ensure equitable economic growth, contributes to economic efficiency and
  has a positive impact on key development outcomes, including poverty
  reduction, food security and the welfare of households.</p>

  <p>This sub-indicator is SDG indicator 5.a.1, customised for SDG indicator
  2.4.1. </p>

  <p><strong>Coverage: </strong>All farms types<strong> </strong></p>

  <p><strong>Description: </strong></p>

  <p>The sub-indicator measures the ownership or secure rights over use of
  agricultural land areas using the following criteria:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Formal document issued by the Land Registry/Cadastral Agency </li>
    <li>Name of the holder listed as owner/use right holder on legally recognized documents</li>
    <li>Rights to sell any of the parcel of the holding</li>
    <li>Rights to bequeath any of the parcel of the holding</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Sustainability criteria: </strong></p>

  <p>Level of security of access to land.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Green (desirable): has a formal document with the name of the holder/holding on it, or has the right to sell any of the parcel of the holding, or has the right to bequeath any of the parcel of the holding</li>
    <li>Yellow (acceptable): has a formal document even if the name of the holder/holding is not on it</li>
    <li>Red (unsustainable): no positive responses to any of the 4 questions above</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Data items</strong></p>

  <p>Reference period: last calendar year</p>
