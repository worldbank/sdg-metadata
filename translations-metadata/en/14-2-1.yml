  <p>Regional Seas Coordinated Indicator 22 &#x2018;Integrated Coastal Zone
  Management&#x2019; (ICZM) is proposed as the primary indicator. For countries
  with Marine/Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) in place, these plans can be
  helpful to assess ICZM. For other countries, it is important to identify ways
  to measure existing plans and to build capacity for integrated planning. </p>

  <p>An Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) plan covers the entire coastal
  zone. Marine and terrestrial areas are managed together. Plans are developed
  through coordination across different marine and terrestrial institutions and
  agencies.</p>

  <p>Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) is focused on the Exclusive Economic Zone
  (EEZ). It integrates the needs and policies of multiple marine sectors into
  one coherent planning framework.</p>

  <p>The Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is an area beyond and adjacent to the
  territorial sea. The EEZ shall not extend beyond 200 nautical miles from the
  baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured, as
  outlined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.</p>

  <p>Territorial sea is a belt of coastal waters extending at most 12 nautical
  miles from the baseline of a coastal state, as outlined by the United Nations
  Convention on the Law of the Sea.</p>

INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) was mandated as Custodian
  Agencies for indicator 14.2.1 by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG
  Indicators.</p>

  <p>The <a
  href="https://www.unep.org/explore-topics/oceans-seas/what-we-do/regional-seas-programme">UNEP
  Regional Seas Programme</a> is UNEP&#x2019;s most important regional mechanism
  for conservation of the marine and coastal environment since its establishment
  in 1974. These Multilateral Environmental Agreements are governed by their own
  meetings of the Contracting Parties. The individual Regional Seas Conventions
  and Action Plans have both a normative and implementation mandate. They
  provide an expression of common regional priorities, including those in the
  delivery of global mandates such as the 2030 Agenda, provisions of
  Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) and United Nations Environment
  Assembly (UNEA) resolutions. They also provide platforms for acting, including
  through integrated assessment, policy development, capacity building and
  exchange, as well as through implementation of projects. By building on the
  mandates of Regional Seas in addressing adverse impacts to the marine and
  coastal environment, UNEP can enhance impact and sustainability of efforts by
  utilization of advantages of the Regional Seas under the programme of work at
  the regional level.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p> Oceans are an important part of the global system and covering more than
  70 per cent of the Earth&#x2019;s surface. They provide food and livelihoods
  for billions of people, absorb atmospheric heat and more than a quarter of
  carbon dioxide, and produce about half of the oxygen in the atmosphere. </p>

  <p>Due to human activities, global climate change and environmental problems
  have led to threats to marine ecosystems and environments. It is important to
  identify ways to measure existing plans and to build capacity for integrated
  planning.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The indicator only measures the policy formulation and not policy
  implementation.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The full methodology for this indicator is available in the document
  entitled &#x201C;<a
  href="https://wedocs.unep.org/handle/20.500.11822/35086">Understanding the
  State of the Ocean: A Global Manual on Measuring SDG 14.1.1, SDG 14.2.1 and
  SDG 14.5.1</a>&#x201D; (UNEP, 2021).</p>

  <p>This indicator aims to capture Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM)
  and other area-based, integrated planning and management in place in waters
  under national jurisdiction, including exclusive economic zones (e.g.
  marine/maritime spatial planning, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), marine
  zoning, sector specific management plans).</p>

  <p>To score this indicator, countries should: </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Identify national authorities/agencies/organisations responsible for coastal and marine/maritime planning and management.</li>
    <li>Identify and spatially map the boundaries of ICZM plans or other plans at national, sub-national and local level. Coordinate with the national authorities/agencies/organisations responsible for coastal and marine/maritime planning and management to complete a questionnaire on the ICZM plans.</li>
    <li>Determine the status of implementation of each plan, and categorise the spatial map according to implementation stages:</li>
  </ol>

  <p>1) Initial plan preparation.</p>

  <p>2) Plan development.</p>

  <p>3) Plan adoption/designation.</p>

  <p>4) Implementation and adaptive management.</p>

  <p>It is recommended that the collected responses include a spatial map
  showing the boundaries of relevant plans. </p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Regional Seas will
  be carried out extensive data validation procedures that include built-in
  automated procedures, manual checks and cross-references to national sources
  of data. Communication is carried out with countries for clarification and
  validation of data. Only data that are considered accurate or those confirmed
  by countries during the validation process are reported by UNEP on the SDG
  Global Database.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: <p>No adjustments are made.</p>

  <p>The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Regional Seas do
  not make any estimation or imputation for missing values, so the number of

  <p>The data will be aggregated at the sub-regional, regional and global levels
