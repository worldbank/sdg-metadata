  <p>Regional Seas Coordinated Indicator 22 &#x2018;Integrated Coastal Zone
  Management (ICZM) is proposed as the primary indicator. For countries with
  Marine/Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) in place, these plans can be helpful to
  assess ICZM. For other countries, it is important to identify ways to measure
  existing plans and to build capacity for integrated planning. All data for
  this indicator will be based on country submissions to the Regional Seas
  Programme. </p>

  <p>In order to promote the use of the Regional Seas as part of the follow-up
  and review mechanism for the Regional Seas, UNEP drafted report on how
  Regional Seas data could be directly used for the SDGs (see
  https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/27295/ocean_SDG.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y).</p>

  <p>A full methodology for this indicator is available in the document
  entitled, &#x201C;Global Manual on Ocean Statistics for Measuring SDG 14.1.1,
  14.2.1 and 14.5.1&#x201D;.</p>

  <p>Concepts:</p>

  <p>ICZM &#x2013; An Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) plan covers the
  entire coastal zone. Marine and terrestrial areas are managed together. Plans
  are developed through coordination across different marine and terrestrial
  institutions and agencies.</p>

  <p>Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) &#x2013; Marine Spatial Planning is focused
  on the EEZ. It the integrates the needs and policies of multiple marine
  sectors in one coherent planning framework.</p>

  <p>EEZ - national Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (200 nautical miles from the
  coast) as outlined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>From an ecological perspective, ecosystem approaches consider the
  connections between the living organisms, habitats, physical and chemical
  conditions within an ecosystem, focusing on the importance of ecological
  integrity, biodiversity and overall ecosystem health. From a management
  perspective, ecosystem-based approaches refer to integrated management
  strategies for socio-ecological systems that consider ecological, social and
  economic factors and apply principles of sustainable development. </p>

  <p>A marine or coastal area-based (or spatial) management promotes better
  management of EEZs. Many countries use Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) and
  Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) as their approach for ensuring
  appropriate ecosystem-based management, including issues that are
  cross-sectoral and wider scale in nature.</p>

  <p>Regional Seas Coordinated Indicator 22 &#x2018;Integrated Coastal Zone
  Management (ICZM) is proposed as the primary indicator. For countries with
  Marine/Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) in place, these plans can be helpful to
  assess ICZM. For other countries, it is important to identify ways to measure
  existing plans and to build capacity for integrated planning. All data for
  this indicator will be based on country submissions to the Regional Seas
  Programme. </p>

  <p>This indicator will measure the number of countries using ecosystem-based
  approaches to manage marine areas (measured through ICZM (Integrated Coastal
  Zone Management), marine spatial plan or other area-based, integrated planning
  and management in place.</p>

  <p>Step one </p>

  <p>Identify national authorities/agencies/organisations responsible for
  coastal and marine/maritime planning and management.</p>

  <p>Step two </p>

  <p>Identify and spatially map the boundaries of ICZM plans or other plans at
  national, sub-national and local level. Coordinate with the national
  authorities/agencies/organisations responsible for coastal and marine/maritime
  planning and management to complete a questionnaire on the ICZM plans (Shipman
  and Petit 2014)).</p>

  <p>Step three</p>

  <p>Determine the status of implementation of each plan, and categorise the
  spatial map according to implementation stages:</p>

  <p>1) Initial plan preparation</p>

  <p>2) Plan development</p>

  <p>3) Plan adoption/designation</p>

  <p>4) Implementation and adaptive management</p>

  <p>Collect the questionnaire responses and document the answers is
  recommended. The spatial map showing the boundaries of relevant plans
  (produced in step two) could also be used to calculate the proportion of
  national waters, or national exclusive economic zone, covered by relevant
  plans. This can be done by overlaying the spatial layer of relevant plans with
  a spatial layer of national waters, or of the exclusive economic zone, to
  identify where the two layers coincide. </p>

  <p>All countries should report on if a plan is in place. </p>

  <p>Time series:</p>

  <p>National data collection through the Regional Seas already exists for many
  Regional Seas, this data will be compiled for SDG reporting in 2020. Reporting
  will be every 5 years &#x2013; as policy development takes time.</p>

  <p>Disaggregation:</p>

  <p>&#x2022; A geospatial map of areas covered by a plan is recommended for
  national level decision making.</p>
