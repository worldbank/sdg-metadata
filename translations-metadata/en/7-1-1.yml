  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>Proportion of population with access to electricity is the percentage of
  population with access to electricity.</p>

  <p>SDG7 ensures access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy
  for all. Specifically, Indicator 7.1.1 refers to the proportion of population
  with access to electricity. This is expressed in percentage figures and is
  disaggregated by total, urban and rural access rates per country, as well as
  by UN regional and global classifications. </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>Electricity access in this scenario refers to the proportion of population
  in the considered area (country, region, and global context) that has access
  to consistent sources of electricity. </p>

  <p>The World Bank&#x2019;s Global Electrification Database compiles nationally
  representative household survey data as well as census data since 1990. It
  also incorporates data from the Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and
  the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa Poverty Database, and the
  Europe and Central Asia Poverty Database, all of which are based on similar
  surveys. </p>
UNIT_MEASURE: <p>Percent (%)</p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: |-
  <ul>
    <li>Regional and global classifications refer to the list of standard country or area codes for statistical use (M49) provided by the United Nations Statistics Division </li>
    <li>Country classification by income group is based on the World Bank Country and Lending Groups. </li>
    <li>Country population data are extracted from the World Development Indicators. </li>
  </ul>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Data for access to electricity are collected from household surveys and
  censuses, tapping into a wide number of different household survey types
  including: Multi-tier Framework (MTF), Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)
  and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS), Multi-Indicator Cluster
  Surveys (MICS), the World Health Survey (WHS), other nationally developed and
  implemented surveys, including those by various government agencies (for
  example, ministries of energy and utilities).</p>

  <p>The World Bank is the agency that has taken responsibility for compiling a
  meta-database of statistics on electricity access harvested from the full
  global body of household surveys. The World Bank Electrification Database
  covers more than 219 countries for the period from 1990 and is updated
  regularly.</p>

  <p>For more information on compiling access to energy data see Global Tracking
  Framework report (2013) (Chapter 2, Annex 2, page 127-129).</p>

  <p>Reports produced by international agencies such as the UN, World Bank,
  USAID, National Statistics Offices, as well as country censuses are used to
  collect data. Though some of the reports might not directly focus on energy
  access, they tend to include questions regarding access to electricity. Also,
  for the sake of consistency in methodology across countries, government and
  utility data are not considered. </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>If data sources have any information on electricity access, it is collected
  and analysed in line with the previous trends and future projections of each
  country. Data validation is conducted by checking that the figures are
  reflective of the ground level scenario as well as are in line with country
  populations, income levels and electrification programs. </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>The database collected from household surveys and censuses is updated
  annually for the second half of the year.</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: <p>The annual release of new data for SDG7.1.1 is usually in early June.</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>It varies according to the country and its context. Data are collected from

INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>Along with the SDG 7 custodian agencies, including the International Energy
  Agency (IEA), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the United
  Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), and the World Health Organization (WHO),
  the World Bank is designated by the UN Statistical Commission to collect,
  process, and disseminate data with regional, and global aggregates, in
  relation to the progress in achieving the SDG 7 goal. During the process of
  updating and disseminating the electrification database, as a consultation
  organization, the World Bank is responsible for acting in consultation with
  internal stakeholders, national statistics agencies, and the UN regional
  commissions. </p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Access to electricity addresses major critical issues in all the dimensions
  of sustainable development. The target has a wide range of social and economic
  impacts, including facilitating development of income generating activities
  and lightening the burden of household tasks.</p>

  <p>Under the global target of equal access to energy, SDG7.1.1 focuses
  specifically on electricity access available to the global population. In
  order to gain a clear picture, access rates are only considered if the primary
  source of lighting is the local electricity provider, solar systems,
  mini-grids and stand-alone systems. Sources such as generators, candles,
  batteries, etc., are not considered due to their limited working capacities
  and since they are usually kept as backup sources for lighting.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The World Bank aims to estimate demand side access rates in order to better
  understand the access levels experienced by the population. This is different
  from the supply side access rates usually provided by governments, ministries,
  etc. The data are primarily compiled from national household surveys and
  censuses. But since these are carried out infrequently, it is difficult to
  understand the ground level trends for short term periods. Collecting data for
  rural areas as well as last-mile connectivity problems also cause errors in
  data collection that could skew results. </p>

  <p>While the existing global household survey evidence base provides a good
  starting point for tracking household energy access, it also presents several
  limitations that will need to be addressed over time. In many parts of the
  world, the presence of an electricity connection in the household does not
  necessarily guarantee that the energy supplied is adequate in quality and
  reliability or affordable in cost and it would be desirable to have fuller
  information about these critical attributes of the service, which have been
  highlighted in SDG7.</p>

  <p>Substantial progress has already been made toward developing and piloting a
  new methodology known as the Multi-Tier Framework for Measuring Energy Access
  (World Bank) which is able to capture these broader dimensions of service
  quality and would make it possible to go beyond a simple yes/no measure of
  energy access to a more refined approach that recognizes different levels of
  energy access, and also takes into account the affordability and reliability
  of energy access explicitly referenced in the language of SDG7. The
  methodology for the Multi-Tier Framework for Measuring Energy Access has
  already been published based on a broad consultative exercise and represents a
  consensus view across numerous international agencies working in the field.
  Discussions are also progressing with the World Bank&#x2019;s Household Survey
  Technical Working Group regarding the mainstreaming of this methodology into
  the standardized household questionnaire design that will be applied every
  three years in all low-income countries between 2015 and 2030 as part of the
  broader SDG monitoring exercise.</p>

  <p>The adoption of this methodology will allow &#x2013; over time &#x2013; the
  more refined measurement of energy access, making it possible to report more
  disaggregated information regarding the type of electricity supply (grid or
  off-grid), the capacity of electricity supply provided (in Watts), the
  duration of service (daily hours and evening hours), the reliability of
  service (in terms of number and length of unplanned service interruptions),
  the quality of service (in terms of voltage fluctuations), as well as
  affordability and legality of service.</p>

  <p>Another advantage of this approach is that they can be applied not only to
  measuring energy access at the household level, but also its availability to
  support enterprises and deliver critical community services, such as health
  and education.</p>

  <p>Methodological challenges associated with the measurement of energy access
  are more fully described in the Global Tracking Framework (2013) (Chapter 2,
  Section 1, page 75-82), and in the ESMAP (2015) Report &#x201C;Beyond
  Connections: Energy Access Redefined&#x201D; both of which are referenced
  below.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>To estimate values, <a
  href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3701999/pdf/ehp.1205987.pdf">a
  multilevel nonparametric modelling approach</a>&#x2014;developed by the World
  Health Organization to estimate clean fuel usage&#x2014;was adapted to predict
  electricity access and used to fill in the missing data points for the time
  period from 1990 onwards. Where data is available, access estimates are
  weighted by population. Multilevel nonparametric modelling considers the
  hierarchical structure of data (country and regional levels), using the
  regional classification of the United Nations. </p>

  <p>The model is applied for all countries with at least one data point. In
  order to use as much real data as possible, results based on real survey data
  are reported in their original form for all years available. The statistical
  model is used to fill in data only for years where they are missing and to
  conduct global and regional analyses. In the absence of survey data for a
  given year, information from regional trends was borrowed. The difference
  between real data points and estimated values is clearly identified in the
  database. </p>

  <p>Countries classified as &#x201C;High Income&#x201D; based on the World Bank
  Country and Lending Groups are assumed to reach universal access from the
  first year the country joined the category. </p>

  <p>In the present report, to avoid having electrification trends from 1990 to
  2010 overshadow electrification efforts since 2010, the model was run twice:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>With survey data and assumptions from 1990 to the latest year for model estimates from 1990 to the latest year</li>
    <li>With survey data and assumptions from 2010 to the latest year for model estimates from 2010 to the latest year </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Given the low frequency and the regional distribution of some surveys,
  several countries have gaps in available data. To develop the historical
  evolution and starting point of electrification rates, a simple modelling
  approach was adopted to fill in the missing data points. This modelling
  approach allowed the estimation of electrification rates for 219 countries
  over the time periods. The SE4ALL Global Tracking Framework Report (2013)
  referenced below provides more details on the suggested methodology for
  tracking access to energy (Chapter 2, Section 1, page 82-87).</p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>After completing data compilation, the World Bank initially contacted each
  energy team for highly strategic countries or some countries with data
  discrepancy issues. Following the initial round, the World Bank coordinates
  with internal stakeholders and the UN regional commissions to validate the
  accuracy of the data. In this process, the World Bank is in charge of
  responding to any inquiries and comments. </p>
ADJUSTMENT: <p>Not applicable</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <ul>
    <li><strong>At country level</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Given the low frequency and regional distribution of some surveys, many
  countries have gaps in data availability. A simple modelling approach was
  adopted to fill in the missing data points, in order to develop the historical
  evolution and starting point of the electrification rates. The estimation is
  conducted using a model with region, country and time variables. The model
  keeps the original observation if data is available. The statistical model is
  used to fill in data only for years where they are missing and to help conduct
  global and regional analyses. In the absence of survey data for a given year,
  information from regional trends was borrowed. The estimated values are
  clearly identified (&#x201C;Estimate&#x201D;) in the database. In the
  meantime, if a country value indicates a high discrepancy compared with either
  IEA data or data from the past publication, the country is considered as an
  outlier and not affected by the regional trends. As a result, such countries
  only have their country effects in model estimates. </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>At regional and global levels</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Values for regional and global levels are calculated by incorporating all
  survey data along with model-estimated values substituting missing values.
  Regional and global classifications are based on the UN M49 series for
  statistical use.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Regional and global data are population-weighted by summing up all
  available values across countries listed in the UN regional classification.
  </p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>Countries generally use internationally accepted methods of conducting
  censuses and national surveys. There is some level of disparity between
  countries and regional methodologies, but the efforts to harmonize data is
  improving. The Multi-Tier Framework (MTF) by the World Bank is one such method
  being used to increase accuracy of data collection.</p>
QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>A non-parametric model is consistently used to obtain a complete set of
  annual trends of electricity access rates by fulfilling the data gaps with
  model estimates. The model draws from solid fuel use modelling used in Bonjour
  et al (2013). The model closely follows empirical data without being
  influenced by large fluctuations in survey estimates. In general, regional
  trends are borrowed for the absence of survey data. However, some countries,
  which have significant discrepancies with IEA data, are considered as an
  outlier, not reflecting the regional trends, but just relying on their country
  effects.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>A multi-level review process in collaboration with industry experts,
  national statistical offices, country and regional experts as well as
  partnering international agencies and UN bodies is conducted before finalizing
  the data.</p>

  <p>Before finalizing electricity access data, the World Bank team contacts the
  relevant national statistical offices and the UN regional commissions asking
  for reviews and suggestions for the prepared figures. The database also goes
  through multiple rounds of vetting process internally through departments. The
  relevant links are provided below under References.</p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>Good quality data of electricity access should be generally aligned with
  the trends from the past data at country level. Also, the World Bank&#x2019;s
  data results would not have high discrepancies about more than 5 percentage
  points with IEA data, although the World Bank (based on standardized household
  surveys and censuses) and IEA (based on government-reported values) maintain
  separate database of global electricity access rates. Meanwhile, given the
  consultation with internal stakeholders and the UN regional commissions, data
  points of some countries are adjusted to reflect their certain circumstances,
  such as national conflict. Therefore, for these countries, the access rate is
  not linearly increased.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>Data have been collected from 1990 through the latest year on an annual
  basis. </p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>Data for countries have been compiled from 1990 to the latest year, but
  there are gaps in accurate data availability.</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>Electricity access rates are disaggregated by geographic location into
  total, urban and rural rates. Countries that are classified as &#x201C;High
  Income&#x201D; are assumed to reach universal access from the first year it
  was added to the category. Disaggregation of access to electricity by rural or
  urban place of residence is available at country, regional and global
  levels.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>The World Bank database compiles electricity usage data, while many
  international agencies and national ministries report electricity production
  data. This is the main cause for data discrepancies. The quality and accuracy
  of population data can also lead to differences in assessing
  electrification.</p>
