  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>Proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as
  a share of total household expenditure or income. </p>

  <p>Two thresholds are used to define &#x201C;large household expenditure on
  health&#x201D;: greater than 10% and greater than 25% of total household
  expenditure or income.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>Indicator 3.8.2 is defined as the &#x201C;Proportion of the population with
  large household expenditure on health as a share of total household
  expenditure or income&#x201D;. In effect it is based on a ratio exceeding a
  threshold. The two main concepts of interest behind this ratio are household
  expenditure on health (numerator) and total household consumption expenditure
  or, when unavailable, income (denominator). </p>

  <p><strong><em>Numerator</em></strong></p>

  <p>Household expenditure on health is defined as any expenditure incurred at
  the time of service use to get any type of care (promotive, preventive,
  curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long-term care) including all
  medicines, vaccines and other pharmaceutical preparations as well as all
  health products, <em>from any type of provider and for all members of the
  household</em>. These health expenditures are characterized by a direct
  payments that are financed by a household&#x2019;s income (including
  remittances), savings or loans <strong>but do not include any third-party
  payer reimbursement. </strong>As such they only grant access to the health
  services and health products individuals can pay for, without any solidarity
  between the healthy and the sick beyond the household<sup><sup><a
  href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[1]</a></sup></sup> and solely based on
  the willingness and ability of the household to pay. Direct health care
  payments are labelled Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) payments in the classification of
  health care financing schemes (HF) of the international Classification for
  Health Accounts (ICHA). OOP health expenditures are the most unequitable
  source of funding for the health system. </p>

  <p>The components of a household&#x2019;s health care consumption expenditure
  so defined should be consistent with division 06 on health of the UN
  Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP) which
  currently includes expenditures on medicines and medical products (06.1),
  outpatient care services (06.2) and inpatient care services (06.3) but is
  being expanded<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3"
  id="footnote-ref-3">[2]</a></sup></sup>.</p>

  <p>Further information on definitions and classifications (for example by
  provider, by beneficiary characteristics) of health expenditures should be
  consistent with the <a
  href="http://www.who.int/health-accounts/methodology/en/"><u>international
  classification for health accounts</u></a> and its family of classifications.
  ICHA results from collaboration between OECD, Eurostat and the World Health
  Organization. </p>

  <p><strong><em>Denominator</em></strong></p>

  <p>Expenditure on household consumption and household income are both monetary
  welfare measures. Household consumption is a function of permanent income,
  which is a measure of a household&#x2019;s long-term economic resources that
  determine living standards. Consumption is generally defined as the sum of the
  monetary values of all items (goods and services) consumed by the household on
  domestic account during a reference period. It includes the imputed values of
  goods and services that are not purchased but procured otherwise for
  consumption. Information on household consumption is usually collected in
  household surveys that may use different approaches to measure
  &#x2018;consumption&#x2019; depending on whether items refer to durable or
  non-durable goods and/or are directly produced by households.</p>

  <p>The most relevant measure of income is disposable income as it is close to
  the maximum available to the household for consumption expenditure during the
  accounting period. Disposable income is defined as total income less direct
  taxes (net of refunds), compulsory fees and fines. Total income is generally
  composed of income from employment, property income, income from household
  production of services for own consumption, transfers received in cash and
  goods, transfers received as services<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-4"
  id="footnote-ref-4">[3]</a></sup></sup>. </p>

  <p>Income is more difficult to measure accurately due to its greater
  variability over time. Consumption is less variable over time and easier to
  measure. It is therefore recommended that whenever there is information on
  both household consumption and income the former is used (see the
  &#x201C;comments and limitations&#x201D; section to learn more about the
  sensitivity of 3.8.2 to the income/expenditure choice in the denominator).
  Statistics on 3.8.2 currently produced by WHO and the World Bank predominantly
  rely on consumption (see section on data sources). </p>

  <p><strong><em>Thresholds</em></strong></p>

  <p>It is recommended to use two thresholds for global reporting to identify
  large household expenditure on health as share of total household consumption
  or income<u>: </u><strong><u>a lower threshold of 10% (3.8.2_10) and a higher
  threshold of 25% (3.8.2_25)</u></strong>. With these two thresholds the
  indicator measures financial hardship </p>

  <p> (see section on comments and limitations). </p><div

SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The recommended data sources for the monitoring of the &#x201C;Proportion
  of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of
  total household expenditure or income&#x201D; are household surveys with
  information on both household consumption expenditure on health and total
  household consumption expenditures, which are routinely conducted by national
  statistical offices. Household budget surveys (HBS) and household income and
  expenditure surveys (HIES) typically collect these as they are primarily
  conducted to provide inputs to the calculation of consumer price indices or
  the compilation of national accounts. Another potential source of information
  is socio-economic or living standards surveys; however, some of these surveys
  may not collect information on total household consumption expenditures
  &#x2013; for example, when a country measures poverty using income as the
  welfare measure<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-5"
  id="footnote-ref-5">[4]</a></sup></sup>. The most important criterion for
  selecting a data source to measure SDG indicator 3.8.2 is the availability of
  both household consumption expenditure on health and total household
  consumption expenditures.</p>

  <p>When socio-economic or living standards surveys are used to measure SDG
  indicator 3.8.2, any challenge for cross-country comparability of SDG
  Indicator 1.1.1 also applies to the monitoring of SDG indicator 3.8.2. For any
  type of household survey, given the focus on household health expenditure
  there is a need to improve the current survey instruments for cross-country
  comparability. The World Health Organization is collaborating with different
  UN agencies and other important stakeholder to ensure this happens<sup><sup><a

COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>WHO obtains household survey data from national statistical offices where
  the denominator and numerator of the health expenditure ratio is constructed
  following their own guidelines either directly by them or by WHO consultants.
  WHO works through its regional offices or country offices to obtain access to
  data. No systematic adjustment is undertaken. </p>

  <p>The World Bank also typically receives data from National Statistical
  Offices (NSOs) directly. In other cases it uses NSO data received indirectly.
  For example, it receives data from Eurostat and from LIS (Luxembourg Income
  Study), who provide the World Bank NSO data they have received / harmonized.
  The Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina and the World Bank jointly
  maintain the SEDLAC (Socio-Economic Database for Latin American and Caribbean)
  database that includes harmonized statistics on poverty and other
  distributional and social variables from 24 Latin American and Caribbean
  countries, based on microdata from household surveys conducted by NSOs. Data
  is obtained through country specific programs, including technical assistance
  programs and joint analytical and capacity building activities. The World Bank
  has relationships with NSOs on work programs involving statistical systems and
  data analysis. Poverty economists from the World Bank typically engage with
  NSOs broadly on poverty measurement and analysis as part of technical
  assistance activities. </p>

  <p>The World Health Organization and the World Bank generate indicator 3.8.2
  following the same approach (see methodology). Both institutions combine
  estimates at the meso-level. Eligibility of the estimates included in a joint
  global database for the production of regional and global estimates is based
  on the following quality checks:</p>

  <p><em>For the denominator of the health expenditure ratio</em></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Compare the logarithm of total per capita consumption in a benchmark source with the logarithm of total per capita consumption estimated from the survey. Both are expressed on a monthly basis in 2011 international (PPP) $. The benchmark source is taken from Povcalnet<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7">[6]</a></sup></sup> if available, and otherwise from the World Development Indicators (WDI)<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8">[7]</a></sup></sup>, computed as the household final consumption expenditures in constant 2011 international divided by total population. When the difference between the logarithm of total per capita consumption in the benchmark source and the logarithm of the value estimated from the survey as a share of the logarithm of total per capita consumption in the benchmark is greater than 10% when the comparison is with PovcalNet and greater than 15% when the comparison is made with the WDI the survey point is identified as an outlier internationally in terms of consumption per capita. </li>
    <li>Compare the poverty headcount estimated from the survey at the $1.90 a day poverty line in 2011 PPPs with the poverty incidence reported in PovcalNet at the same poverty line (benchmark value). When the absolute difference between the benchmark value and the survey estimate exceeds 10 percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in the incidence of extreme poverty and flagged for possible exclusion. </li>
    <li>Compare the poverty headcount estimated from the survey at the $3.10 a day poverty line in 2011 PPPs with the poverty incidence reported in PovcalNet at the same poverty line (benchmark value). When the absolute difference between the benchmark value and the survey estimate exceeds 10 percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in poverty headcount at $3.10 a day and flagged for possible exclusion.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>For the numerator of the health expenditure ratio</em></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Compare the average health expenditure ratio in the survey to a benchmark average budget share constructed as the ratio of the aggregate measure of household out-of-pocket expenditures in current local currency and aggregate household final consumption expenditure in current local currency. When the absolute difference exceeds 5 percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in terms of household budget share spent on health and flagged for possible exclusion. The macro-indicator of household out-of-pocket expenditures is available from the <a href="http://www.who.int/health-accounts/ghed/en/"><u>Global Health Expenditure Database</u></a> (GHED)<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9">[8]</a></sup></sup> and the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators"><u>World Development Indicators Database</u></a> (WDI)<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10">[9]</a></sup></sup>. Information on household final consumption expenditure is also extracted from WDI (series code: NE.CON.PRVT.CN).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These benchmarks are also used to decide between two estimates for those
  countries and those years for which both institutions have the same data
  source. For more information please refer to WHO and World Bank 2017 report on
  tracking universal health coverage as well as Wagstaff et al 2018. </p>

  <p>At the end of the quality assurance process, WHO and the World Bank
  assemble non-duplicated estimates of the proportion of the population with
  large household expenditure on health as a share of total household
  expenditure or income for each country. The World Health Organization then
  undertakes a country consultation process. Following a WHO Executive Board
  resolution (EB107.R8) WHO is requested to do this before publishing estimates
  at country level on behalf of member states. For any given indicator, this
  process starts with WHO sending a formal request to ministries of health to
  nominate a focal point for the consultation on the indicator. Once member
  states nominate focal points, WHO then sends draft estimates and
  methodological descriptions to them. STATA codes are available to reproduce
  the estimates shared. The focal points then send to WHO their comments, often
  including new data or revised country estimates that are used to update the
  country estimates. During the 2017 country consultation 137 WHO Member States
  nominated focal points, 100 of these received draft estimates and information
  on the methodology; 37 received only information on methodology as no draft
  estimate was produced. Of the 57 WHO Member States without focal points
  nominated estimates are available for 32 of them.</p>

  <p>In addition to such consultation, the World Health Organization and the
  World Bank regularly undertake training events on the measurement of lack of
  financial protection coverage, which involves participants from the Ministry
  of Health as well as from the National Statistical Office. WHO has several
  regional and national collaborations ongoing to support the production of
  indicator 3.8.2 as it has been recently adopted it is not yet routinely
  produced by National Statistical Office despite the data being available and
  the methodology simple. Results of such collaborations are not yet included in
  the database assembled by WHO and the World Bank but estimates produced by a
  country will be subject to the same quality assurance process just
  described.</p>

  <p>Target 3.8 is defined as &#x201C;Achieve universal health coverage,
  including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care
  services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential
  medicines and vaccines for all&#x201D;. The concern is with all people and
  communities receiving the quality health services they need (including
  medicines and other health products), without financial hardship. Two
  indicators have been chosen to monitor target 3.8 within the SDG framework.
  Indicator 3.8.1 is for health service coverage, which is operationalized with
  an index that combines 16 health service coverage indicators for reproductive,
  maternal and child health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, and
  service capacity and access into a single summary metric. Indicator 3.8.2
  focuses on health expenditures in relation to a household&#x2019;s budget to
  identify financial hardship caused by direct health care payments. Taken
  together, indicators 3.8.1 and 3.8.2 are meant to capture the service coverage
  and financial protection dimensions, respectively, of target 3.8. These two
  indicators should be always monitored jointly.</p>

  <p>Indicator 3.8.2 derives from methodologies dating back to the 1990s
  developed in collaboration with academics at the World Bank and the World
  Health Organization. Indicator 3.8.2 is about identifying people that need to
  devote a substantial share of their total household expenditure or income to
  health care. The focus is on payments made at the point of use to get any type
  of treatment, from any type of provider, for any type of disease or health
  problem, net of any reimbursements to the individual who made the payment but
  excluding pre-payments for health services; for example, in the form of taxes
  or specific insurance premiums or contributions. Such direct payments are the
  least equitable way to finance the health systems given that they determine
  the extent of care received. </p>

  <p>This is clearly against the spirit of the target, which calls for granting
  access based on health needs not a household&#x2019;s capacity to pull
  together all its financial resources to meet the health needs of its members.
  Some direct payments might be needed but indicator 3.8.2 is underpinned by the
  conviction that no one, at whatever income level, should have to choose
  between spending on health and spending on other basic goods and services such
  as education tuitions, food necessities, housing and utilities. One way of
  assessing the extent to which health systems lead to financial hardship is to
  calculate the proportion of the population with large household expenditures
  on health as a share of household total consumption or income. For detailed
  information on the definition chosen to monitor the financial protection
  dimension of universal health coverage within the SDG monitoring framework
  (indicator 3.8.2) please consult Wagstaff et al. (2018) and chapter 2 in the
  WHO and World Bank report on &#x201C;Tracking universal health coverage: 2017
  global monitoring report&#x201D;.</p>

  <p>4.b. Comments and limitations</p>

  <p>It is feasible to monitor indicator 3.8.2 on a regular basis using the same
  household survey data that is used to monitor SDG target 1.1 and 1.2 on
  poverty<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-11"
  id="footnote-ref-11">[10]</a></sup></sup>. These surveys are also regularly
  conducted for other purposes such as calculating weights for the Consumer
  Price Index. These surveys are conducted typically by NSOs. Thus, monitoring
  the proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health
  as a share of total household consumption or income does not add any
  additional data collection burden so long as the health expenditure component
  of the household non-food consumption data can be identified. While this is an
  advantage, indicator 3.8.2 suffers from the same challenges of timeliness,
  frequency, data quality and comparability of surveys than SDG indicator 1.1.1.
  However, indicator 3.8.2 has its own conceptual and empirical limitations.</p>

  <p>First, indicator 3.8.2 attempts to identify financial hardship that
  individuals face when using their income, savings or taking loans to pay for
  health care. However, most household surveys fail to identify the source of
  funding used by a household who is reporting health expenditure. In countries
  where there is no retrospective reimbursement of household spending on health
  this is not a problem. If a household does report any expenditure on health,
  it would be because it is not going to be reimbursed by any third-party payer.
  It is therefore consistent with the definition given for direct health care
  payments (the numerator). </p>

  <p>For those countries on the other hand where there is retrospective
  reimbursement &#x2013; for example, via a contributory health insurance scheme
  - the amount reported by a household on health expenditures might be totally
  or partially reimbursed at some later point, perhaps outside the recall period
  of the household survey. </p>

  <p>Clearly, more work is needed to ensure that survey instruments gather
  information on the sources of funding used by the household to pay for health
  care, or the household survey instrument always specifies that health
  expenditures should be net of any reimbursement. </p>

  <p>Second, in the current definition of indicator 3.8.2 large health
  expenditures can be identified by comparing how much household spend on health
  to either household income or total household expenditure. Expenditure is the
  recommended measure of household&#x2019;s resources (see concept section) but
  recent empirical work has demonstrated that while statistics on 3.8.2 at
  country level are fairly robust to such choice, their disaggregation by income
  group is pretty sensitive to it. Income based measures show a greater
  concentration of the proportion of the population with large household
  expenditure on health among the poor than expenditure based measures (see
  chapter 2 in the WHO and World Bank 2017 report on tracking universal health
  coverage as well as Wagstaff et al 2018) .</p>

  <p>Third, indicator 3.8.2. relies on a single cut-off point to identify what
  constitutes &#x2018;large health expenditure as a share of total household
  expenditure or income&#x2019;. People just below such threshold are not taken
  into account, which is always the problem with measures based on cut-offs.
  This is simply avoided by plotting the cumulative distribution function of the
  health expenditure ratio behind 3.8.2. By doing so, it is possible to identify
  for any threshold the proportion of the population that is devoting any share
  of its household&#x2019;s budget to health. </p>

  <p>Fourth, indicator 3.8.2. is based on measures of ex-post spending on health
  care. Low levels of spending could be driven by measurement errors due to both
  non-sampling errors such as a very short recall period that does not allow the
  collection of information on health care requiring an overnight stay; or
  sampling errors such as over-sample of areas with a particularly low burden of
  disease. No spending could also be due to people not being able to spend
  anything on health which, at least for the services that are included in
  3.8.1, should result in low levels of coverage. </p>

  <p>There are other indicators used to measure financial hardship. WHO uses a
  framework which includes , in addition to indicator 3.8.2, a definition of
  large health expenditure in relation to non-subsistence spending<sup><sup><a

  <p>where <em>i </em>denotes a household,<em> 1()</em> is the indicator
  function that takes on the value 1 if the bracketed expression is true, and 0
  otherwise, <em>m<sub>i</sub></em> corresponds to the number of household
  members of <em>i</em>, corresponds to the sampling weight of household
  <em>i</em>, is a threshold identifying large household expenditure on health
  as a share of total household consumption or income (i.e. 10% and 25%). </p>

  <p>Household health expenditure and household expenditure or income are
  defined as explained in the &#x201C;concept&#x201D; section. For more
  information about the methodology please refer to Wagstaff et al (2018) and
  chapter 2 in the WHO and World Bank 2017 report on tracking universal health
  coverage.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p><strong>Treatment of missing values:</strong></p>

  <p>At the country level no imputation is attempted to produce estimates. The
  proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a
  share of total household expenditure or income is estimated for all years for
  which a nationally representative survey on household budget, household income
  and expenditure, socio-economic conditions or living standards is available
  with information on both total household expenditure or income and total
  household expenditure on health. When there are multiple surveys over time for
  the same country a preference is given to estimates produced based on the same
  survey. A series of tests is performed to retain the best performing series
  (see collection process).</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>To construct regional and global level estimates, when survey-based
  estimates are not available for the reference years of 2000, 2005 or 2010 all
  survey-based estimates within a 5 year window of the reference year are
  &#x201C;lined-up&#x201D; by using a combination of interpolation,
  extrapolation, econometric modelling and imputation based on regional medians
  ( Wagstaff et al.,2018; chapter 2 of the 2017 WHO and World Bank report on
  tracking universal health care coverage).</p>

  <p>The World Bank and the World Health Organization use their own regional
  grouping, in addition to the regional breakdown proposed for the SDG by UNSD.
  </p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p>Data availability:</p>

  <p>This indicator relies primarily on the same data sources that are used to
  monitor SDG indicator 1.1.1 with the additional requirement of the
  availability of information regarding health expenditures. Taking this into
  account, the World Bank and WHO have identified 1566 potentially suitable
  household survey datasets from 155 countries. Some of these surveys were
  excluded because they were either inaccessible, lacked key variables required
  for the estimation of the proportion of the population with large household
  expenditures on health as a share of total household expenditure or income,
  they did not pass the quality assurance process or were not part of a
  consistent time series. As of December 2017 a total of 553 datapoints from 132
  countries or territories spanning the period 1984-2015 have been used to
  produce SDG indicator 3.8.2 . </p>

  <p>Data availability measured in terms of the number of countries that WHO and
  the World Bank have currently reviewed and retained for the estimation of the
  &#x201C;proportion of the population with large household expenditures on
  health as a share of total household expenditure or income&#x201D; is as
  follows for the most recent year:</p>

  <p>Overall data availability covers at least 50% of all WHO member States in
  all M49 regions except for those in Oceania (7.1%). For more information,
  please consult WHO and World Bank 2017 report on tracking universal health ;
  Wagstaff et al 2018.</p>

  <p>Time series:</p>

  <p>The frequency of such data is similar to the frequency of the data used to
  produced SDG indicator 1.1.1. It varies across countries but on average, this
  ranges from an annual 1 year basis to 3 to 5 years.</p>

  <p>Disaggregation:</p>

  <p>The following disaggregation is possible in so far as the survey has been
  designed to provide representative estimates at such level:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Gender and age of the head of the household</li>
    <li>Geographic location (rural/urban)</li>
    <li>Quintiles of the household welfare measures (total household expenditure or income). See comments and limitations for the sensitivity of the disaggregation to the choice of the welfare measure.</li>
  </ul>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>Sources of discrepancies:</p>

  <p>Country level estimates are all based on nationally representative surveys
  with information on both household total expenditure or income and household
  expenditure on health (see data sources). In most cases such data come from
  non-standard household surveys and ex-post standardization processes can be
  designed to increase the degree of comparability across countries. For
  instance, regional teams from the World Bank produce standardized versions of
  raw datasets following common regional procedures: the ECAPOV harmonized
  datasets are based on the Living Standards Measurement Study datasets &#x2013;
  LSMS<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-15" id="footnote-ref-15">[14]</a></sup></sup>
  or household budget surveys (HBS) collected in the World Bank&#x2019;s Europe
  and Central Asia region; the SHIP collection results from a poverty program on
  harmonized household surveys in the World Bank&#x2019;s African region, while
  the SHES collection was developed by the World Bank for the international
  comparison program<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-16"
  id="footnote-ref-16">[15]</a></sup></sup>. The Luxembourg income study (LIS)
  datasets results from effort to harmonize datasets from many high and
  middle-income countries<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-17"
  id="footnote-ref-17">[16]</a></sup></sup>. </p>

  <p>In some cases the raw data is accessible to produce country level
  estimates. In some countries in addition to the raw data a standardized
  version of it is available and in other countries only the standardized
  version is. When multiple versions of the same survey are available the best
  performing in terms of a series of quality assurance tests is retained (see
  collection process). When a standardized version of a nationally designed
  survey instruments is chosen there are differences between expenditure
  variables generated using the raw data, and the expenditure variables
  generated using the harmonization procedures which might result in different
  estimated incidence of the population with large household expenditure on
  health as a share of household total expenditure or income.</p><div
