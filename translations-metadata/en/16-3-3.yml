SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS: >-
  <p>This indicator complements the other indicators of 16.3 which focus on
  rates of pretrial detention and reporting of victimization and thereby
  provides a more holistic picture of people&#x2019;s ability to access justice
  mechanisms across a wide range of disputes. </p>

  <p>This indicator also relates to several other targets under SDG 16 on issues
  that may require access to justice. For instance, people need to access
  justice institutions and mechanisms when they are subject to (or a witness of)
  corruption (target 16.5), when they have problems in accessing government
  payments (such as social safety net assistance) or public services (target
  16.6), when they have difficulty in obtaining legal identify, such as birth
  registration (target 16.9), or when they experience discrimination (target
  16.B). </p>

  <p>In addition, the indicator relates to other Goals that have targets
  conveying aspirations for more just and fair societies. For instance, people
  may need to access justice institutions and mechanisms when faced with
  discrimination in education (target 4.5), when subject to discrimination
  against women and girls (target 5.1), when seeking &#x2018;equal pay for work
  of equal value&#x2019; (target 8.5), when wanting their labor rights to be
  upheld (target 8.8), or when demanding that equal opportunity laws be
  respected (target 10.3).</p>

  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>Number of persons who experienced a dispute during the past two years who
  accessed a formal or informal dispute resolution mechanism, as a percentage of
  all those who experienced a dispute in the past two years, by type of
  mechanism. </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>A <u>dispute</u> can be understood as a <u>justiciable problem</u> between
  individuals or between individual(s) and an entity. Justiciable problems can
  be seen as the ones giving rise to legal issues, whether or not the problems
  are perceived as being &#x201C;legal&#x201D; by those who face them, and
  whether or not any legal action was taken as a result of the
  problem.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2"
  id="footnote-ref-2">[1]</a></sup></sup></p>

  <p>Categories of disputes can vary between countries depending on social,
  economic, political, legal, institutional and cultural factors. There are,
  however, a number of categories that have broad applicability across
  countries, such as problems or disputes related to:<sup><a href="#footnote-3"
  id="footnote-ref-3">[2]</a></sup></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Land or buying and selling property</li>
    <li>Family and relationship break ups</li>
    <li>Injuries or illnesses caused by an intentional or unintentional act or omission of another person or entity</li>
    <li>Occupation/employment</li>
    <li>Commercial transactions (including defective or undelivered goods or services)</li>
    <li>Government and public services (including abuse by public officials)</li>
    <li>Government payments </li>
    <li>Housing (Tenancy and landlord) </li>
    <li>Debt, damage compensation, and other financial matters</li>
    <li>Environmental damage (land or water pollution, waste dumping, etc.)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><u>Dispute resolution mechanisms</u> vary across countries around the
  world. While in many countries courts represent the main institution dealing
  with disputes of civil nature, the same may not be true in countries or
  societies where the first point of reference in such cases are informal
  systems, traditional or religious leaders. The formulation of the indicator,
  and the formulation of the questions in the survey, have to account for these
  differences and make sure to include all relevant institutions or mechanisms
  that are generally recognized and used.</p>

  <p>A list of dispute resolution mechanisms could include: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Lawyer or third-party mediation</li>
    <li>Community or religious leaders or other customary law mechanisms </li>
    <li>A court or tribunal</li>
    <li>The police</li>
    <li>A government office or other formal designated authority or agency</li>
    <li>Other formal complaints or appeal procedure </li>
  </ul>

  <p>To improve the accuracy of the indicator it is important to define
  precisely the denominator (the population at &#x2018;risk&#x2019; of
  experiencing the event of interest, i.e. accessing a dispute-resolution
  mechanism) by identifying the &#x2018;demand&#x2019; of dispute resolution
  mechanisms. This demand is composed of those who use dispute resolution
  mechanisms (users) and those who - despite needing them - do not have
  &#x201C;access&#x201D; to such mechanisms for various reasons such as lack of
  knowledge on how to access them, lack of trust in institutions, lack of legal
  advice/assistance, lack of awareness about justice mechanisms, geographical
  distance or financial costs, to mention a few. It is important to exclude from
  the demand those who experience disputes and do not turn to dispute resolution
  mechanisms because they do not need them (voluntarily self-excluded). This
  refers to cases where the dispute is simple or when respondents solve the
  issue with the other party through direct negotiation.</p><div

SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The Indicator is based on four questions to be included in a household
  survey. The four questions can be part of an add-on access to justice survey
  module, to be incorporated into other ongoing general population surveys (such
  as surveys on crime victimization, corruption, governance, quality of life,
  public attitudes or surveys on other topics) or be part of dedicated surveys
  on access to justice and legal needs.</p>

  <p>Data should be collected as part of a nationally representative probability
  sample of adult population residing in the country, irrespective of legal
  residence status. The sampling frame and sample design should ensure that
  results can be disaggregated at sub-national level. The sample size should be
  sufficiently large to capture relevant events and compute needed
  disaggregations.</p>
COLL_METHOD: |-
  <ul>
    <li>Data are collected through a standardised questionnaire sent to countries. This questionnaire provides specific definitions of data to be collected and it collects a set of metadata to identify possible discrepancies from standard definitions and to assess overall data quality (e.g. sample size, target population, agency responsible for the data collection, etc.). </li>
    <li>Data for multiple years are collected to assess data consistency across time </li>
  </ul>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>Countries are encouraged to conduct surveys on access to justice through
  the proposed module in regular intervals, but at least every four years to
  reflect progress between each of the quadrennial reviews of Goal 16 at the
  High Level Political Forum (HLPF).</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>Data on relevant SDG indicators are collected, compiled and sent back to
  countries for data review annually. Data are then reported to UNSD through the
  regular reporting channels annually.</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>Data are collected through official nationally representative surveys. In
  most countries and most cases, such surveys are conducted by National
  Statistical Offices (NSOs). In some cases, other national institutions or
  other entities may conduct surveys on access to justice according to the same
  methodological standards.</p>

  - </strong>Strengthening the rule of law and promoting human rights are
  cornerstones of UNDP&#x2019;s work to achieve structural transformation for
  sustainable human development, build resilience to prevent and withstand
  shocks and eradicate extreme poverty. UNDP supports national partners to
  expand access to justice, especially for women, youth, persons with
  disabilities, marginalized groups and displaced communities. This includes
  advancing legal aid mechanisms and the use of mobile courts to resolve
  criminal and civil matters in hard-to-reach areas.</p>

  <p>UNODC &#x2013; as custodian of the UN standards and norms in crime
  prevention and criminal justice, UNODC assists Member States in reforming
  their criminal justice systems in order to be effective, fair and humane for
  the entire population. UNODC develops technical tools to assist Member States
  in implementing the UN standards and norms and supports Member States through
  the provision of technical assistance in crime prevention and criminal justice
  reform. It does so through a number of Global programmes and through the UNODC
  field office network.</p>

  <p>OECD &#x2013; The OECD supports its Member and partner countries in
  achieving more responsive and people-centred justice services and access to
  justice as core components of inclusive growth, sound democracies and a
  thriving investment climate. Enhanced access to justice is also a fundamental
  piece of the OECD&#x2019;s work to shape policies that foster equality,
  opportunity and well-being for all, given its significant impacts on
  people&#x2019;s ability to participate in the economy, health, employment and
  relationships. Additional areas of support include digital and data-driven
  transformation of justice, justice for businesses, child-friendly justice,
  justice for women and people-centred measurement of justice performance.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>While there is no standard definition of access to justice, it is broadly
  concerned with &#x201C;the ability of people to defend and enforce their
  rights and obtain just resolution of justiciable problems in compliance with
  human rights standards; if necessary, through impartial formal or informal
  institutions of justice and with appropriate legal
  support.&#x201D;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-4"
  id="footnote-ref-4">[3]</a></sup></sup> For citizens in need of justice, a
  number of conditions should be met for their rights to be recognised, such as
  access to adequate information, access to justice services and legal advice,
  and access to institutions of justice that provide fair and impartial
  treatment. The rationale of this indicator is to focus on one step of the
  process and in particular on the accessibility of justice institutions and
  mechanisms (both formal and informal) by those who have experienced a
  justiciable problem. The indicator can provide important information about the
  overall accessibility of civil justice institutions and processes, barriers,
  and reasons for exclusion of some people. The disaggregation by type of
  dispute resolution mechanism provides additional information about the
  channels used by citizens in need of enforcing or defending their rights. </p>

  <p>This indicator has several advantages: </p>

  <ol>
    <li>It is people-centered, as it measures the experience of justiciable problems from the perspective of those who face them.</li>
    <li>It provides a broad assessment of people&#x2019;s approach to address problems they face, both inside and outside of formal institutions or mechanisms.</li>
    <li>It focuses on the experience of accessing justice mechanisms or institutions when in need</li>
    <li>It is easy to interpret</li>
    <li>It can be produced on the basis of few survey questions, which can be easily incorporated into ongoing national surveys.</li>
    <li>It is well suited to monitor public policies aimed at improving the functioning of formal or informal dispute resolution mechanisms (top-down policies) and to those aimed at empowering the population (bottom-up policies).</li>
    <li>It can be disaggregated by various socio-demographic (such as age, sex, migratory background, etc.) and geographical variables and thus be used to identify vulnerable groups/areas.</li>
    <li>It draws on methodological guidelines derived from a comprehensive review of more than 60 national surveys conducted by governments and civil society organizations in more than 30 jurisdictions in the last 25 years. </li>

REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>A major challenge is that the concept of dispute (justiciable problem) is
  subject to different interpretations and the propensity to consider a
  disagreement or conflict in terms of a justiciable problem can vary greatly
  across individuals and between societies. A way to address this issue is to
  focus on a number of possible disputes that can be considered of justiciable
  nature across most countries, as for example the one listed in the section
  above<sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5">[4]</a></sup>.
  Standardised descriptions of the most common types of disputes are also to be
  used in surveys in order to maximise comparability across different legal
  systems and countries. </p>

  <p>In order to identify the group of people in demand of dispute resolution
  mechanism it is necessary to identify the group of people voluntarily
  self-excluded. A way to identify this group is by including an additional
  question about the reasons why people did not use a dispute resolution
  mechanism. This question would allow to differentiate cases of voluntary and
  involuntary exclusion and define the denominator as the population who
  experienced a problem minus the voluntarily self-excluded.</p>

  <p>Another challenge refers to identifying possible dispute resolution
  mechanisms as they vary considerably in different countries around the world.
  The formulation of the questions in the survey has to take into account these
  different possibilities and make sure to include all relevant institutions
  generally recognized in the community. This proposed list of dispute
  resolution mechanisms identifies those that are common in most countries in
  the world but it can be adapted to the country context.</p>

  <p>The share of population experiencing the disputes under investigation can
  be of relatively small size and this can influence the statistical
  significance of results. A way to address this is to increase the
  survey&#x2019;s reference period, recognizing that respondents&#x2019; ability
  to recall specific issues becomes increasingly unreliable the further back in
  time it extends. For these reasons, this proposal follows the recommendation
  from the Legal Needs Surveys and Access to Justice methodological guidance and
  suggests a reference interval of two years. With such reference period
  resulting data would be suitable for monitoring recent changes in
  contexts/policies while being based on a sufficient number of cases to ensure
  statistical significance of analyses .<sup><a href="#footnote-6"
  id="footnote-ref-6">[5]</a></sup> Possible telescoping effects (the effect of
  misplacement in time of events taking place in the past) need to be addressed
  properly by bounding in clear terms the time interval of reference in relevant
  questions. </p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup class="footnote-number"

  <p>This is a survey-based indicator that emphasizes citizens&#x2019;
  experiences over general perceptions. Both numerator and denominator are
  measured through sample surveys of the general population.</p>

  <p>The computation of this indicator requires the inclusion of a short module
  of four questions in a representative population survey. The following table
  illustrates the content of the four questions needed to compute the
  indicator.</p>

DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>The data for the indicator is collected through Household Surveys conducted
  by National Statistics Offices (NSOs) or other institutions following tight
  survey protocols and complying with the metadata. Data producers are
  encouraged to strictly follow the data quality practices, protocols and
  frameworks in relation of data quality. In addition to the data, countries are
  requested to report on the metadata which serves as one additional layer of
  validation and verification of the data by confronting with the metadata used
  and the recommended for global reporting. Before publication by custodian
  agencies, a standardised &#x201C;pre-publication process&#x201D; is
  implemented, where national stakeholders can verify and review the data before
  publication. </p>

  <p> </p>
ADJUSTMENT: <p>Not applicable.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p>&#x2022; <strong>At country level</strong></p>

  <p>National data are not estimated if data derived from surveys conducted at
  country level are not available</p>

  <p>&#x2022; <strong>At regional and global levels</strong></p>

  <p>There is no imputation of missing values.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Regional aggregates are produced only when available data cover at least a
  certain percentage of countries of the region and the population of these
  countries account for a certain percentage of the regional population.</p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>Methodological documentation from surveys conducted at national level is
  available (e.g. household survey in Nigeria conducted by the National Bureau
  of Statistics (NBS) and UNODC; Governance, Public Safety and Justice Survey
  conducted by Statistics South Africa in 2019, Kenya Integrated Household
  Budget Survey 2015-2016 conducted by KNBS; Argentina - Unmet Legal Needs and
  Access to Justice conducted by the Subsecretar&#xED;a de Acceso a la Justicia
  Ministerio de Justicia y Derechos Humanos; or Colombia - National Quality of
  Life Survey conducted by DANE). </p>

  <p>Furthermore, the Legal Needs Surveys and Access to Justice methodological
  guidance published by OECD in 2019 provides methodological guidance for
  developing the questionnaires and conducting such surveys. This guide brings
  together the experience gained through more than 60 national surveys conducted
  by governments and civil society organizations in more than 30 jurisdictions
  in the last 25 years.</p>
QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>The three custodian agencies have statistical units with dedicated staff to
  support the data collection through technical assistance, collating and
  verifying the received data and continuesly improve data collection mechanisms
  including guidelines.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>It is recommended that NSOs serve as the main contact for compiling and
  quality assuring the necessary data to report on SDG 16.3.3, in close
  coordination with Ministries of Justice and/or other relevant bodies in the
  country. Automated and substantive validation procedures are in place when
  data are processed by custodian agencies to assess their consistency and
  compliance with standards.</p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>The custodians will make available a quality assessment protocol for
  national statistics office to be used at national level and intended to assess
  the alignment of data produced with users needs, the compliance with
  guidelines in terms of computations, the timeliness of data production, the
  accessibility of statistics produced, the consistent use of methodology both
  in terms of geographic representation and through time, the coherence in terms
  of data production, and the architecture of data production. </p>

  <p>A growing number of countries are implementing surveys using similar
  methodologies in order to assess legal needs, improve justice services, and
  strengthen linkages across sectors. However, the scale and methods of
  administration have varied. More than 60 national legal needs surveys have
  been conducted in more than 30 countries over the course of the last 25 years
  (4 by government statistical agencies, 18 by other government bodies, 3 by
  universities, and 37 by other organizations). National legal needs surveys
  have been conducted in Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil (module),
  Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, England and Wales, Georgia, Hong Kong, India,
  Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Macedonia, Mali, Mexico (module),
  Moldova, Mongolia, Nepal, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Northern Ireland,
  Poland, Scotland, Sierra Leone, Slovakia, Taiwan, Tajikistan, Tunisia, Uganda,
  Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates and the United States. In addition,
  extensive sub-national surveys have also been carried out, for example, in
  China, Ecuador, Russia, Indonesia and Yemen, along with smaller surveys in
  countries including Azerbaijan, Rwanda and Egypt.<sup><a href="#footnote-7"
  id="footnote-ref-7">[6]</a></sup> </p>

  <p>In Nigeria, the national statistical offices (NBS) recently conducted two
  successive large-scale surveys (2016 and 2019) &#x2013; with UNODC technical
  support &#x2013; that included a module on access to justice. Statistics South
  Africa has conducted in 2019 a large-scale survey on Governance, Public Safety
  and Justice, which collected the information needed to compute the
  indicator.</p>

  <p>Many of those surveys contain the questions needed to compute this
  indicator (experience of dispute, use of resolution mechanism - either formal
  or informal &#x2013; and reasons for not taking action to resolve the
  dispute).</p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>N/A</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>Recommended disaggregations for this indicator are:</p>

  <p>- type of dispute resolution mechanism</p>

  <p>- sex</p>

  <p>- disability status</p>

  <p>- ethnicity</p>

  <p>- migration background</p>

  <p>- citizenship</p>

  <p>The disaggregation by type of dispute resolution mechanism is of
  fundamental importance to assess the type of justice institutions and
  mechanisms available for citizens and for this reason it is part of the
  indicator itself.</p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup class="footnote-number"

COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>Data for this indicator are based on four standardised survey questions. If
  data from more than one survey are available for the same country,
  discrepancies may be due to different wording of the questions, different
  structure of the questionnaire, different survey methods and operations,
  different sample design and sample size. As a rule, data from national surveys
  complying with recommended standards are used, when available.</p>
