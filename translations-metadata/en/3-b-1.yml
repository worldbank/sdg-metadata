  for the communicable and non&#x2011;communicable diseases that primarily
  affect developing countries, provide access to affordable essential medicines
  and vaccines, in accordance with the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement

  Intellectual Property Rights regarding flexibilities to protect public health,
  and, in particular, provide access to medicines for all</p>

  <p>Target 3.8 Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk
  protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to
  safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for
  all. Indicator 3.8.1: Coverage of essential health services (defined as the

  <p><em>Coverage of DTP containing vaccine (3<sup>rd</sup> dose):</em>
  Percentage of surviving infants who received the 3 doses of diphtheria and
  tetanus toxoid with pertussis containing vaccine in a given year. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Coverage of Measles containing vaccine (2<sup>nd</sup> dose): Percentage of
  children who received two dose of measles containing vaccine according to
  nationally recommended schedule through routine immunization services in a
  given year. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Coverage of Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (last dose in the schedule):
  Percentage of surviving infants who received the nationally recommended doses
  of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in a given year. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Coverage of HPV vaccine (last dose in the schedule):<strong>
  </strong>Percentage of 15 years old girls who received the recommended doses
  of HPV vaccine. Currently performance of the programme in the previous
  calendar year based on target age group is used. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong> </p>

  <p>In accordance with its mandate to provide guidance to Member States on
  health policy matters, WHO provides global vaccine and immunization
  recommendations for diseases that have an international public health impact.
  National programmes adapt the recommendations and develop national
  immunization schedules, based on local disease epidemiology and national
  health priorities. National immunization schedules and number of recommended
  vaccines vary between countries, with only DTP polio and measles containing
  vaccines being used in all countries. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>The target population for given vaccine is defined based on recommended age
  for administration. The primary vaccination series of most vaccines are
  administered in the first two years of life. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><em>Coverage of DTP containing vaccine</em> measure the overall system
  strength to deliver infant vaccination </p>

  <p>Coverage of Measles containing vaccine ability to deliver vaccines beyond
  first year of life through routine immunization services. </p>

COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>Annual data collection through established mechanism. Since 1998, in an
  effort to strengthen collaboration and minimize the reporting burden, WHO and

COMPILING_ORG: <p>WHO and UNICEF</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>This indicator aims to measure access to vaccines, including the newly
  available or underutilized vaccines, at the national level. In the past
  decades all countries added numerous new and underutilised vaccines in their
  national immunization schedule and there are several vaccines under final
  stage of development to be introduced by 2030. For monitoring diseases control
  and impact of vaccines it is important to measure coverage from each vaccine
  in national immunization schedule. A system is already in place to monitor
  immunization coverage for all national programmes, however direct measurement
  for proportion of population covered with all vaccines in the programme is
  only feasible if the country has a well-functioning national electronic
  immunization registry allowing coverage by cohort to be easily estimated.
  While countries will develop and strengthen immunization registries there is a
  need for an alternative measurement.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The rational to select a set of vaccines reflects the ability of
  immunization programmes to deliver vaccines over the life cycle and to adapt
  new vaccines. Coverage for other WHO recommended vaccines are also available
  and can be provided. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Given that HPV vaccine is relatively new and vaccination schedule varies
  from countries to country coverage estimate will be made for girls vaccinated
  by ag 15 and at the moment data is limited to very few countries therefore
  reporting will start later. </p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>WHO and UNICEF jointly developed a methodology to estimate national
  immunization coverage form selected vaccines in 2000, and this approach has
  been refined and reviewed by expert committees over time. The methodology was
  published and reference is available under the reference section. Estimates
  time series for WHO recommended vaccines produced and published annually since
  2001. </p>

  <p>The methodology uses data reported by national authorities from countries
  administrative systems as well as data from immunization or multi indicator
  household surveys. The WHO/UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage
  have been assessed using the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health
  Estimates Reporting (GATHER) checklist. </p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>WHO and UNICEF encourage countries to review and comment on the draft
  coverage estimates shared following the draft production. In past years,
  regional or sub-regional consultations have been held during May/June to go
  through select country data and estimates. </p>
ADJUSTMENT: <p>Not applicable</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <ul>
    <li><strong>At country level </strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The first data point is the first reporting year after vaccine
  introduction. When country data are not available interpolation is used
  between 2 data points and extrapolation from the latest available data point.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>At regional and global levels </strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Any needed imputation is done at country level. These country values are
  then used to compute regional and global estimates. </p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Weighted average of the country-level coverage rates where the weights are
  the country target population sizes based on World Population Prospects: 2022
  revision from the UN Population Division. All Member States from the region
  are included. For HPV 15 year old girls are used for calculation weighted
  average. </p>

  <p>Geographical location, i.e. regional and national and potentially
  subnational estimates </p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>Countries often relay on administrative coverage data, while WHO and UNICEF
  review and assess data from different sources including administrative systems
  and surveys. Differences between country produced and international estimates
  are mainly due to differences between coverage estimates from administrative
  system and survey results. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>In case the vaccine is not included in national immunization schedule the
  coverage from private sector vaccine delivery will not be reflected. </p>
