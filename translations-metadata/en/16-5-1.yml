  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>This indicator is defined as the percentage of persons who paid at least
  one bribe (gave a public official money, a gift or counter favour) to a public
  official, or were asked for a bribe by these public officials, in the last 12
  months, as a percentage of persons who had at least one contact with a public
  official in the same period.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>In the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes
  (ICCS), bribery is defined as: &#x2018;Promising, offering, giving,
  soliciting, or accepting an undue advantage to or from a public official or a
  person who directs or works in a private sector entity, directly or
  indirectly, in order that the person act or refrain from acting in the
  exercise of his or her official duties&#x2019; (ICCS Category 07031). This
  definition is based on definitions of bribery of national public officials,
  bribery of foreign public officials and official of international
  organisations and bribery in the private sector that are contained in the
  United Nations Convention against Corruption (articles 15, 16, and 21).</p>

  <p>While the concept of bribery is broader, as it includes also actions such
  as promising or offering, and it covers both public and private sector, this
  indicator focuses on specific forms of bribery that are more measurable (the
  giving and/or requesting of bribes) and it limits the scope to the public
  sector.</p>

  <p>The concept of undue advantage is operationalized by reference to giving of
  money (in addition to an official fee), gifts or provision of a service
  requested/offered by/to a public official in exchange for a special
  treatment.</p>

  <p>This indicator captures the often called &#x2018;administrative
  bribery&#x2019;, which is often intended as the type of bribery affecting
  citizens in their dealings with public administrations and/or civil
  servants.</p>

  <p>For this indicator, public official refers to persons holding a
  legislative, executive, administrative or judicial office. In the
  operationalization of the indicator, a list of selected officials and civil
  servants is used.</p>

SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>This indicator is derived from household surveys on corruption experience
  and/or victimisation surveys with a module on bribery.</p>

  <p>The indicator refers to individual (&#x201C;direct&#x201D;) experiences of
  the respondent, who is randomly selected among the household members, while
  (&#x201C;indirect&#x201D;) experiences of bribery by other members should not
  be included. However, direct bribery experiences of the respondent can include
  instances where the giving of money (in addition to an official fee), gifts or
  provision of a service is done through someone else (e.g. middlemen).
  Experience of bribery is collected through a series of questions on concrete
  contacts and experiences of bribery with a list of public official and civil
  servants.</p>

  <p>The denominator refers only to those persons that had at least one direct
  interaction with a public official/civil servant as they form the population
  group at risk of experiencing bribery.</p>

  <p>United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) collects data on the
  prevalence of bribery through its annual data collection: the UN Survey of
  Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (UN-CTS). The data
  collection through the UN-CTS is facilitated by a network of over 140 national
  Focal Points appointed by responsible authorities.</p>

  national institutions responsible for data production in the area of crime and
  criminal justice (National Statistical Offices, Ministry of Interior, Ministry
  of Justice, etc.). For countries that have not appointed a focal point, the
  request for data is sent to the permanent mission in Vienna. When a country
  does not report to UNODC, other official sources such as authoritative
  websites, publications, or other forms of communication are used. Once
  consolidated, data are shared with countries to check their accuracy and

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

  <p>At the international level, data are routinely collected and disseminated
  by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) through the annual UN
  Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (UN-CTS)
  data collection. UNODC partners with regional organizations in the collection
  and dissemination of data, respectively with Eurostat in Europe and with the
  Organisation of American States in the Americas. </p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) &#x2013; as custodian
  of the UN standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice, UNODC
  assists Member States in reforming their criminal justice systems in order to
  be effective, fair and humane for the entire population. UNODC develops
  technical tools to assist Member States in implementing the UN standards and
  norms and supports Member States through the provision of technical assistance
  in crime prevention and criminal justice reform. It does so through several
  Global programmes and through the UNODC field office network.</p>

  <p>UNODC is responsible for carrying out the United Nations Survey of Crime
  Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (UN-CTS), which was
  introduced through the General Assembly Resolution <a
  href="https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/3021(XXVII)">A/RES/3021(XXVII)</a> in 1972.
  The Economic and Social Council, in its resolution 1984/48 of 25 May 1984,
  further requested that the Secretary-General maintain and develop the United
  Nations crime-related database by continuing to conduct surveys of crime
  trends and the operations of criminal justice systems. </p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Corruption is an antonym of equal accessibility to public services and of
  correct functioning of the economy; as such, it has a negative impact on fair
  distribution of resources and development opportunities. Besides, corruption
  erodes public trust in authorities and the rule of law; when administrative
  bribery becomes a recurrent experience of large sectors of the population and
  businesses, its negative effects have an enduring negative impact on the rule
  of law, democratic processes and justice. By providing a direct measure of the
  experience of bribery, this indicator provides an objective metric of
  corruption, a yardstick to monitor progress in the fight against
  corruption</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Bribery prevalence in the SDG indicator framework is defined as the
  percentage of persons who paid at least one bribe (gave a public official
  money, a gift or counter favour) to a public official, <u>or were asked for a
  bribe by these public officials</u>, in the last 12 months, as a percentage of
  persons who had at least one contact with a public official in the same
  period.</p>

  <p>In this formulation, the share of the population in contact with public
  officials who was asked to pay a bribe (but did not give it) is to beincluded
  in the numerator of the indicator. However, several historical and on-going
  survey programmes implemented at the national and international level do not
  include experiences of bribery refusal in the formulation and prevalence
  computation. It is expected that data according to the preferred definition
  (which includes bribery refusal) will become increasingly available at
  national and global level, as standardised question wording and indicator
  computation are applied.</p>

  <p>On a more general level, it should be noted that this indicator provides
  information on the experiences of bribery occurring during interactions
  between citizens and the public sector, while it does not cover other forms of
  corruption, such as &#xB4;grand corruption&#xB4;, trading in influence, or
  abuse of power.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The indicator is calculated as the total number of persons who paid at
  least one bribe to a public official (or were asked for a bribe) in the last
  12 months, over the total number of persons who had at least one contact with
  a public official in the same period, multiplied by 100.</p>

DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>Following the submission of the CTS questionnaire, UNODC checks the
  submitted data for consistency and coherence with other data sources. For
  survey-based indicators, metadata are assessed in relation to the
  representativeness and coverage of the survey as well as alignment of question
  wording and answer options with international standards. Member States which
  are also part of the European Union or the European Free Trade Association, or
  candidate or potential candidate to the European Union are sending their
  response to the UN-CTS to Eurostat for validation. The Organization for
  American States is also reviewing the responses of its Member States. All data
  submitted by Member States through other means or taken from other sources are
  added to the dataset after review and validation by Member States.</p>

QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has a statistical
  section with dedicated staff to support the data collection through technical
  assistance, collating and verifying the received data and continuously improve
  data collection mechanisms including guidelines.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>It is recommended that National Statistics Offices (NSOs) serve as the main
  contact for compiling and assuring the quality of the necessary data to report
  on SDG 16.5.1, in close coordination with other relevant bodies in the
  country. Automated and substantive validation procedures are in place when
  data are processed by custodian agencies to assess their consistency and
  compliance with standards.</p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: <p>See section 4.d Validation</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>More than 120 countries have at least one data point on bribery prevalence
  based on a nationally representative survey. A growing number of countries are
  implementing surveys using similar methodologies in order to assess the
  prevalence of bribery experiences in the population. However, the scale and
  methods of administration of the surveys vary. </p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator has recently been included into the annual United Nations
  Crime Trends Survey (UN-CTS, the regular data collection used by UNODC to
  collect data from UN Member States. It is expected that countries will
  gradually report on this indicator as the methodological guidance is
  disseminated and relevant items are included in national surveys.</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>Recommended disaggregation for this indicator are by:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>age and sex of the bribe-givers</li>
    <li>type of official (police officer, health care worker, customs officer, etc.)ethe bribe-givers</li>
    <li>educational attainment of the bribe-givers</li>
  </ul>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>If data from more than one survey are available for the same country,
  discrepancies may arise due to different wording of the questions, different
  structure of the questionnaire, different survey methods and operations,
  different sample design and sample size. As a rule, data from national surveys
  complying with recommended international standards are used, when
  available.</p>
