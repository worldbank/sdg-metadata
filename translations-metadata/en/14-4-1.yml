  <p>Definition:</p>

  <p>The indicator, Proportion of marine fish stocks within biologically
  sustainable levels, measures the sustainability of the world&apos;s marine
  capture fisheries by their abundance. A fish stock whose abundance is at or
  greater than the level that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is
  classified as biologically sustainable. In contrast, when abundance falls
  below the MSY level, the stock is considered biologically unsustainable. </p>

  <p>MSY is defined as the greatest amount of catch that can be harvested
  continuously from a stock under constant and current environmental conditions
  (e.g., habitat, water conditions, species composition and interactions, and
  anything that could affect birth, growth, or death rates of the stock) without
  affecting the long-term productivity of the stock. The indicator measures the
  sustainability of fish resources based a good balance between human use and
  ecological conservation.</p>

  <p>MSY-based reference points are the most common type of reference points
  used in fisheries management today. This is primarily because, for decades,
  reference points from surplus production models have most often been set based
  on the concept of MSY and they are the basic benchmarks for the sustainability
  of fisheries set by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, Article
  61(3)).</p>

  <p>Concepts:</p>

  <p>Fish stock refers to a group of individuals of a single species or
  sometimes combined species living in a defined area from which catches are
  taken in a fishery.</p>

  <p>A reference list of stocks should be established by each country and
  consists of a list of stocks selected according to FAO guidelines, against
  which the indicator will be reported (Appendix 1). The reference list should
  include national and shared stocks but not straddling stocks as defined
  below.</p>

  <p>National stocks are located completely within an EEZ and/or territorial
  waters. </p>

  <p>Shared stocks are distributed within the EEZ and/or territorial waters of
  two or more adjacent countries. </p>

  <p>Straddling stocks are found to move across boundaries between EEZ waters or
  between EEZ and high seas (e.g. tuna stocks), and that are caught by multiple
  countries. </p>

  <p>Countries are asked to report on stocks listed in its reference list,
  including those monitored through official stock assessments by an
  authoritative agency, through a scientific process and using best available
  science and data. These assessments could be based on classic or data-limited
  methods. </p>

  <p>Stock assessment uses biological information, fishery data such as catch
  statistics and fishing effort, and scientific survey data to estimate
  population dynamics of fish stocks for management purposes. Stock assessment
  methods include biological dynamic models, age-structured models, length-based
  methods and stock recruitment models.</p>

SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The MSY-based reference point is often established through a formal stock
  assessment process. The data to inform stock assessments can come from many
  different sources, including fishery-dependent and fishery-independent
  sources. Fishery-dependent data are collected from the fishery itself, using
  both commercial and recreational sources through reporting or sample-based
  surveys at sea, at landing sites, or within fishing communities. Data from
  these sources are generally compiled into fisheries statistics. They can
  include information on removals of fish from the sea, which can include
  landings and discards, and information on the fleet such as number of boats,
  number of tows, time spent on the sea.</p>

  <p>Fisheries-independent are obtained in ways not related to any fishing
  activity and are typically collected by scientists via surveys (often
  scientific cruises) designed to sample species abundance and biomass over long
  time series, and over consistent seasons and geographic areas. Typically,
  fisheries-independent data collect biological information on the species (age,
  length, weight, maturity, etc.), and habitat and environmental information
  (temperature, salinity, depth, etc.).</p>

  <p>Three primary categories of data inputs are required for stock assessment,
  including data on life history traits, and time series of catch and fishing
  effort. Stock abundance is often not known and relative abundance or indices
  are often used to reflect historical changes in population size. These data
  can be sourced from fishery-independent surveys, e.g. acoustic or trawl-based
  sampling, or from fishery-dependent estimates using catch and effort data.
  Life history parameters provides information on individual growth and stock
  productivity e.g. fish size, age, reproductive rates, and natural mortality.
  Catch is the amount of fish removed from a stock by all types of fishing.</p>

  <p>Global/Regional:</p>

  <p>Because of the high data demands of classical stock assessment methods,
  only a limited number of fish stocks have been assessed. These species account
  for 17&#x2013;25 percent of the global catch (Branch et al., 2011), and most
  are caught by fisheries in developed countries. To balance the global
  representativeness of the assessment results and the goal of using the best
  available information, the FAO uses a wide spectrum of data and methods to
  extend its assessment to the fish stocks that account for the majority (70-80
  percent) of the global catch (FAO, 2005).</p>

  <p>National: </p>

  <p>For country reporting, a questionnaire was sent out to all FAO member
  States with marine boundaries (i.e. 165 States) in 2019, and will be resent in
  2021, and then on a two-year basis. For the complete list of questions used to
  inform this indicator, please refer to Appendix 2.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>Global/regional: </p>

  <p>The fish stocks that FAO has monitored since 1974 represent a wide spectrum
  of data availability, ranging from data-rich and formally assessed stocks to
  those that have very little information apart from catch statistics by FAO
  major fishing area and those with no stock assessment at all. For the purposes
  of using the best available data and information and maintaining consistency
  among stocks and assessors, a procedure has been defined to identify stock
  status information (FAO 2011). </p>

  <p>National: </p>

  <p>FAO collects national data through a questionnaire sent to the Principal
  Focal Point (PFP) of each country. The PFP organises an institutional set-up
  which identifies the competent authorities to develop a reference list of
  stocks and completes the questionnaire. The information or data collected
  through the questionnaire from a country will initially only inform individual
  country progress, also acknowledging the need for a learning curve along the
  few first questionnaire inquiries. Depending on the evolution and further
  standardization of country reporting over the next 3-5 years, national data
  may be used to inform global/regional estimates. </p>

INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>Article I of the FAO constitution requires that the organization collect,
  analyses, interpret and disseminate information relating to nutrition, food
  and agriculture (the term &#x201C;agriculture&#x201D; and its derivatives
  includes forestry, fisheries and aquaculture, <a
  href="http://www.fao.org/3/K8024E/K8024E.pdf">http://www.fao.org/3/K8024E/K8024E.pdf</a>)</p>

  <p>The first session of the FAO Conference in 1945 provided the basis and
  rationale for the FAO mandate as a custodian agency of this indicator:
  &#x201C;If FAO is to carry out its work successfully it will need to know
  where and why hunger and malnutrition exist, what forms they take, and how
  widespread they are. Such data will serve as a basis for making plans,
  determining the efficacy of measures used, and measuring progress from time to
  time.&#x201D;</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the
  United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA [UN, 1995]) and the FAO Code of
  Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (FAO, 1995a) all require maintaining or
  restoring fish stocks at levels that are capable of producing their maximum
  sustainable yield (MSY). To fulfil the objectives of these international
  treaties, fishery management authorities need to undertake assessment of the
  state of fish stocks and develop effective policies and management strategies.
  As a UN Agency with a mandate for fisheries, FAO endeavour to provide the
  international community with the best information on the state of marine
  fishery resources.</p>

  <p>Since 1974, FAO has been periodically assessing and reporting the state of
  marine fishery resources using a wide spectrum of methods from numerical
  models to data poor approaches. FAO global and regional estimates were also
  used as an MDG indicator for Goal 7 on environment during the period
  2000-2015. This facilitated its approval as a Tier I SDG indicator by the 2nd
  IAEG-SDG in October 2015.</p>

  <p>The indicator has a peculiar nature compared to more conventional SDG
  indicators. The indicator estimates the sustainability of fish stocks that
  often move across national boundaries. This led the indicator to be initially
  reported only at global and regional levels, with regions not corresponding to
  continental MDG or SDG regions but to marine regions termed &#x201C;FAO Major
  Fishing Areas&#x201D;.</p>

  <p>The Global SDG Indicator Framework is a voluntary mechanism, but countries
  are required to report if data are available. As a custodian agency, the FAO
  works to put in action the 2030 Agenda&#x2019;s emphasis on country ownership
  and higher the incentive to take actions at country, regional and global
  levels. FAO has developed, since 2018, a questionnaire approach to allow
  individual countries to report on the sustainability of fish stocks. The
  approach 1) provides a framework for meaningful country-level reporting that
  complements but does not alter the core methodology of SDG indicator 14.4.1 at
  the global/regional levels (FAO, 2011), and 2) provides countries with
  simplified methods to carry out fish stock assessment in data-limited
  contexts, to some extent overcoming the technical barriers that traditional
  methods presented. This is because country-level reporting will be limited to
  the assessment of stocks that are found only within a country&#x2019;s EEZ
  and/or shared with neighbouring countries&#x2019; EEZs, and therefore not
  include straddling stocks, highly migratory species, or stocks in Areas Beyond
  National Jurisdiction (ABNJ). As a result, national data alone cannot be
  meaningfully aggregated at global/regional levels, but it can be used to
  inform country progress on fish stock sustainability within the EEZ. The FAO
  has developed an online platform to facilitate the estimation and a
  country&#x2019;s own report of the indicator. The platform provides an
  E-learning course that help countries to understand the indicator, estimation
  methodology and report process as well as some simple stock assessment methods
  that can be used to estimate stock status when only limited data are available
  to help address the capacity insufficiency faced by many developing
  countries.</p>

  <p>In 2019, the FAO began sending a questionnaire to countries to collect
  national data with the aim to help countries in the reporting process.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The indicator measures the sustainability of fishery resources, and as an
  end-result is a measure of Target 14.4. Its derivation requires catch data and
  fishing effort and other biological or technical parameters as well together
  with technical expertise necessary to perform stock assessment. The indicator
  at global level is estimated by the FAO based on the methodology developed in
  the 1980s. Although regular updates were carried out to incorporate technical
  advances and changes in major fish species, some discrepancies between regions
  may occur in the representativeness of the reference list in practical
  fisheries. However, this will not pose a large impact on the reliability of
  the indicator&#x2019;s temporal trends.</p>

  <p>For the national level, the composition of stocks within the reference list
  of stocks and the selection criteria used to develop the list will vary
  between countries, making the indicator suitable for checking
  countries&#x2019; own progress over time. However, this reduces the
  comparability of sustainability levels between countries.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>FAO currently reports the global and regional indicators calculated from
  FAO&#x2019;s assessment of a selected list of fish stocks around the world.
  The methodology is described in the FAO Technical Paper (FAO 2011). </p>

  <p> FAO has been developing the new approach for country-level reporting since
  2017, and has consulted with countries in three dedicated expert consultation
  workshops: In November 2017, FAO convened a workshop to exchange views with
  national practitioners on the new proposed analytical methods to produce
  Indicator 14.4.1 at country level<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2"
  id="footnote-ref-2">[1]</a></sup></sup>. In February 2019, FAO convened an
  expert consultation workshop<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3"
  id="footnote-ref-3">[2]</a></sup></sup> on development of the methodologies
  for the global assessment of fish stock status, with participants from
  countries and regional fisheries organizations. In October 2019, FAO organized
  a capacity development workshop on stock status assessment and estimation
  methods of SDG Indicator 14.4.1 for the Asia Pacific Region, with participants
  from 17 countries. However, so far very few countries have started their own
  estimation and reporting of Indicator 14.4.1.</p>

  <p>Global/Regional:</p>

  <p>Global and regional estimates of stock sustainability have been performed
  for 584 fish stocks around the world since 1974, representing 70% of global
  landings. Each stock is estimated using the methodology described in the FAO
  Technical Paper (FAO, 2011). </p>

  <p>National:</p>

  <p>The indicator is calculated as the number of stocks with sustainable status
  divided by the number of stocks with known status in the reference list. This
  proportion is calculated based on stock numbers, without weighting either by
  its production volume or stock abundance; that is, every fish stock is
  considered to have the same importance. </p>

  <p>Countries are requested to report the status of a reference list of fish
  stocks, which should be determined based on the significance of a specific
  stock in a society, either in landings, economic contribution to society, or
  cultural and traditional values, rather than based on whether stock assessment
  exists.</p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup class="footnote-number"

DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>FAO carries out a series of validations to assure that the data and
  information are provided by countries in line with the questionnaire
  instructions. The validation process consists of: (i) identification of
  errors, mistakes and missing value in the data and, (ii) correcting errors,
  mistakes and missing values in close consultation with the countries
  concerned. Each country is asked either to confirm that the data provided are
  correct or to provide remarks and / or revise data accordingly if they
  identify any errors.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: <p>No adjustments were applied for the time series.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p>&#x25CF; At regional and global levels</p>

  <p>To ensure completeness of regional and global information on stocks, FAO
  gathers additional information outside of what is provided by each country, in
  particular concerning the highly migratory and straddling fishing stocks. For
  shared stocks, FAO may consult with Regional Fisheries Bodies (RFBs), who are
  mandated to assess and manage stocks with their contracting parties, in order
  to receive information and data and conduct stock assessment when necessary.
  </p>

  <p>&#x25CF; At country level</p>

  <p>This indicator examines marine fish stocks. If a country has no marine
  capture fisheries, then the indicator is not calculated for that country. In
  such case, no imputation is performed to derive estimates. For countries
  reporting limited marine fish stock data, additional data are compiled from
  scientific working groups and are peer reviewed and analyzed based on FAO
  expert knowledge. However, the estimation of the indicator at regional and
  global levels was estimated not based on country questionnaires, but by the
  FAO through a systematic assessment of a reference list selected globally.
  </p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>As explained in the &#x201C;Rationale&#x201D; section, national data alone
  cannot be meaningfully aggregated at global/regional level because
  country-level reporting will be limited to the assessment of stocks that are
  found only within a country&#x2019;s EEZ (including stocks shared with
  neighbouring countries&#x2019; EEZs), and therefore not include straddling
  stocks, highly migratory species, or stocks in Areas Beyond National
  Jurisdiction (ABNJ). Therefore, regional &#x201C;aggregates&#x201D; by FAO
  Major Fishing Area and the global indicator value are calculated with a
  specific approach, as described in the FAO Technical Paper (FAO 2011)</p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>In each country, the data available for each stock and expertise level to
  conduct different types of assessments will differ. Some countries may have
  classic stock assessments already conducted for many of their stocks, while
  others may have very few or no assessments available. </p>

  <p>For some countries, little stock assessment has been done. To help these
  countries and to facilitate their reporting, FAO prepared online materials and
  tools, including a selection of methods that can be used to evaluate stock
  status with data limited methods such as length-based and catch-only methods.
  The strengths and limitations of these methods are discussed in an eLearning
  course (Lesson 4), and caveats were also provided to avoid misuse and exercise
  cautions in practice. Furthermore, capacity building workshops have been
  organised to provide support to countries in stock assessment and reporting on
  the SDG 14.4.1.</p>

QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>FAO has in place the necessary frameworks and procedures for quality
  assurance of the SDG indicators data, according to the Fundamental Principles
  of Official Statistics and the FAO Statistics Quality Assurance Framework
  (SQAF) available at: <a
  href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3664e/i3664e.pdf">http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3664e/i3664e.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p> . </p>

  <p>FAO is systematically carrying out quality assessments to ensure the
  quality of the SDG indicator data sets. </p>

  <p>For this indicator, a systematic cross-checking of the various source data
  was carried out during the overall compilation process of national and
  regional data.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>The FAO carries out a quality assurance review to help with consistency and
  correctness of this reporting process. The review is performed in two steps to
  quantify the level of confidence that can be attributed to national reporting:
  1) to verify that the questionnaire has been correctly and sufficiently filled
  out and complies with the reporting guidelines, and 2) to assess the
  reliability of the responses relative to the supporting information reported
  by the country. Reliability is based on the compliance to the guidelines in
  developing the reference list of stocks, the proportion of stocks with
  official assessments, the source of stock assessments (e.g. RFB,
  peer-reviewed, expert knowledge), the amount of data available at the stock
  level, and the consistency with regional assessments (for shared stocks). FAO
  provides feedback to respondents, who have an opportunity to adjust their
  submission. </p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>Quality assessment reveals that quality is highly dependent on the primary
  data which undergoes the applicable validation procedures before
  dissemination. The outcomes of the calculations are also controlled and
  compared inside and among FAO fishing areas. Global and regional aggregates
  are assessed by considering and evaluating the contributions of regional
  fisheries bodies while ensuring consistency of the entire time series for the
  global indicator, with reference to the published methodology (FAO, 2011). In
  addition, an internal summary report on the annual assessment of the quality
  of country data is also produced.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p>Data availability:</p>

  <p>The indicator has global data from 1974 to 2017. Regional breakdown is by
  FAO major fishing area. The regional and global indicators were calculated
  based on the reference list of fish stocks FAO established in 1974.</p>

  <p>Global/regional: the indicator has global and regional data from 1974 to
  2017. Regional breakdown is by FAO major fishing area. Countries are not
  directly involved in the computation of the indicator at global/regional
  level. </p>

  <p>National: the national-level questionnaire was dispatched for the first
  time in November 2019; FAO identifies 165 countries with a marine border, and
  three countries with Caspian Sea border, as being eligible, in principle, to
  report. As the result of the first questionnaire call, ninety-seven countries
  expressed interest in the indicator (59%), of which eighty two replied with
  completed questionnaires while three countries reported the indicator
  separately (51.5%), 11 countries stated that they could not report due to lack
  of data or time, and one responded with some catch data. </p>

  <p>Sources of discrepancies:</p>

  <p>The indicator is estimated by the FAO based on the methodology developed in
  the 1980s (FAO, 2011). Although regular updates were carried out to
  incorporate technical advances and changes in major fish species, some
  discrepancies between regions may occur in the representativeness of the
  reference list in practical fisheries. However, this will not pose a large
  impact on the reliability of the Global indicator&#x2019;s temporal trends
  which covers 75% of global landings.</p>

  <p>Appendix 1</p>

  <p>Guidelines to establish reference list of stocks.</p>

  <p>The reference list compiles a list of fish stocks based on data from the
  considered area, i.e. a country&#x2019;s EEZ and/or territorial waters and/or
  possibly the competence area of a regional fisheries management organization.
  This list of fish stocks will ideally include existing Assessment units or
  Management units, and also possibly other unassessed fish stocks that are
  fished in a given country. The list will exclude stocks straddling in the high
  seas, mostly tuna and tuna-like species.</p>

  <p>This list should:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Represent at least 60% (a higher percent is preferred when possible) of the national total landed and/or reported catch (Total in Tonnes excluding landings from straddling stocks). Information should be provided on all of the stocks that contribute to this top 60% (or more) of landings regardless of whether their status is known. Stocks should be input from left to right on the spreadsheet in the order of the largest to smallest total landings for each stock, by Tonnes. Species with multiple different stocks should be input as separate stocks. </li>
    <li>Contain stocks of major importance in terms of catch, ecosystem role, economic value, and social/cultural considerations. If possible, the list should represent stocks of each of these categories for a given country. For example, care should be taken to include fish stocks that are important to small-scale fisheries as well as large-scale industrial fisheries. Consideration for these different categories will vary between countries.</li>
    <li>Remain unchanged (i.e. for at least 5 years) to better reflect changes in stock status at the national level and minimize the effect of changing the reference list of stocks (i.e., adding, deleting, merging stocks) into the SDG indicator. This will ensure consistency in the indicator calculation and better reflect fish stock sustainability over time.</li>
  </ol>
