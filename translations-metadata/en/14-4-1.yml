  <p>The indicator, &quot;Proportion of marine fish stocks within biologically
  sustainable levels&quot;, measures the sustainability of the world&apos;s
  marine capture fisheries by the abundance of the exploited fish stocks with
  respect to MSY levels.</p>

  <p>For each level of reporting (National, Regional, Global) the indicator is
  calculated as the ratio between the number of exploited fish stocks classified
  as &quot;within biologically sustainable levels&quot; and the total number of
  stocks in the Reference List that were classified with a determined status
  (within/not within &quot;biologically sustainable levels&quot;).</p>

  <p>where Ps is the percentage of stocks classified as &quot;within
  biologically sustainable levels&quot; for the Reference List of stocks. Ns is
  the number of stocks in the Reference List classified as &quot;within
  biologically sustainable levels&quot;, Nu is the number of stocks in the
  Reference List classified as &quot;outside biologically sustainable
  levels&quot; and N = Ns + Nu is the total number of stocks in the Reference
  List that have been classified as within or outside &quot;biologically
  sustainable levels&quot;.</p>

  <p>Classifying individual stocks as within/outside &quot;biologically
  sustainable levels&quot;:</p>

  <p>In order to keep consistency with the 14.4 target (&quot;at least to levels
  that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological
  characteristics&quot; and other earlier international agreements, including
  the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), a fish stock is
  classified as &quot;within biologically sustainable levels&quot; if its
  abundance is estimated (considering uncertainty) to be equal to or greater
  than the level that can produce the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). In
  contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY level, the stock is classified as
  &quot;outside biologically sustainable levels&quot;.</p>

  <p>A wide array of methods and approaches (including documented expert
  opinion) is used to classify stock status relative to the abundance producing
  MSY. This varies among countries, regions and stocks. Nevertheless, the
  reliability of the classification is assessed by FAO as part of the process of
  producing the index.</p>

  <p><strong>Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY)</strong> is commonly defined as the
  greatest average amount of catch that can be harvested in the long-term from a
  stock under constant and current environmental conditions (e.g., habitat,
  water conditions, species composition and interactions, and anything that
  could affect birth, growth, or death rates of the stock), without affecting
  the long-term productivity of the stock. A stock can produce MSY if its
  abundance is above a certain level, usually around 50% of its unexploited
  abundance (but actual value can vary around that level, depending on the
  biological characteristics of the stock). See more at <a
  href="https://www.fao.org/faoterm/en/?defaultCollId=21">https://www.fao.org/faoterm/en/?defaultCollId=21</a></p>

  <p>MSY-based reference points are the most common type of reference points
  used in fisheries management today. This is primarily because, for decades,
  reference points from surplus production models have most often been set based
  on the concept of MSY and they are the basic benchmarks for the sustainability
  of fisheries set by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, Article
  61(3)). For more on Reference Points in Fish Stock Assessment, see Caddy and
  Mahon (1995), Cadima (2003) or Haddon (2011).</p>

  <p><strong>BMSY</strong>: Biomass corresponding to Maximum Sustainable Yield
  from a production model or from an age-based analysis using a stock
  recruitment model. Often used as a biological reference point in fisheries
  management, it is the calculated long-term average biomass value expected if
  fishing at FMSY.</p>

  <p><strong>A population is:</strong> &#x201C;A group of individuals of the
  same species living in the same area at the same time and sharing a common
  gene pool, with little or no immigration or emigration.&#x201D;</p>

  <p><strong>A biological stock is: </strong>&#x201C;A subpopulation of a
  species inhabiting a particular geographic area, having similar biological
  characteristics (e.g. growth, reproduction, mortality) and negligible genetic
  mixing with other adjacent subpopulations of the same species.&quot; (FAO,
  2004-2021).</p>

  <p>The <strong>Reference List of Stocks: i</strong>t is not possible to
  classify the sustainability of exploitation for all the exploited stocks from
  a country, region or the world. Therefore, the indicator must be calculated
  based on a subset of these stocks. The list of the stocks that are classified
  for status and used to calculate the indicators is called the &quot;Reference
  List of Stocks&quot;.</p>

  <p>The Reference List of Stocks is built differently for the Regional/Global
  and the National levels. The process of building the Reference List of Stocks
  for regional and global level are described in FAO (2011). At National level,
  countries are requested to define a list of stocks, based on an agreed set of
  criteria (Appendix 1). National and shared stocks can be included, but not
  straddling stocks (stocks that are distributed both in national EEZ and Areas
  Beyond National Jurisdiction).</p>

  <p>At this moment, there is not a direct correspondence between the national
  level Reference Lists (that are defined by each country) and the regional and
  global Reference lists (that are defined by FAO).</p>

SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The classification of the status of exploited stocks relatively to the
  abundance that can produce MSY is often established through a formal stock
  assessment process. The data to inform stock assessments can come from many
  different sources, including fishery-dependent and fishery-independent
  sources. Fishery-dependent data are collected from the fishery itself, using
  both commercial and recreational sources through reporting or sample-based
  surveys at sea, at landing sites, or within fishing communities. They can
  include information on removals of fish from the sea, which can include
  landings and discards, and information on the fleet such as number of boats,
  number of tows, time spent on the sea, as well as economic and social
  information like fish prices, fuel expenditures, total sales, employment or
  other.</p>

  <p>Fishery-independent data are obtained in ways not related to any fishing
  activity and are typically collected by scientists via surveys (often
  scientific cruises) designed to estimate species abundance and biomass over
  long time series, and over consistent seasons and geographic areas. Typically,
  fisheries-independent data also include biological information on the species
  (age, length, weight, maturity, etc.), and habitat and environmental
  information (temperature, salinity, depth, etc.).</p>

  <p>These data and other information are used by Stock Assessment scientists to
  classify the stock status. References on the methods most commonly used can be
  found in Cadima (2003), Haddon (2011), Sparre and Venema (1998) and other
  publications dealing with the methods of stock assessment.</p>

  <p>The information used for the indicator at the Global/Regional level is
  based on a different process and data sources than that used for the national
  level </p>

  <p>Global/Regional:</p>

  <p>Because of the high data demands of classical stock assessment methods,
  only a limited number of fish stocks have been assessed. These species account
  for ca 50 percent of the global catch (Hilborn et al., 2020), and most are
  caught by industrial fisheries in developed countries . To balance the global
  representativeness of the assessment results and the goal of using the best
  available information, the FAO uses a wide spectrum of data and methods to
  extend its assessment to the fish stocks that account for the majority (70-80
  percent) of the global catch (FAO, 2011).</p>

  <p>National:</p>

  <p>The national level indicator, on the other hand, is based exclusively on
  the stock status reported by countries. A multiplicity of methods are used to
  classify the stock status, including model-based estimates, empirical
  indicators and documented expert opinion.</p>

  <p>For country reporting, a questionnaire was sent out to all FAO member
  States with marine boundaries (i.e. 165 States) in 2019, and will be resent in
  2021, and then on a two-year basis. For the complete list of questions used to
  inform this indicator, please refer to Appendix 2.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>At this moment, data collection is separate for the national and
  regional/global levels.</p>

  <p>Global/regional level: </p>

  <p>The fish stocks that FAO has monitored since 1974 represent a wide spectrum
  of data availability, ranging from data-rich and formally assessed stocks to
  those that have very little information apart from catch statistics by FAO
  major fishing area and those with no stock assessment at all. For the purposes
  of using the best available data and information and maintaining consistency
  among stocks and assessors, a procedure has been defined to identify relevant
  stock status information (FAO 2011).</p>

  <p>National level: </p>

  <p>FAO collects national data through a questionnaire sent to the Principal
  Focal Point (PFP) of each country. The PFP organises an institutional set-up
  which identifies the competent authorities to develop a reference list of
  stocks and completes the questionnaire. </p>

  <p>During the initial stages of national data reporting, the information or
  data collected through the questionnaire from a country will initially only
  inform the indicator for the individual countries, also acknowledging the need
  for a learning curve along the few first questionnaire inquiries. As a result,
  the global/regional indicator remains during these initial stages separate
  from the national indicators. However, FAO is working on a convergence (where
  possible) of the two processes, and good-quality stock status assessments
  reported by countries for the national indicators will be included in the
  regional/global indicator calculations, depending on the evolution and further
  standardization of country reporting over the next 3-5 years..</p>

  <p>Despite this effort, due to the heterogeneity of reporting from countries
  in the same FAO Major Fishing Area, and the necessary inclusion of straddling
  and highly migratory stocks and fisheries in the regional and global
  indicator, it is unlikely that a full convergence will be achieved in a short
  time-frame.</p>

  <p>The indicator is applicable for countries with marine borders (or those
  bordering the Caspian Sea) and therefore excludes landlocked countries from
  data collection and processing. </p>

COMPILING_ORG: <p>Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is the
  lead United Nations agency for agriculture, forestry, fisheries and rural
  development. As part of its mandate, it fosters global, regional and national
  sustainable development initiatives to secure responsible fisheries worldwide,
  which in turn requires maintaining fish stocks at biologically sustainable
  levels, so that they can contribute fully, and in a sustainable way, to the
  food and nutrition security, as well as to social and economic development, of
  Humankind.</p>

  <p>Specifically, the mission of the <a
  href="http://www.fao.org/fishery-aquaculture/en/" target="_blank">FAO
  Fisheries and Aquaculture Division (NFI)</a> is stated as &quot;To strengthen
  global governance and the managerial and technical capacities of members and
  to lead consensus-building towards improved conservation and utilization of
  aquatic resources&quot;.</p>

  <p>As part of its mandate, FAO is also tasked with collecting and
  disseminating data and information for improved planning and management of
  fisheries, aquaculture and the other food-producing sectors of the
  economy.</p>

  <p>Article I of the FAO constitution requires that the organization collect,
  analyses, interpret and disseminate information relating to nutrition, food
  and agriculture (the term &#x201C;agriculture&#x201D; and its derivatives
  includes forestry, fisheries and aquaculture, <a
  href="http://www.fao.org/3/K8024E/K8024E.pdf">http://www.fao.org/3/K8024E/K8024E.pdf</a>).</p>

  <p>The first session of the FAO Conference in 1945 provided the basis and
  rationale for the FAO mandate as a custodian agency of this indicator:
  &#x201C;If FAO is to carry out its work successfully it will need to know
  where and why hunger and malnutrition exist, what forms they take, and how
  widespread they are. Such data will serve as a basis for making plans,
  determining the efficacy of measures used, and measuring progress from time to
  time.&#x201D;</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the
  United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA [UN, 1995]) and the FAO Code of
  Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (FAO, 1995a) all require maintaining or
  restoring fish stocks at levels that are capable of producing their maximum
  sustainable yield (MSY). To fulfil the objectives of these international
  treaties, fishery management authorities need to undertake assessment of the
  state of fish stocks and develop effective policies and management strategies.
  As a UN Agency with a mandate for fisheries, FAO endeavours to provide the
  international community with the best information on the state of marine
  fishery resources.</p>

  <p>Since 1974, FAO has been periodically assessing and reporting the state of
  marine fishery resources using a wide spectrum of methods from numerical
  models to data poor approaches. FAO global and regional estimates were also
  used as an MDG indicator for Goal 7 on environment during the period
  2000-2015. This facilitated its approval as a Tier I SDG indicator by the 2nd
  IAEG-SDG in October 2015.</p>

  <p>The indicator has a peculiar nature compared to more conventional SDG
  indicators. The indicator estimates the sustainability of fish stocks that
  often move across national boundaries. This led the indicator to be initially
  reported only at global and regional levels, with regions not corresponding to
  continental MDG or SDG regions but to marine regions termed &#x201C;FAO Major
  Fishing Areas&#x201D;.</p>

  <p>The Global SDG Indicator Framework is a voluntary mechanism, but countries
  are required to report if data are available. As a custodian agency, the FAO
  works to put in action the 2030 Agenda&#x2019;s emphasis on country ownership
  and higher the incentive to take actions at country, regional and global
  levels. FAO has developed, since 2018, a questionnaire approach to allow
  individual countries to report on the sustainability of fish stocks. The
  approach 1) provides a framework for meaningful country-level reporting that
  complements but does not alter the core methodology of SDG indicator 14.4.1 at
  the global/regional levels (FAO, 2011), and 2) provides countries with
  simplified methods to carry out fish stock assessment in data-limited
  contexts, to some extent overcoming the technical barriers that traditional
  methods presented. This is because country-level reporting will be limited to
  the assessment of stocks that are found only within a country&#x2019;s EEZ
  and/or shared with neighbouring countries&#x2019; EEZs, and therefore do not
  include straddling stocks, highly migratory species, or stocks in Areas Beyond
  National Jurisdiction (ABNJ). As a result, national data alone cannot be
  meaningfully aggregated at global/regional levels, but it can be used to
  inform country progress on fish stock sustainability within the EEZ. </p>

  <p>In 2019, the FAO began sending a questionnaire to countries to collect
  national data with the aim to help countries in the reporting process.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The indicator measures the sustainability of fishery resources, and as an
  end-result is a measure of Target 14.4. Its derivation requires catch and
  fishing effort data and/or other biological or technical data and parameters
  as well together with scientific expertise necessary to perform stock
  assessment correctly. The indicator at global level is estimated by the FAO
  based on the methodology developed in the 1980s. Although regular updates were
  carried out to incorporate technical advances and changes in major fish
  species, some discrepancies between regions may occur in the
  representativeness of the reference list in practical fisheries. However, this
  will not pose a large impact on the reliability of the indicator&#x2019;s
  temporal trends.</p>

  <p>For the national level, the composition of stocks within the reference list
  of stocks and the selection criteria used to develop the list will vary
  between countries, making the indicator suitable for checking
  countries&#x2019; own progress over time. </p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>FAO currently reports the global and regional indicators calculated from
  FAO&#x2019;s assessment of a selected list of fish stocks around the world.
  The methodology is described in the FAO Technical Paper (FAO 2011). </p>

  <p>FAO has been developing the new approach for country-level reporting since
  2017, and has consulted with countries in three dedicated expert consultation
  workshops: In November 2017, FAO convened a workshop to exchange views with
  national practitioners on the new proposed analytical methods to produce
  Indicator 14.4.1 at country level<sup><a href="#footnote-1"
  id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup>. In February 2019, FAO convened an expert
  consultation workshop<sup><a href="#footnote-2"
  id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup> on development of the methodologies for the
  global assessment of fish stock status, with participants from countries and
  regional fisheries organizations. In order to help countries reporting on the
  indicator, FAO then organized a series of capacity development workshops on
  stock status assessment and estimation methods of SDG Indicator 14.4.1 for
  various regions. </p>

  <p>In November 2019, FAO dispatched the first SDG14.4.1 questionnaire calling
  countries to report on their national indicator. Eighty-three countries
  submitted their questionnaire and three reported independently. FAO has
  reported the full results of this first inquiry through UNSD in February
  2022.</p>

  <p>For each level of reporting (National, Regional, Global) the indicator is
  calculated as the ratio between the number of exploited fish stocks classified
  as &quot;within biologically sustainable levels&quot; and the total number of
  stocks in the Reference List that were classified with a determined status
  (within/not within &quot;biologically sustainable levels&quot;).</p>

  mistakes and missing values in close consultation with the countries
  concerned. Each country is asked either to confirm that the data provided are
  correct or to provide remarks and / or revise data accordingly if they
  identify any errors.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: <p>No adjustments were applied for the time series.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p><strong>&#x25CF; At regional and global levels</strong></p>

  <p>To ensure completeness of regional and global information on stocks, FAO
  gathers additional information outside of what is provided by each country, in
  particular concerning the highly migratory and straddling fishing stocks. For
  shared stocks, FAO may consult with Regional Fisheries Bodies (RFBs), who are
  mandated to assess and manage stocks with their contracting parties, in order
  to receive information and data and conduct stock assessment when necessary.
  </p>

  <p><strong>&#x25CF; At country level</strong></p>

  <p>This indicator examines marine fish stocks. If a country has no marine
  capture fisheries, then the indicator is not calculated for that country and
  FAO reports it to UNSD with the flag &#x201C;N&#x201D; (Not relevant). When
  data is missing at national level, no imputation is performed to derive
  estimates. The estimation of the indicator at regional and global levels was
  estimated not based on country questionnaires, but by the FAO through a
  systematic assessment of a reference list selected globally. </p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>As explained in the &#x201C;Rationale&#x201D; section, national data alone
  cannot be meaningfully aggregated at global/regional level because
  country-level reporting will be limited to the assessment of stocks that are
  found only within a country&#x2019;s EEZ (including stocks shared with
  neighbouring countries&#x2019; EEZs), and therefore not include straddling
  stocks, highly migratory species, or stocks in Areas Beyond National
  Jurisdiction (ABNJ). Therefore, regional &#x201C;aggregates&#x201D; by FAO
  Major Fishing Area and the global indicator value are calculated with a
  specific approach, as described in the FAO Technical Paper (FAO 2011)</p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>In each country, the data available for each stock and expertise level to
  conduct different types of assessments will differ. Some countries may have
  classic stock assessments already conducted for many of their stocks, while
  others may have very few or no assessments available. </p>

  <p>For some countries, little stock assessment has been done. To help these
  countries and to facilitate their reporting, FAO prepared online materials and
  tools, including a selection of methods that can be used to evaluate stock
  status with data limited methods such as length-based and catch-only methods
  and an online platform for hands-on practice. The strengths and limitations of
  these methods are discussed in an eLearning course (Lesson 4), and caveats
  were also provided to avoid misuse and exercise cautions in practice.
  Furthermore, capacity development workshops have been organised to provide
  support to countries in stock assessment and reporting on the SDG 14.4.1.</p>

QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>FAO has in place the necessary frameworks and procedures for quality
  assurance of the SDG indicators data, according to the Fundamental Principles
  of Official Statistics and the FAO Statistics Quality Assurance Framework
  (SQAF) available at: <a
  href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3664e/i3664e.pdf">http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3664e/i3664e.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>FAO is systematically carrying out quality assessments to ensure the
  quality of the SDG indicator data sets. </p>

  <p>For this indicator, a systematic cross-checking of the various source data
  was carried out during the overall compilation process of national and
  regional data.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>The FAO carries out a quality assurance review to help with consistency and
  correctness of this reporting process. The review is performed in two steps to
  quantify the level of confidence that can be attributed to national reporting:
  1) to verify that the questionnaire has been correctly and sufficiently filled
  out and complies with the reporting guidelines, and 2) to assess the
  reliability of the responses relative to the supporting information reported
  by the country. Reliability is based on the compliance to the guidelines in
  developing the reference list of stocks, the proportion of stocks with
  official assessments, the source of stock assessments (e.g. RFB,
  peer-reviewed, expert knowledge), the amount of data available at the stock
  level, and the consistency with regional assessments (for shared stocks). FAO
  provides feedback to respondents, who have an opportunity to adjust their
  submission. </p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>Quality assessment reveals that quality is highly dependent on the primary
  data which undergoes the applicable validation procedures before
  dissemination. The outcomes of the calculations are also controlled and
  compared inside and among FAO fishing areas. Global and regional aggregates
  are assessed by considering and evaluating the contributions of regional
  fisheries bodies while ensuring consistency of the entire time series for the
  global indicator, with reference to the published methodology (FAO, 2011). In
  addition, an internal summary report on the annual assessment of the quality
  of country data is also produced.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>Global/regional: the indicator has global and regional data from 1974 to
  2019. Regional breakdown is by FAO major fishing area. The regional and global
  indicators were calculated based on the reference list of fish stocks FAO
  established in 1974. Countries are not directly involved in the computation of
  the indicator at global/regional level. </p>

  <p>National: the national-level questionnaire was dispatched for the first
  time in November 2019; FAO identifies 165 countries with a marine border, and
  three countries with Caspian Sea border, as being eligible, in principle, to
  report. As the result of the first questionnaire call, ninety-eight countries
  expressed interest in the indicator (59%), of which eighty-three replied with
  completed questionnaires while three countries reported the indicator
  separately (52%), 11 countries stated that they could not report due to lack
  of data or time, and one responded with some catch data. </p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>Global/regional level: from 1974 to 2017.</p>

  <p>National level: First questionnaire dispatched in November 2019, considered
  a trial/testing phase. Upon comprehensive Quality Assurance analysis, FAO
  reported the full results of this first inquiry through UNSD in February
  2022.</p>

COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator is estimated by the FAO based on the methodology developed in
  the 1980s (FAO, 2011). Although regular updates were carried out to
  incorporate technical advances and changes in major fish species, some
  discrepancies between regions may occur in the representativeness of the
  reference list in practical fisheries. However, this will not pose a large
  impact on the reliability of the Global indicator&#x2019;s temporal trends
  which covers 75% of global landings.</p>

  <p>Appendix 1</p>

  <p>Guidelines to establish reference list of stocks.</p>

  <p>The reference list compiles a list of fish stocks based on data from the
  considered area, i.e. a country&#x2019;s EEZ and/or territorial waters and/or
  possibly the competence area of a regional fisheries management organization.
  This list of fish stocks will ideally include existing Assessment units or
  Management units, and also possibly other unassessed fish stocks that are
  fished in a given country. The list will exclude stocks straddling in the high
  seas, mostly tuna and tuna-like species.</p>

  <p>This list should:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Represent at least 60% (a higher percent is preferred when possible) of the national total landed and/or reported catch (Total in Tonnes excluding landings from straddling stocks). Information should be provided on all of the stocks that contribute to this top 60% (or more) of landings regardless of whether their status is known. Stocks should be input from left to right on the spreadsheet in the order of the largest to smallest total landings for each stock, by Tonnes. Species with multiple different stocks should be input as separate stocks. </li>
    <li>Contain stocks of major importance in terms of catch, ecosystem role, economic value, and social/cultural considerations. If possible, the list should represent stocks of each of these categories for a given country. For example, care should be taken to include fish stocks that are important to small-scale fisheries as well as large-scale industrial fisheries. Consideration for these different categories will vary between countries.</li>
    <li>Remain unchanged (i.e. for at least 5 years) to better reflect changes in stock status at the national level and minimize the effect of changing the reference list of stocks (i.e., adding, deleting, merging stocks) into the SDG indicator. This will ensure consistency in the indicator calculation and better reflect fish stock sustainability over time.</li>
  </ol>
