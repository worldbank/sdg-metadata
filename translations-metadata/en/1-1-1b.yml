  <h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>

  <h2>Definition:</h2>

  <p>The proportion of the employed population below the international poverty
  line of US$1.90 per day, also referred to as the working poverty rate, is
  defined as the share of employed persons living in households with per-capita
  consumption or income that is below the international poverty line of
  US$1.90.</p>

  <h2>Concepts:</h2>

  <p><strong><em>Employment:</em></strong> All persons of working age who,
  during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to
  produce goods or provide services for pay or profit.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Poverty Line:</em></strong> Threshold below which individuals
  in the reference population are considered poor and above which they are
  considered non-poor. The threshold is generally defined as the per-capita
  monetary requirements an individual needs to afford the purchase of a basic
  bundle of goods and services. For the purpose of this indicator, an absolute
  international poverty line of US$1.90 per day is used.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Household in poverty:</em></strong> Households are defined as
  poor if their income or consumption expenditure is below the poverty line
  taking into account the number of household members and composition (e.g.,
  number of adults and children).</p>

  <p><strong><em>Working poor:</em></strong> Employed persons living in
  households that are classified as poor, that is, that have income or
  consumption levels below the poverty line used for measurement.</p>

  <h1>Data sources</h1>

  <h2>Description:</h2>

  <p>The preferred data source is a household survey with variables that can
  reliably identify both the poverty status of households and the economic
  activity of the household&#x2019;s members. Examples include household income
  and expenditure surveys (HIES), living standards measurement surveys (LSMS)
  with employment modules, or labour force surveys (LFS) that collect
  information on household income. Such surveys offer the benefit of allowing
  the employment status and income (or consumption expenditure) variables to be
  derived from the same sampled households ideally for the same observation
  period.</p>

  <p>Employment estimates derived from a household survey other than a labour
  force survey may, however, not be the most robust due to questionnaire design.
  Similarly, a labour force survey may not be the best instrument for collecting
  household income or consumption expenditure data, although an attached income
  module can be designed to achieve statistically reliable results, including
  ensuring an overlap in the observation period between household income (or
  consumption expenditure) and employment status. </p>

  <p>Another possibility is to combine data from a household income and
  expenditure survey and from a separate labour force survey when the respondent
  households can be matched and consistency in the long observation period
  between the surveys can be obtained.</p>

  <h2>Rationale:</h2>

  <p>In order to eradicate poverty, we must understand the root causes of
  poverty. </p>

  <p>The working poverty rate reveals the proportion of the employed population
  living in poverty despite being employed, implying that their
  employment-related incomes are not sufficient to lift them and their families
  out of poverty and ensure decent living conditions. The adequacy of earnings
  is a fundamental aspect of job quality, and these deficits in job quality
  could be keeping workers and their families in poverty.</p>

  <p>The proportion of working poor in total employment (that is, the working
  poverty rate) combines data on household income or consumption with labour
  force framework variables measured at the individual level and sheds light on
  the relationship between employment and household poverty.</p>

  <h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>

  <p>At the country level, comparisons over time may be affected by such factors
  as changes in survey types or data collection methods. The use of PPPs rather
  than market exchange rates ensures that differences in price levels across
  countries are taken into account. However, it cannot be categorically asserted
  that two people in two different countries, living below US$1.90 a day at PPP,
  face the same degree of deprivation or have the same degree of need.</p>

  <p>Poverty in the context of this indicator is a concept that is applied to
  households, and not to individuals, based on the assumption that households
  pool their income. This assumption may not always be true.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the poverty status of a household is a function of the wage and
  other employment-related income secured by those household members in
  employment, income derived from asset ownership, plus any other available
  income such as transfer payments and the number of household members. Whether
  a worker is counted as working poor therefore depends on his or her own
  income, the income of other household members and the number of household
  members who need to be supported. It is thus often valuable to study household
  structure in relation to working poverty. </p>

  <h2>Regional aggregates:</h2>

  <p>The ILO produces global and regional estimates of employment by economic
  class (and thus, of working poverty rates) using the ILO&#x2019;s Employment
  by Class (EbyC) model. These estimates are part of the ILO Estimates and
  Projections series, analysed in the ILO&apos;s World Employment and Social
  Outlook reports. For more information, on the model used to derive these
  estimates, refer to the ILO paper &#x201C;Employment and economic class in the
  developing world&#x201D; (Kapsos and Bourmpoula, 2013), available at <a
