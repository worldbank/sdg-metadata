  <h2>Definition:</h2>

  <p>Mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or
  chronic respiratory disease. Probability of dying between the ages of 30 and
  70 years from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory
  diseases, defined as the per cent of 30-year-old-people who would die before
  their 70th birthday from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic
  respiratory disease, assuming that s/he would experience current mortality
  rates at every age and s/he would not die from any other cause of death (e.g.,
  injuries or HIV/AIDS). This indicator is calculated using life table methods
  (see further details in section 3.3).</p>

  <h2>Concepts:</h2>

  <p>Probability of dying: The likelihood that an individual would die between
  two ages given current mortality rates at each age, calculated using life
  table methods. The probability of death between two ages may be called a
  mortality rate.</p>

  <p>Life table: A table showing the mortality experience of a hypothetical
  group of infants born at the same time and subject throughout their lifetime
  to a set of age-specific mortality rates.</p>

  <p>Cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases:
  ICD-10 underlying causes of death I00-I99, COO-C97, E10-E14 and J30-J98.</p>

  <h1>Data sources</h1>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

  <p>The preferred data source is death registration systems with complete
  coverage and medical certification of cause of death. Other possible data
  sources include household surveys with verbal autopsy, and sample or sentinel
  registration systems.</p>

  <h2>Collection process:</h2>

  <p>WHO conducts a formal country consultation process before releasing its
  cause-of-death estimates.</p>

  <h1>Calendar</h1>

  <h2>Data collection:</h2>

  <p>WHO sends an e-mail two times per year requesting tabulated death
  registration data (including all causes of death) from Member States.
  Countries submit annual cause-of-death statistics to WHO on an ongoing basis.

  <h2>Data release:</h2>
  <p>End of 2016. </p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <h2>Rationale:</h2>

  <p>Disease burden from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among adults is
  rapidly increasing in developing countries due to ageing. Cardiovascular
  diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases are the four main
  causes of NCD burden. Measuring the risk of dying from these four major causes
  is important to assess the extent of burden from premature mortality due NCDs
  in a population.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>

  <p>Cause of death estimates have large uncertainty ranges for some causes and
  some regions. Data gaps and limitations in high-mortality regions reinforce
  the need for caution when interpreting global comparative cause of death
  assessments, as well as the need for increased investment in population health
  measurement systems. The use of verbal autopsy methods in sample registration
  systems, demographic surveillance systems and household surveys provides some
  information on causes of death in populations without well-functioning death
  registration systems, but there remain considerable challenges in the
  validation and interpretation of such data, and in the assessment of
  uncertainty associated with diagnoses of underlying cause of death.</p>

  <h1>Methodology</h1>

  <h2>Computation method:</h2>

  <p>There are 4 steps involved in the calculation of this indicator:</p>

  <p>1. Estimation of WHO life tables, based on the UN World Population
  Prospects 2012 revision. </p>

  <p>2. Estimation of cause-of-death distributions. </p>

  <p>3. Calculation of age-specific mortality rates from the four main NCDs for
  each five-year age range between 30 and 70. </p>

  <p>4. Calculation of the probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70
  years from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory
  diseases.</p>

  <p>The methods used for the analysis of causes of death depend on the type of
  data available from countries:</p>

  <p>For countries with a high-quality vital registration system including
  information on cause of death, the vital registration that member states
  submit to the WHO Mortality Database were used, with adjustments where
  necessary, e.g. for under-reporting of deaths.</p>

  <p>For countries without high-quality death registration data, cause of death
  estimates are calculated using other data, including household surveys with
  verbal autopsy, sample or sentinel registration systems, special studies and
  surveillance systems. In most cases, these data sources are combined in a
  modelling framework.</p>

  <p>The probability of dying between ages 30 and 70 years from the four main
  NCDs was estimated using age-specific death rates of the combined four main
  NCD categories. Using the life table method, the risk of death between the
  exact ages of 30 and 70, from any of the four causes and in the absence of
  other causes of death, was calculated using the equation below. The ICD codes
  used are: Cardiovascular disease: I00-I99, Cancer: C00-C97, Diabetes: E10-E14,
  and Chronic respiratory disease: J30-J98 </p>

  <p>Formulas to (1) calculate age-specific mortality rate for each five-year
  age group between 30 and 70, (2) translate the 5-year death rate into the
  probability of death in each 5-year age range, and (3) calculate the
  probability of death from age 30 to age 70, independent of other causes of
  death, can be found on page 6 of this document:</p>

  <h1>Data availability</h1>

  <p>Around 70 countries currently provide WHO with regular high-quality data on
  mortality by age, sex and causes of death, and another 40 countries submit
  data of lower quality. However, comprehensive cause-of-death estimates are
  calculated systematically by WHO for all of its Member States (with a certain
  population threshold) every 3 years.</p>

  <h2>Disaggregation:</h2>

  <p>Sex</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>

  <p>In countries with high quality vital registration systems, point estimates
  sometimes differ primarily for two reasons: 1) WHO redistributes deaths with
  ill-defined cause of death; and 2) WHO corrects for incomplete death
  registration.</p>
