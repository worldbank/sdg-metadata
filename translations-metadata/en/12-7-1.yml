  <p>The indicator measures the number of countries implementing Sustainable
  Public Procurement (SPP) policies and action plans, by assessing the degree of
  implementation through an index. To produce the index, countries self-assess
  the following main elements: </p>

  <p>- Public procurement legal and regulatory framework</p>

  <p>- Practical support delivered for the implementation of SPP</p>

  <p>- SPP priority products<sup><a href="#footnote-2"
  id="footnote-ref-2">[1]</a></sup> and corresponding sustainable procurement
  criteria </p>

  <p>- Existence of SPP monitoring system</p>

  <p>- Measurement of actual SPP outcome</p>

  Methodology</em></a> (revised February 2021).</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p><em>Sustainable Public Procurement (SPP): </em>Sustainable Public
  Procurement is a &#x201C;A process whereby public organizations meet their
  needs for goods, services, works and utilities in a way that achieves value
  for money on a whole life cycle basis in terms of generating benefits not only
  to the organisation, but also to society and the economy, whilst significantly
  reducing negative impacts on the environment&#x201D; (Definition updated by
  the Multistakeholder Advisory Committee of the 10YFP SPP Programme).</p>

  <p><em>Sustainable Public Procurement Action Plan:</em> A Sustainable Public
  Procurement (SPP) action plan is a policy document articulating the priorities
  and actions a public authority will adopt to support the implementation of
  SPP. </p>

  <p>Plans usually/should address the economic, environmental and social
  dimensions of SPP, and recognise the potential for SPP to realise
  SDGs&#x201D;. In some cases a country&#x2019;s action plan may focus on a
  single aspect of sustainability, being either environmental (e.g.
  &#x201C;Green&#x201D; public procurement action plan), social (e.g. reference
  to human rights, fair trade, focus on employment of minorities, etc.), or
  economic (e.g. promotion of SMEs&#x2019; participation in tenders, focus on
  employment of minorities, etc.). </p>

  <p><em>Best Value for Money:</em> can be defined as the &#x201C;optimum
  combination of whole-life cost and quality to meet the end-user&apos;s
  requirements&quot;.</p>

  <p><em>Life-cycle costing (LCC):</em> is used to evaluate costs which may not
  be reflected in the purchase price of a product, work or service, and which
  will be incurred during their lifetime.</p>

  <p><em>MEAT:</em> The Most Economically Advantageous Tender criterion enables
  the contracting authority to take account of criteria that reflect
  qualitative, technical and sustainable aspects of the tender submission as
  well as price when reaching an award decision.</p>

UNIT_MEASURE: >-
  <p>The unit of measure of SDG 12.7.1. indicator is the number of countries
  implementing SPP policies and action plans.</p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: <p>N/A</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Based on the contact list of focal points identified in the drafting of the
  2017 SPP country factsheets and of the One Planet 10-year framework of
  programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production patterns, representatives
  from more than <strong>70 countries</strong> were contacted from September to
  November 2020<strong>, to identify relevant focal points for SDG 12.7.1 data
  collection.</strong></p>

  <p>As a result of this process, <strong>55+ national governments</strong> and
  <strong>8 subnational governments</strong> (reporting independently from their
  national government) <strong>set a specific team or designated a relevant
  focal point to report on SDG 12.7.1 indicator</strong>, most often originating
  either from National Procurement Agencies, Treasury Boards (Ministries of
  Finance), Ministries of Environment. In rarer cases, from the Focal point
  works for the Statistical Departments in charge of reporting on SDGs at
  national level.</p>

  <p>The SDG 12.7.1 survey was sent out to those focal points and, as a result,
  submissions were received from 40 national/federal governments (some of which
  included subnational data as well from provinces or municipalities). 8
  subnational governments also reported independently on their SPP policy and
  action plan implementation efforts.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>All individual components should be collected at the same source, i.e.,
  focal points nominated to report on SDG 12.7.1. indicator, or SDG focal
  points, every two years, 2021 onwards<sup><a href="#footnote-3"
  id="footnote-ref-3">[2]</a></sup>.</p>

  <p>To facilitate the data collection effort and reporting process, <strong>a
  Microsoft Excel&#xAE;-based calculation tool</strong> was designed <strong>to
  collect inputs</strong>, along with <strong>PDF Reporting
  Instructions</strong>, and <strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong>. This
  Excel&#xAE;-based form provides <strong>a set of answers</strong> for each
  question, which need to be <strong>supported by evidence </strong>(policy
  document, procurement guidelines inclusive of sustainability criteria,
  enabling legislation, trainings, &#x2018;green&#x2019; contracts,
  etc.).</p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup class="footnote-number"
  id="footnote-3">2</sup><p> We consider the 2020 data collection exercise as a
  pilot exercise which will help to refine the metadata and collection method.
  <a href="#footnote-ref-3">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>First data collection: November 2020 &#x2013; February 2021 for 2018-2020
  implementation of sustainable public procurement policies and action plans.
  Following data collection exercises: October-December 2022 and on a biennial
  mode thereafter.</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: '<p>2020 data collection: data to be released in March 2021.</p>'
DATA_SOURCE: <p>SDG 12.7 Focal Points nominated by governments.</p>
COMPILING_ORG: <p>United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>UNEP has been nominated as the custodian of SDG 12 and SDG 12.7.1
  indicator.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Public procurement wields enormous purchasing power, accounting for an
  average of 12 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in OECD countries, and
  up to 30 percent of GDP in many developing countries. Leveraging this
  purchasing power by buying more sustainable goods and services can help drive
  markets in the direction of sustainability, reduce the negative impacts of an
  organization, and also produce positive benefits for the environment and
  society. The advancement of sustainable public procurement (SPP) practices is
  recognized as being a key strategic component of the global efforts towards
  achieving more sustainable consumption and production patterns. SPP
  stakeholders have long requested reliable and up-to-date information on
  activities and organizations involved in SPP.</p>

  <p>As very few countries are able to measure the proportion of their public
  procurement which is green or sustainable, the methodology tries instead to
  assess the means and efforts countries are devoting to the implementation of
  SPP policies or national SPP programmes. Countries scoring above a certain
  threshold will be considered as SPP implementing countries.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The index aims to measure not only SPP but also GPP (Green Public
  Procurement) and SRPP (Socially Responsible Public Procurement). However,
  <strong>SPP, GPP and SRPP may be addressed in very different ways</strong>
  depending on the country. They may appear <strong>as a component of
  overarching policies</strong> such as Sustainable Development Strategies,
  Green Economy Roadmaps, etc. <strong>They may also be addressed directly with
  the adoption of a SPP action plan or policy, or through regulatory
  means</strong>, such as specific provisions in the Public Procurement legal
  framework.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>The main issues faced during the development of this indicator are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Data on the proportion of sustainable public procurement are not available because there is no agreement on which products are green or sustainable and because data are very often not classified in terms of volumes and value of purchased products. </li>
    <li>Another limitation is related to the existence of multiple layers and components of public procurement: central government, provinces in federal countries, municipal level, public enterprises, hospitals, defence, etc. Procurement data from these different sectors are very often not aggregated.</li>
    <li>In addition, contracts below a certain threshold are not monitored.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As a result, and in line with the comment in the rationale section, it was
  decided to focus on process sub-indicators which will measure the means and
  efforts countries are investing in the implementation of their SPP plans,
  policies and programmes.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>So as to evaluate the &#x2018;<em>number of countries implementing a
  sustainable public procurement policy and action plans</em>&#x2019;,
  <strong>a</strong> <strong>specific threshold</strong> <strong>above which a
  country will be</strong> <strong>considered as having a sound SPP policy or
  action plan </strong>has been set, to determine whether this country will be
  considered compliant with the indicator in the final calculation of SDG
  Indicator 12.7.1.</p>

  <p>It is proposed that this assessment is <strong>based on the evaluation of a
  national government&#x2019;s SPP implementation level, scope and
  comprehensiveness</strong>, through the <strong>appraisal of 6 specific
  parameters</strong> (described in the table below), which will lead to the
  calculation of a <strong><em>Government SPP Implementation Score.

  <p>It is proposed that the <strong>specific threshold</strong> above which a
  country is considered as having a sound SPP policy or action plan and
  considered compliant with SDG 12.7.1. indicator <strong>is set at a score
  equal to 1.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Five classification groups</strong> are proposed to classify
  submissions received, and reflect the <strong>different stages in the
  advancement of SPP implementation:</strong></p>

  <p><strong>SPP Implementation Classification Groups</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Level 0: Insufficient data or insufficient implementation of SPP
  policy/ action plan</strong> (SPP Implementation Score below 1), therefore not
  complying with the expected set level of implementation.</p>

  <p><strong>------------------------------------------ <em>Threshold</em>
  --------------------------------------------------------</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Level 1: </strong>Low level of SPP implementation<strong>
  </strong>(SPP Implementation Score ranging from 1 to 2).</p>

  <p><strong>Level 2: </strong>Medium-low level of SPP implementation<strong>
  </strong>(SPP Implementation Score ranging from 2 to 3).</p>

  <p><strong>Level 3: </strong>Medium-high level of SPP implementation<strong>
  </strong>(SPP Implementation Score ranging from 3 to 4).</p>

  <p><strong>Level 4: </strong>High level of SPP implementation<strong>
  </strong>(SPP Implementation Score larger than 4).</p>

  <p>The full calculations and explanation of the index can be found in the
  attached <a
  href="https://wedocs.unep.org/handle/20.500.11822/37332"><strong><em>SPP Index
  methodology</em></strong></a>.</p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>Firstly, <strong>Excel-based self-assessment forms</strong>, along with
  <strong>PDF Guidance, and Frequently Asked Questions</strong> are shared with
  reporting government focal points to provide relevant instructions on how to
  supply the required information and data. For each answer provided, it is
  required to provide relevant evidence, and precise references to that
  evidence, supporting the selected pre-set answer.</p>

  <p>Secondly, each report is verified to check whether relevant evidence is
  provided.</p>

  <p>Detailed feedback specific to each question is sent to the relevant focal
  points to request for clarifications or further details and evidence.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, further to those bilateral exchanges, the additional information
  or evidence provided are further checked. <strong>When it appears that the
  provided details/evidence do not sufficiently support the selected answer,
  those answers are not considered in the final evaluation</strong>. Final
  information and reports provided are deemed compliant or not compliant,
  leading to the calculation and validation of the final SPP score.</p>

  <p>The calculation of this final score provides a basis for the classification
  of governments into five different categories reflecting the level of
  implementation of SPP, as described in section <em>4.c. Method of
  computation</em>.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>Despite the fact that the evaluation methodology was developed in
  consultation with national governments and SPP experts from different areas of
  the world, as the differences in public procurement systems and framework
  significantly differ, some governments had difficulties in applying some
  questions in section B to their own practice of SPP implementation (for
  example, GPP implementation through the use of ecolabels in Asian countries,
  rather than through (a strong) regulatory framework as in the European Union).
  As regards section B, equivalent systems of implementation were therefore
  accepted after deliberation.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p>&#x2022; <strong>At country level</strong></p>

  <p>With regard to the developed SPP government implementation assessment
  itself, missing values do not significantly impact the calculated score, as
  governments may report on some sub-indicators only (B, C, D, E, F), only
  sub-indicator A being mandatory (A: Existence of a SPP action plan/policy,
  and/or SPP regulatory requirements).</p>

  <p>With regard to the general assessment of SPP implementation at country
  level<strong>, it should however be noted that it had been</strong>
  <strong>originally planned to calculate a country-level SPP implementation
  Index based on the aggregation of three sub-indices reflecting three different
  levels of government</strong>, including <strong>a weighting representing the
  government&#x2019;s share of procurement </strong>in total public procurement
  value at country level (formula shown below), which would provide a fairer
  evaluation of SPP efforts at country level.</p>

  <p>The actual scope of the national/federal government&#x2019;s SPP
  implementation might indeed vary considerably from one country to another, as
  in some countries, SPP implementation when directed by the central government
  may apply to most public entities in the country, while in other countries,
  implementation conducted by the federal government might only represent a
  small share of public procurement at country level.</p>

  <p>The first data collection exercise however <strong>showed that the total
  public procurement value</strong>, at country level or at the level of the
  considered government, <strong>is not always available</strong>, therefore not
  allowing for the calculation of such an index.</p>

  <p>In the first reporting exercise, the assessed level of SPP implementation
  and further classification in groups, is therefore mainly based on the
  calculated SPP National/Federal Government Score, taking account of
  national/federal government SPP implementation efforts. </p>

  <p>Subnational submissions received may however also be evaluated following
  the same evaluation framework, and, through the calculation of a similar
  score, be classified according to their level of SPP implementation, and
  compared with similar-level governments (higher-level subnational government
  &#x2013; such as provinces, or states in the case of Brazil and the US
  &#x2013; and lower-level subnational government &#x2013; such as cities and
  municipalities).</p>

  <p>&#x2022; <strong>At regional and global levels:</strong></p>

  <p>As SDG 12.7.1. indicator measures the number of countries implementing SPP
  action plans and policies, therefore missing data (countries not submitting
  reports on their implementation of SPP) do not significantly impact the
  indicator measurement.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>The data will be aggregated at the sub-regional, regional and global
  levels. For the aggregation methods, please see: <a
  href="http://wesr.unep.org/media/docs/graphs/aggregation_methods.pdf">http://wesr.unep.org/media/docs/graphs/aggregation_methods.pdf</a>.
  </p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>To facilitate 2020 data collection exercise and ensure the widest possible
  participation, the following documents were made available to focal points and
  developed <u>in three languages</u> (English, Spanish and French):</p>

  <ul>
    <li>2020 Excel-based calculation tool used for the collection of inputs;</li>
    <li>2020 Reporting Instructions;</li>
    <li>2020 Frequently Asked Questions.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Four explanatory webinars were also held in October 2020 in these three
  languages (two webinars in English, one in French, one in Spanish) to
  introduce the Calculation methodology and reporting tools, and provide the
  necessary guidance on how to provide the required data. Those webinars were
  attended by a total of 79 government representatives from 43 countries.</p>

  <p>Public procurement systems differing significantly, and the responsibility
  of SPP/GPP/SRPP policy development or implementation belonging to different
  ministries or institutions in each country, it is not however in UNEP&#x2019;s
  capacity to provide more detailed assistance to national focal points on data
  collection specific to each sub-indicator, as those data may originate either
  from Public Procurement Agencies, Treasury Boards (Ministry of Finance), or
  Ministries of Environment.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>Data will be made available for all member states which have sustainable
  public procurement policies and action plans, as defined by the indicator.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>The reporting on this indicator will be biennial, starting from 2021.</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>Administrative level of the public procurement: national, provincial, or
  local. </p>

  <p>Note: Information has been received at those three levels in the first data
  collection exercise, but only in rare occasions. Data can be provided
  <u>separately</u> by administrative level (whenever data was received from
  subnational governments) for some provincial or local governments only.</p>
