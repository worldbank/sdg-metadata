  <h2><strong><strong>Description:</strong></strong></h2>

  <p>In accordance with the World Bank&#x2019;s Operational Policy 14.10 (which
  includes IBRD and IDA General Conditions) external debt reporting is required
  to fulfil the World Bank&#x2019;s needs for reliable and timely external debt
  information to (a) assess a borrowing country&apos;s foreign debt situation,
  creditworthiness, and economic management; and (b) conduct its country
  economic work and assess regional and global indebtedness and debt servicing
  problems. </p>

  <p>External borrowing of reporting countries is performed through the Debtor
  Reporting System (DRS), which was established in 1951 and captures detailed
  information at loan level by using standardized set of forms.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <h2><strong><strong>Collection process:</strong></strong></h2>

  <p>Public and publicly guaranteed debt is reported on a quarterly basis
  through form 1 and form 2. Specifically, the new loan commitments are reported
  on Form 1 and when appropriate, Form 1a (Schedule of Drawings and Principal
  and Interest Payments); the loan transactions are reported once a year on Form
  2 (Current Status and Transactions). Form 3 is used to report corrections to
  data originally reported in Forms 1 and 2. Forms 1 and 1A are submitted
  quarterly, within 30 days of the close of the quarter. Form 2 is submitted
  annually, by March 31 of the year following that for which the report is
  made.</p>

DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <h1>Data providers</h1>

  <p>The agency in charge of producing the debt statistics at the national level
  is the World Bank with the data sourced by government agencies on a loan by
  loan basis. The national data provider of &#x201C;Exports of Goods, and
  Services&#x201D; is the institution in charge of the collection and
  compilation of the Balance of Payments statistics. This responsibility varies
  and is country specific (i.e. Central Bank). World Bank staff estimates for
  &#x201C;Exports of Goods and Services&#x201D; data are used for gap filling
  purposes. &#x201C;Exports of Goods and Services&#x201D; data are not reported
  directly to the World Bank from the national data provider. They are reported
  to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is the institution in charge
  of overseeing balance of payment stability as part of its institutional
  mandate.</p>

  <h1>Methodology</h1>

  <h2><strong><strong>Computation method:</strong></strong></h2>

  <p>Public and publicly guaranteed external debt data are compiled by the World
  Bank based on the World Bank <em>Debtor Reporting System Manual</em>, dated
  January 2000 which sets out the reporting procedures to be used by countries.
  The data are provided by the countries on a loan by loan basis. </p>

  <p>&#x201C;Exports of goods and services&#x201D; data are sourced from
  IMF&#x2019;s Balance of Payments Statistics database and then gap-filled with
  World Bank staff estimates in accordance with the sixth edition of the
  <em>Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual</em>
  (<em>BPM6</em>) </p>

  <p>Both components are used to express the indicator in percentage terms.</p>
