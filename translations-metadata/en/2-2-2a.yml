  <p>Good nutrition lays the foundation for achieving many of the SDGs with
  improvements in nutrition directly supporting the achievement of SDG3
  (ensuring healthy lives), while also playing a role in ending poverty (SDG1),
  ensuring quality education (SDG4), achieving gender equality (SDG5), promoting
  economic growth (SDG8), and reducing inequalities (SDG10). In this way,
  nutrition is the lifeblood of sustainable development, and drives the changes
  needed for a more sustainable and prosperous future. The child overweight
  target in particular is strongly linked to SDG target 3.4, which aims to
  reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by one third by
  2030.</p>

  <p>The UNICEF/WHO/World Bank Joint Malnutrition Estimates (JME) working group
  generates modelled estimates for 205 countries and territories utilizing
  primary data sources (e.g., household surveys).</p>

  <p><u>The global SDG Indicators Database only contains modelled estimates</u>.
  Primary data sources can be found at
  data.unicef.org/nutrition/malnutrition.html,

  <a
  href="http://datatopics.worldbank.org/child-malnutrition">http://datatopics.worldbank.org/child-malnutrition</a>.</p>

  <p>The official SDG indicator is overweight as assessed using
  weight-for-height. Overweight can however also be assessed with other
  indicators such body mass index (BMI)-for-age. In general BMI-for-age is not
  used in the joint database of primary sources (e.g., household surveys) but
  has been considered in absence of any other available estimates. </p>

  <p>The WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS) (<a
  href="https://www.who.int/tools/child-growth-standards/who-multicentre-growth-reference-study">WHO
  2006</a>) was undertaken to generate a growth standard for assessing the
  growth and development of infants and young children around the world. The
  MGRS collected primary growth data and related information from children from
  widely different ethnic backgrounds and cultural settings (Brazil, Ghana,
  India, Norway, Oman, and the USA). The resulting growth standard can be
  applied to all children everywhere, regardless of ethnicity, socioeconomic
  status and type of feeding. The indicator refers to those moderately or
  severely overweight, that is with a z-score above 2 standard deviations from
  the median weight-for-length/height of the growth standard. </p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>For the majority of countries, nationally representative household surveys
  constitute the primary data source used to generate the JME modelled
  estimates. For a limited number of countries data from surveillance systems
  are also used as a primary data source for generation of the JME modelled
  estimates if sufficient population coverage is documented (about 80%). For
  both types of primary data sources, the child&#x2019;s length/height and
  weight measurements have to be collected following recommended standard
  measuring techniques (<a
  href="https://data.unicef.org/resources/data-collection-analysis-reporting-on-anthropometric-indicators-in-children-under-5/">WHO/UNICEF
  2019</a>). </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank group jointly review new data sources to
  update the country level estimates. Each agency uses their existing mechanisms
  for obtaining data.</p>

  <p>For UNICEF, the cadre of dedicated data and monitoring specialists working
  at national, regional and international levels in 190 countries routinely
  provide technical support for the collection and analysis of nutrition data.
  UNICEF also relies on a data source catalogue that is regularly updated using
  data sources from catalogues of other international organizations and national
  statistics offices. This data collection is done in close collaboration with
  UNICEF regional offices with the purpose of ensuring that UNICEF global
  databases contain updated and internationally comparable data. The regional
  office staff work with country offices and local counterparts to ensure all
  relevant data are shared.</p>

  <p>WHO data gathering strongly relies on the organization&#x2019;s structure
  and network established over the past 30 years, since the creation of its
  global database, the WHO Global Database on Child Growth and Malnutrition, in
  the late 1980&#x2019;s (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15542535/">de
  Onis et al. 2004</a>).</p>

  <p>The World Bank Group provides estimates available through the Living
  Standard Measurement Surveys (LSMS) which usually requires re-analysis of
  datasets given that the LSMS reports often do not tabulate the child
  malnutrition data. </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>Data collection is carried out by the three-agency group throughout the
  year.</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>The UNICEF-WHO-WB Joint Child Malnutrition (JME) group releases country,
  regional and worldwide estimates at the end of March every other year so that
  data are available for the SDG report and database. The JME group also
  maintain a database of primary data sources (e.g., household surveys)), which
  is updated every six months, and used to generate the JME modelled
  estimates.</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>The majority of the data sources used are nationally representative
  household surveys (e.g., Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple
  Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) and National Nutrition Surveys (NNS)). Some
  data come from other sources (e.g., administrative, sentinel systems, etc).
  Data providers vary and most commonly are ministries of health, national
  offices of statistics or national institutes of nutrition.</p>
COMPILING_ORG: '<p>UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank group</p>'
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>UNICEF is responsible for global monitoring and reporting on the wellbeing
  of children. UNICEF actively supports countries in data collection and
  analysis for reporting on child malnutrition indicators primarily through
  high-quality MICS surveys, as well as providing technical and financial
  support to other surveys. UNICEF not only supports household surveys but also
  works with global partners to define technical standards for the collection
  and analysis of anthropometric data. UNICEF also compiles statistics on child
  nutrition with the goal of making internationally comparable estimates and
  databases publicly available. In-depth analyses of the data on child
  malnutrition, which are included in relevant data-driven publications,
  including in its flagship publication, <em>The State of the World&#x2019;s
  Children,</em> and the <em>Child Nutrition Report</em> are also conducted by
  UNICEF.</p>

  <p>WHO has an established role in the monitoring of child growth and
  malnutrition since the late 1980&#x2019;s and had the mandate to develop the
  WHO Child Growth Standards, launched in 2006, and adopted by more than 160
  countries. WHO has published several per-reviewed articles with regional and
  global estimates until 2012, when they joined forces with UNICEF and the World
  Bank, with the objective of harmonizing child malnutrition estimates. WHO has
  the mandate to monitor and report progress on the six global nutrition
  targets, endorsed in 2012 by the World Health Assembly, amongst them, three on
  child malnutrition, namely stunting, overweight and wasting (SDG 2.2.1, 2.2.2
  (1) and 2.2.2 (2)). </p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Child growth is an internationally accepted outcome area reflecting child
  nutritional status. Child overweight refers to a child who is too heavy for
  his or her height. This form of malnutrition results from expending too few
  calories for the amount of food consumed and increases the risk of
  noncommunicable diseases later in life. Child overweight is one of the World
  Health Assembly nutrition target indicators.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Survey estimates come have uncertainty due to both sampling error and
  non-sampling error (e.g., measurement technical error, recording error etc.,).
  The JME modelled estimates for overweight take into account estimates of
  sampling error around survey estimates. While non-sampling error cannot be
  accounted for or reviewed in full, when available, a data quality review of
  weight, height and age data from household surveys supports compilation of a
  time series that is comparable across countries and over time.</p>

  <p>Of particular concern for overweight is the fact that data for high-income
  countries are scarce yet the prevalence is generally higher among the
  high-income countries with data. The JME group are working closely with
  countries in the European region to increase coverage, as well as to apply age
  adjustments for data covering only partially the age interval 0 to 59 months.
  </p>

  <p>The JME working group carefully utilizes all available national data
  sources, and documents all the steps taken to infer about country trends based
  on the national data sources. The estimation method (McClain et al 2018) is
  based on and closely aligned to country data. The approach smooths and fits a
  trend line across the national data points. The basis of the estimates are
  nationally representative household surveys. However, as surveys are conducted
  infrequently (e.g., less frequently than every 3 years) in some countries,
  models produce a complete time series with estimates available in the same
  years for all countries. This allows for comparable assessment of progress;
  for example, all countries can be assessed using the same baseline year. For
  any individual country, an increase in the availability of primary data points
  can result in more robust and accurate modelled estimates.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>National estimates from primary sources (e.g., from household surveys) used
  to generate the JME modelled estimates are based on standardized methodology
  using the WHO Child Growth Standards as described in <em>Recommendations for
  data collection, analysis and reporting on anthropometric indicators in
  children under 5 years old</em> (<a
  href="https://data.unicef.org/resources/data-collection-analysis-reporting-on-anthropometric-indicators-in-children-under-5/">WHO/UNICEF
  2019</a>) and WHO Anthro Survey Analyser (<a
  href="https://www.who.int/tools/child-growth-standards/software">WHO,
  2019</a>). The JME country modelled estimates are generated using smoothing
  techniques and covariates (<a
  href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30430613/">McLain et al. 2018</a>)
  applied to quality-assured national data to derive trends and up-to-date
  estimates. Worldwide and regional estimates are derived as the respective
  country averages weighted by the countries&#x2019; under-five population
  estimates (UNPD-WPP latest available edition) using annual JME country
  modelled estimates. </p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank undertake a joint review for each potential
  primary data source used as to generate the JME modelled estimates. The group
  conducts a review when (at minimum) a final report with full methodological
  details and results are available, as well as (ideally) a data quality
  assessment flagging potential limitations. When the raw data are available,
  they are analysed using the Anthro Survey Analyzer software to produce a
  standard set of results and data quality outputs against which the review is
  conducted. Comments are documented in a standard review template extracting
  methodological details (e.g., sampling procedures, description of
  anthropometrical equipment), data quality outputs (e.g., weight and height
  distributions, percentage of cases that were flagged as implausible according
  to the WHO Child Growth Standards) and the malnutrition prevalence estimates
  from the data source under review generated based on the standard recommended
  methodology. These estimates are compared against the reported values, as well
  as against those from other data sources already included in the JME database,
  to assess the plausibility of the trend before including the new point.
  Reports that are preliminary, or that lack key details on methodology or
  results, cannot be reviewed and are left pending until full information is
  available. </p>

  <p>The methods used to generate the JME country modelled estimates for
  stunting and overweight were cross validated to ensure estimates produced by
  the method are closely aligned to national data points. The methodology used
  to model these estimates was reviewed through a technical consultation with
  experts and country representatives of National Statistics Offices as well as
  IAEG-SDGs Members in 2019 (UNICEF/WHO/World Bank, 2019). Country consultation
  with SDG 2.2 focal points are also held every two years before finalizing and
  disseminating each edition of the JME global, regional and country estimates.
  The purpose of the country consultations is to ensure the estimates include
  all recent and relevant primary data sources and to engage with and receive
  feedback from national governments on the estimates. </p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>Adjustments to reported values are made in cases where raw data are not
  available for re-analysis and it is known from the report that the estimates
  were derived based on indicators that do not adhere to the standard definition
  used for monitoring of the SDGs (e.g., they are based on different growth
  references, etc.). The three types of adjustments that have been applied to
  the JME country database include adjustments to standardize for: (i) area of
  residence, specifically for data sources that were only nationally
  representative at the rural level; (ii) growth reference, specifically for
  data sources that used the 1977 NCHS/WHO Growth Reference instead of the 2006
  WHO Growth Standards to generate the child malnutrition estimates; and (iii)
  age, specifically for data sources that did not include the full
  0&#x2013;59-month age group (e.g., data sources reporting on
  2&#x2013;4-year-olds). These three types of adjustments are described further
  in this section. </p>

  <p><strong>i. Adjustment from national rural to national </strong></p>

  <p>A number of surveys cover only rural areas, and, while they have been
  sampled to be nationally representative for the rural parts of the country,
  they did not sample any urban areas. Given that malnutrition prevalence
  generally varies between urban and rural areas (i.e., stunting prevalence was
  reported to be two times higher in rural areas compared to urban areas at the
  global level (5)), a rural-only survey would not be comparable with a national
  survey that are representative of both urban and rural areas. To improve
  comparability of the rural-only data sources for the specific country, it is
  necessary to account for urban populations in estimates from these surveys.
  </p>

  <p>The adjustment method used by the JME group is to apply the relative
  proportions of malnutrition prevalence for each urban and rural area from the
  closest survey in the country&#x2019;s JME database includes disaggregated
  estimates by area of residence, to the survey that covers only rural areas.
  This is done under the assumption that the urban:rural population ratio
  remains the same as the survey with the disaggregations available (e.g., the
  proportion of children living in rural areas in the country is the same in the
  survey year used for the adjustment as in the survey year being adjusted) and
  also that relative prevalence of malnutrition across urban-rural areas in the
  survey with the missing data is the same as in the survey with full
  information used for the adjustment. </p>

  <p><strong>ii. Adjustment to use the 2006 WHO Growth Standard (converted
  estimates)</strong></p>

  <p>The indicators of stunting, wasting and overweight used to track SDG Target
  2.2 require a standard deviation (SD) score (z-score) to be calculated for
  each child who is measured for a data source; and the z-score requires a
  growth reference against which it can be calculated. Prior to the release of
  the WHO Child Growth Standards in 2006, the 1977 NCHS/WHO reference was
  recommended for international comparisons. The WHO Growth Standard results in
  estimates of stunting and wasting prevalence that are higher as well as
  estimates of overweight that are lower than estimates generated using the
  NCHS/WHO growth reference (6). It was therefore necessary to account for these
  differences and standardize estimates across data sources. As such, data
  sources published prior to the release of the new growth standard in 2006 had
  to be re-analysed using the 2006 growth standards to obtain comparable
  estimates across time and location. When raw data were not available, a
  standard algorithm was applied to convert estimates from surveys based on the
  NCHS reference to estimates based on the WHO Growth Standards (7). </p>

  <p><strong>iii. Age-adjustment </strong></p>

  <p>A limited number of surveys in the JME country database of primary sources
  that do not have microdata report on age groups that do not cover the entire
  0&#x2013;59-month age range in the standard definition for stunting, wasting
  and overweight. Adjustment for age is needed as malnutrition prevalence can
  vary by sub-age group. For example, stunting prevalence among
  24&#x2013;59-month olds in recent surveys with age-disaggregations were more
  than two times higher than the stunting prevalence among 0&#x2013;5-month olds
  (8). Surveys that omit part of the full age range might thus not be comparable
  with a survey that did cover all 0&#x2013;59-month olds. Age adjustment can
  thus help to properly assess the country trend. Similar to the adjustment for
  rural-only surveys, the proportion of children with malnutrition in the two
  sub-age groups is assumed to be the same in the survey years in question.</p>

QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>The JME working group, which was formed in 2011 with representatives from
  UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank, is responsible for management of the processes
  used to develop regular updates of the JME estimates. This includes the
  regular update of the country database of surveys used to generate the JME
  country modelled estimates, for which regular communication with regional and
  country teams allows the JME working group to secure microdata for re-analysis
  according to the standard method. The JME working group also continuously
  review methods and considers and tests different methodologies to improve the
  estimates as necessary. Additionally, a Technical Expert Advisory Group on
  Nutrition Monitoring (TEAM), jointly established by UNICEF and WHO, provides
  advice on nutrition monitoring methods and processes, including on the
  JME.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>The quality criteria established in the 2019 UNICEF/WHO guidance (<a
  href="https://data.unicef.org/resources/data-collection-analysis-reporting-on-anthropometric-indicators-in-children-under-5/">WHO/UNICEF,
  2019</a>) were used to update the JME primary data source review form . The
  JME review form is used to abstract key information including methodological
  details (e.g., sampling procedures, description of anthropometrical
  equipment), data quality outputs (e.g., response rates, weight and height
  distributions, percentage of cases that were flagged as having implausible
  anthropometry outcomes according to the WHO Child Growth Standards) and the
  malnutrition prevalence estimates from each primary data source (e.g.,
  household survey) under review. One JME working group member fills in the
  review form for each data source and when information is missing or further
  details are required, the country teams are contacted. Once all information is
  available and the JME primary data source review form is completed, each data
  source is reviewed by the three agencies (UNICEF, WHO, WB) which form the JME
  working group. This allows for a thorough and efficient standard joint review
  of each data source by the three agencies prior to inclusion in the JME
  country database of primary sources (e.g., household surveys) that are used to
  generate the JME country modelled estimates. </p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>Data consistency and quality checks described above are conducted for each
  potential primary data source (e.g., household survey) before inclusion in the
  JME country database of primary sources that are used to generate the JME
  modelled estimates. Cross-validation exercises are performed for the modelled
  estimates to ensure the method generates estimates that are aligned to
  national data points. Country consultations with SDG 2.2 focal points an held
  every other year also provide opportunity to ensure the estimates include all
  recent and relevant country data. </p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>The JME modelled country estimates from 2000 to 2022 for overweight were
  released for 161 countries that had at least one primary data source (e.g.,
  from household survey) included in the 2023 JME country database.</p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>At country level, JME country modelled estimates from 2000 to the year
  before the JME release ) are presented for countries with at least one data
  point (e.g., from survey/surveillance included in the joint database of
  primary data sources. Survey years range from 1983 to the year before the JME
  release. Worldwide and regional annual estimates are available from 2000 to
  the year before the JME release. </p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>Country, regional and worldwide JME estimates refer to the age group of
  children under 5 years, sexes combined. Disaggregations are currently not
  available for the JME modelled estimates. However, a disaggregated dataset of
  national primary sources with sub national and stratified estimates (e.g.,
  sex, age groups, wealth, mothers&apos; education, residence) is available.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>For the survey estimates included in the JME joint database of primary
  sources, re-analysis based on standardized methodology using the WHO Child
  Growth Standards as described in Recommendations for data collection, analysis
  and reporting on anthropometric indicators in children under 5 years old (<a
  href="https://data.unicef.org/resources/data-collection-analysis-reporting-on-anthropometric-indicators-in-children-under-5/">WHO/UNICEF
  2019</a>) and WHO Anthro Survey Analyser (<a
  href="https://www.who.int/tools/child-growth-standards/software">WHO,
  2019</a>) is applied whenever microdata are available to enhance comparability
  across the time series. Country teams are encouraged to use the WHO Anthro
  Survey Analyser (<a
  href="https://www.who.int/tools/child-growth-standards/software">WHO,
  2019</a>) to undertake survey analysis and harmonize with the global standard
  analysis methods. </p>

  <p>For the inclusion of survey estimates into the JME database, the
  inter-agency group applies a set of survey quality assessment criteria. When
  there is insufficient documentation, the survey is not included until
  information becomes available. Discrepancies between results from standard
  methodology and those reported may occur for various reasons, for example, the
  use of different standards for z-score calculations, imputation of the day of
  birth when missing, the use of rounded age in months, the use of different
  flagging systems for data exclusion. For surveys based on the previous
  NCHS/WHO references, and for which raw data are not available, a method for
  converting the z-scores to be based on the WHO Child Growth Standards is
  applied (<a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2431/8/19">Yang and de
  Onis, 2008</a>). In addition, when surveys do not cover the age interval 0-59
  months, or are only representative of the rural areas, an adjustment based on
  other surveys for the same country, is performed. Any adjustment or conversion
  is transparently stated in the annotated joint data set.</p>

  <p>The JME country modelled estimates, which are based on smoothing techniques
  and covariates, as described elsewhere (<a
  href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30430613/">McLain et al. 2018</a>), vary
  from estimates from primary data sources such as household surveys, but in
  most cases the 95 per cent confidence bounds of the country modelled estimates
  for a given country in a given year fall within the 95 per cent confidence
  bounds of the estimate from the primary source for the corresponding country
  and year(s).</p>
