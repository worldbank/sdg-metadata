  <h2>Definition:</h2>

  <p>This information only refers to 17.19.2 (b): Proportion of countries that
  have achieved 100 per cent birth registration and 80 per cent death
  registration</p>

  <p>According to the Principles and Recommendations for a Vital Statistics
  System, Revision 3 (<a
  href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/standmeth/principles/M19Rev3en.pdf">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/standmeth/principles/M19Rev3en.pdf</a>),
  a complete civil registration is defined as: &#x201C;The registration in the
  civil registration system of every vital event that has occurred to the
  members of the population of a particular country (or area), within a
  specified period as a result of which every such event has a vital
  registration record and the system has attained 100 per cent
  coverage.&#x201D;</p>

  <p>In a given country or area, the level of completeness of birth registration
  can be different from the level of completeness of death registration. </p>

  <p>There exist several methods for the evaluation of completeness of birth or
  death registration systems. An elaboration of these methods is available at
  Principles and Recommendations for a Vital Statistics System, Revision 3. The
  evaluation and monitoring of quality and completeness of birth and death
  registration systems are addressed in Part three, sub-Chapters: D. Quality
  assessment methods; E. Direct versus indirect assessment, and F. Choosing
  appropriate methods for assessing completeness and qualitative accuracy of
  registration and register-based vital statistics (para 579 to 622).</p>

  <p>Indicator 17.19.2(b) has two parts; the first concerning the birth
  registration and the second concerning the death registration of each
  individual country or area. </p>

  <h1>Data sources</h1>

  <h2>Collection process:</h2>

  <p>The national level of completeness of birth and death registration is
  provided by the National Statistical Offices of all countries and areas to the
  United Nations Statistics Division as part of the annual data collection for
  the United Nations <em>Demographic Yearbook</em>. This information is usually
  reported as part of the metadata worksheets of the Vital Statistics
  questionnaire. The template of this questionnaire is available at: <a

RATIONALE: >-
  <h2>Rationale:</h2>

  <p>The introduction of indicator 17.19.2 (b) as part of the SDG global
  framework reflects the recognition of the fundamental role of the civil
  registration system to the functioning of societies, and the legal and
  protective advantages that it offers to individuals. The essential purpose of
  civil registration system is to furnish legal documents of direct interest to
  individuals. Aside from the direct and overarching importance of civil
  registration to the public authorities, in that the information compiled using
  the registration method provides essential data for national and regional
  preparation and planning for medical and health-care programmes, the role
  played by civil registration in proving, establishing, implementing and
  realizing many of the human rights embodied in international declarations and
  conventions reflects one of its most important contributions to the normal
  functioning of societies.</p>

  <h1>Methodology</h1>

  <h2>Computation method:</h2>

  <p>The two sub-indicators of the indicator 17.19.2(b) are expressed as
  proportions: at the global level, the proportion of countries that have
  achieved 100 per cent birth registration is measured as the number of
  countries that have achieved 100 per cent birth registration to the total
  number of countries. The computation is done in an analogous manner for the
  death registration part as well as for the regional measurements of both birth
  and death registration sub-indicators. </p>

  <p>The latest compiled data for this indicator are part of the Statistical
  Annex to the 2017 SG&#x2019;s progress report, available at <a
  href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/report/2017/secretary-general-sdg-report-2017--Statistical-Annex.pdf%20">https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/report/2017/secretary-general-sdg-report-2017--Statistical-Annex.pdf</a>
  (please refer to the last two pages). These data are compiled using the
  country-reported information on availability and completeness of birth and
  death registration data at the country level, to the United Nations
  <em>Demographic Yearbook</em>, via the <em>Demographic Yearbook </em>Vital
  Statistics questionnaire and accompanying metadata. United Nations
  <em>Demographic Yearbook </em>collection and associated online compilations
  are published by the United Nations Statistics Division of the Department of
  Economic and Social Affairs. Please refer to: <a
  href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/default.htm">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/default.htm</a>
  </p>

  <p>At the present time, the thresholds used for compiling the data for the
  indicator 17.19.2(b) are 90 per cent for birth registration and 75 per cent
  for death registration, due to the classification that has been used in the
  <em>Demographic Yearbook</em> metadata questionnaire on vital statistics. This
  classification has currently been modified to enable reporting according to
  the exact formulation of the indicator 17.19.2(b).</p>

  total number of countries or areas in the respective region.</p>

  <p>17.19.2 (b.2) Number and proportion of countries with death registration
  data that are at least 75 per cent complete: The number of countries or areas

  <h2>Disaggregation:</h2>

  <p>By their definition, the sub-indicators of the indicator 17.19.2(b) refer
  to the national levels of completeness of birth and death registration. </p>

  <p>However, knowledge of the birth and death registration completeness at
  sub-national administrative areas, as well as by income, sex, age group,
  disability status, etc. is very important for monitoring and improving the
  functioning of birth and death registration systems.</p>
