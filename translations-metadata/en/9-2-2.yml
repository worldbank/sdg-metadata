  <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>

  <p>This indicator presents the share of manufacturing employment in total
  employment.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>Employment comprises all persons of working age who during a short
  reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or
  provide services for pay or profit. </p>

  <p>The working-age population is usually defined as all persons aged 15 and
  above. </p>

  <p>For further clarification, see: Resolution concerning statistics of work,
  employment and labour underutilization (2013), available from <a
  href="http://ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm">http://ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm</a>.
  </p>

  <p>No distinction is made between persons employed full time and those working
  less than full time.</p>

  <p>The manufacturing sector is defined according to the International Standard
  Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC) revision 4 (2008,
  the latest) or revision 3 (1990). It refers to industries belonging to sector
  C in revision 4 or sector D in revision 3.</p>

SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The preferred official national data source for this indicator is a
  household-based labour force survey. </p>

  <p>In the absence of a labour force survey, a population census and/or other
  type of household survey with an appropriate employment module may also be
  used to obtain the required data. </p>

  <p>Where no household survey exists, establishment surveys or some types of
  administrative records may be used to derive the required data, keeping into
  account the limitations of these sources in their coverage. Specifically,
  these sources may exclude some types of establishments, establishments of
  certain sizes, some economic activities or some geographical areas.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The ILO Department of Statistics processes national household survey
  microdatasets in line with internationally-agreed indicator concepts and
  definitions set forth by the International Conference of Labour Statisticians.
  For data that could not be obtained through this processing or directly from
  government websites, the ILO sends out an annual ILOSTAT questionnaire to all
  relevant agencies within each country (national statistical office, labour
  ministry, etc.) requesting the latest annual data and any revisions on
  numerous labour market topics and indicators, including many SDG
  indicators.</p>

  <p>UNIDO employment data are collected using General Industrial Statistics
  Questionnaire which is filled by NSOs and submitted to UNIDO annually. </p>
FREQ_COLL: <p>Continuous</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: <p>Continuous</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>Mainly national statistical offices, and in some cases labour ministries or
  other related agencies, at the country-level. In some cases, regional or
  international statistical offices can also act as data providers.</p>
COMPILING_ORG: >-
  <p>United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and
  International Labour Organization (ILO)</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The ILO is the UN focal point for labour statistics. It sets international
  standards for labour statistics through the International Conference of Labour
  Statisticians. It also compiles and produces labour statistics with the goal
  of disseminating internationally-comparable datasets, and provides technical
  assistance and training to ILO member States to support their efforts to
  produce high quality labour market data.</p>

  <p>UNIDO, as the specialized UN agency on industrial development, has the
  international mandate for collecting, producing and disseminating
  internationally comparable industrial statistics. UNIDO&#x2019;s mandate
  covers (i) the maintenance and updating of international industrial statistics
  databases; (ii) methodological and analytical products based on statistical
  research and experience of maintaining internationally comparable statistics;
  (iii) contributions to the development and implementation of international
  statistical standards and methodology; and (iv) technical cooperation services
  to countries in the field of industrial statistics. With the repositioning of
  UNIDO as the focal agency for inclusive and sustainable industrial development
  (ISID), its statistical mandate was expanded to cover all dimensions of
  industrial development, including its inclusiveness and environmental
  sustainability.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>This indicator conveys the contribution of manufacturing in total
  employment. It measures the ability of the manufacturing sector to absorb
  surplus labour from agricultural and other traditional sectors. However, in
  developed countries an opposite trend is expected where emphasis has shifted
  to reduction in labor in manufacturing as part of cost-cutting measures, to
  promote more capital-intensive industries. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The characteristics of the data source impact the international
  comparability of the data, especially in cases where the coverage of the
  source is less than comprehensive (either in terms of country territory or
  economic activities). In the absence of a labour force survey (the preferred
  source of data for this indicator), some countries may use an establishment
  survey to derive this indicator, but these usually have a minimum
  establishement size cut-off point and small units which are not officially
  registered (whether in manufacturing or not) would thus not be included in the
  survey. Consequently, employment data may be underestimated. Discrepancies can
  also be caused by differences in the definition of employment or the
  working&#x2013;age population. </p>

DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>The ILO engages in annual consultations with member States through the
  ILOSTAT questionnaire and related Statistics Reporting System (StaRS).
  National data providers receive a link to the portal where they can review all
  national SDG data available on ILOSTAT.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>Through the ILO Harmonized Microdata initiative, the ILO strives to produce
  internationally comparable labour statistics based on the indicator concepts
  and definitions adopted by the International Conference of Labour
  Statisticians.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p><strong>&#x2022;</strong> <strong>At country level</strong></p>

  <p>Multivariate regression and cross-validation techniques are used to impute
  missing values at the country level. The additional variables used for the
  imputation include a range of indicators, including labour market and economic
  data. However, the imputed missing country values are only used to calculate
  the global and regional estimates; they are not used for international
  reporting on the SDG indicators by the ILO. For further information on the
  estimates, please refer to the ILO modelled estimates methodological overview,
  available at
  https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/ilo-modelled-estimates/.</p>

  <p><strong>&#x2022;</strong> <strong>At regional and global
  levels</strong></p>

  <p>The aggregates are derived from the ILO modelled estimates that are used to
  produce global and regional estimates of, amongst others, employment by
  economic activity. These models use multivariate regression and
  cross-validation techniques to impute missing values at the country level,
  which are then aggregated to produce regional and global estimates. The
  regional and global shares of employment in manufacturing are obtained by
  first adding up, across countries, the numerator and denominator of the
  formula that defines the manufacturing employment as a proportion of total
  employment - outlined above. Once both magnitudes are produced at the desired
  level of aggregation, the ratio between the two is used to compute the share
  for each regional grouping and the global level. Notice that this direct
  aggregation method can be used due to the imputation of missing observations.
  For further information on the estimates, please refer to the ILO modelled
  estimates methodological overview, available at
  https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/ilo-modelled-estimates/.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>The global and regional aggregates are calculated after direct summation of
  country values within country groups.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>Data consistency and quality checks are regularly conducted for validation
  of the data before dissemination in the ILOSTAT database. </p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>Data is available in ILOSTAT for 177 countries and territories.</p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>Data for this indicator is available from 2000 in the UN Global SDG
  Database, but longer time series are available in ILOSTAT.</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>This indicator can be disaggregated by sex, occupation, age, region and
  others.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>The difference may arise due to: a) discrepancies in data sources; b) ISIC
  Revision used by a country; c) informal employment; d) coverage of data source
  (geographical coverage, economic activities covered, types of establishments
  covered, etc.); e) working-age population definition..</p>
