  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in
  international organizations has two components, the developing country
  proportion of voting rights and the developing country proportion of
  membership in international organisations. In some institutions these two
  components are identical.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator is calculated independently for eleven different
  international institutions: The United Nations General Assembly, the United
  Nations Security Council, the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the
  International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and
  Development, the International Finance Corporation, the African Development
  Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the
  World Trade Organisation, and the Financial Stability Board.</p>

  <p>There is no established convention for the designation of
  &quot;developed&quot; and &quot;developing&quot; countries or areas in the
  United Nations system. In common practice, Japan in Asia, Canada and the
  United States in northern America, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania, and
  Europe are considered &quot;developed&quot; regions or areas. The aggregation
  across all institutions is currently done according to the United Nations M.49
  statistical standard which includes designation of &#x201C;developed
  regions&#x201D; and &#x201C;developing regions&#x201D;, while an ongoing
  review seeks to reach agreement on how to define these terms for the purposes
  of SDG monitoring. The designations &quot;developed&quot; and developing&quot;
  are intended for statistical convenience and do not necessarily express a
  judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the
  development process.</p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

  <p>The data is compiled and the proportions calculated by the Financing for
  Development Office, United Nations Department of Economic and Social
  Affairs.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The United Nations is based on a principle of sovereign equality of all its
  Member States (Article 2, UN Charter). This indicator aims to measure the
  degree to which States enjoy equal representation in different international
  organizations.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Cross institutional comparisons needs to pay attention to the different
  membership of the institutions. Voting rights and membership in their
  institutions are agreed by the Member States themselves. As a structural
  indicator, there will be only small changes over time to reflect agreement on
  new States joining as Members, suspension of voting rights, membership
  withdrawal and negotiated voting rights changes.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The computation uses each institutions&#x2019; own published membership and
  voting rights data from their respective annual reports. The proportion of
  voting rights is computed as the number of voting rights allocated to
  developing countries, divided by the total number of voting rights. The
  proportion of membership is calculated by taking the number of developing
  country members, divided by the total number of members.</p>
