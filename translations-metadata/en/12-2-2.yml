  <h2>Definition:</h2>

  <p>Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a standard material flow accounting
  (MFA) indicator and reports the apparent consumption of materials in a
  national economy. </p>

  <h2>Concepts:</h2>

  <p>Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) and MF need to be looked at in
  combination as they cover the two aspects of the economy, production and
  consumption. The DMC reports the actual amount of material in an economy, MF
  the virtual amount required across the whole supply chain to service final
  demand. A country can, for instance have a very high DMC because it has a
  large primary production sector for export or a very low DMC because it has
  outsourced most of the material intensive industrial process to other
  countries. The material footprint corrects for both phenomena. </p>

  <h1>Data sources</h1>

  <h2>Description:</h2>

  <p>The global material flows database is based on country material flow
  accounts from the European Union and Japan and estimated data for the rest of
  the world. Estimated data is produced on the bases of data available from
  different national or international datasets in the domain of agriculture,
  forestry, fisheries, mining and energy statistics. International statistical
  sources for DMC and MF include the IEA, USGS, FAO and COMTRADE databases. </p>

  <h2>Rationale:</h2>

  <p>DMC reports the amount of materials that are used in a national economy.
  DMC is a territorial (production side) indicator. DMC also presents the amount
  of material that needs to be handled within an economy, which is either added
  to material stocks of buildings and transport infrastructure or used to fuel
  the economy as material throughput. DMC describes the physical dimension of
  economic processes and interactions. It can also be interpreted as long-term
  waste equivalent. Per-capita DMC describes the average level of material use
  in an economy &#x2013; an environmental pressure indicator &#x2013; and is
  also referred to as metabolic profile. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>

  <p>DMC cannot be disaggregated to economic sectors which limits its potential
  to become a satellite account to the System of National Accounts (SNA). </p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <h1>Methodology</h1>

  <h2>Computation method:</h2>

  <p>It is calculated as direct imports (IM) of material plus domestic
  extraction (DE) of materials minus direct exports (EX) of materials measured
  in metric tonnes. DMC measure the amount of materials that are used in
  economic processes. It does not include materials that are mobilized the
  process of domestic extraction but do not enter the economic process. DMC is
  based on official economic statistics and it requires some modelling to adapt
  the source data to the methodological requirements of the MFA. The accounting
  standard and accounting methods are set out in the EUROSTAT guidebooks for MFA
  accounts in the latest edition of 2013. MFA accounting is also part of the
  central framework of the System of integrated Environmental-Economic Accounts
  (SEEA). </p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>At country level:</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>A zero is imputed when no positive real value was officially recorded, in
  the base data sets used, for any of the underlying components which make up
  this aggregated total. Thus &#x201C;0.0&#x201D; can represent either NA, or a
  genuine 0.0, or (crucially) a combination of both, which is a common
  situation. This allows for values to be easily aggregated into further
  aggregations; however, it should be thus noted that due to imputing missing
  values as &#x2018;0.0&#x2019;, the aggregations may represent a lower value
  than actual situation. </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>At regional and global levels:</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Similarly, missing values are imputed as zero in the regional and global
  aggregations. However, in the case where no data is available at all for a
  particular country then the per capita and per GDP estimates are weighted
  averages of the available data. </p>

  <h1>Data availability</h1>

  <h2>Description:</h2>

  <p>The data covers more than 170 countries. </p>

  <h2>Time series:</h2>

  <p>The data set covers each nation individually, over a time period of 47
  years (1970-2017).</p>

  <h2>Disaggregation:</h2>

  <p>The DMC indicator can be disaggregated into imports, domestic extraction
  and exports by a large number of material follow categories. At the highest
  level of aggregation biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores and non-metallic
  minerals are distinguished. DMC is usually reported for 11 material
  categories, DE for 44 material categories. </p>
