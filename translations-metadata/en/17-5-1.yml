  <p>Definition:</p>

  <p>The indicator provides the number of countries that have adopted and
  implemented investment promotion regimes for developing countries, including
  least developed countries.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p><u>Investment promotion regimes</u> can be defined as those instruments
  that directly aim at encouraging outward or inward foreign investment through
  particular measures of the home or host countries of investment. </p>

  <p>Investment promotion regimes for LDCs are those instruments that <em>home
  countries</em> of investors have put in place to <em>encourage outward
  investment in LDCs directly or through measures intended for developing
  countries. </em></p>

  <p><u>Home country</u> refers to donor countries that put in place investment
  promotion regimes to encourage outward investment in developing countries,
  including LDCs. </p>

  <p><u>Foreign direct investment</u> involves a long-term relationship and
  reflects a lasting interest and control by a resident entity in one economy
  (foreign direct investor or parent enterprise) in an enterprise resident in an
  economy other than that of the foreign direct investor (FDI enterprise or
  affiliate enterprise or foreign affiliate).</p>

  <p><u>Adoption</u> means that a country has put in place such a system i.e.
  through the formal adoption of a law, regulation or programme to encourage
  investment in developing countries, including LDCs. </p>

  <p><u>Implementation</u> means that a country has actually started to promote
  individual investments in developing countries, including LDCs, on the basis
  of the relevant legislation. </p>

  <p><u>Instruments</u> used under investment promotion regimes include
  investment guarantees, financial or fiscal support for outward investors as
  well as the conclusion of international investment agreements between the home
  and the host country of the investor. Besides these legal instruments,
  countries often also provide information and other advisory services for their
  outward investors. </p>

  <p><u>Investment guarantee</u> is an insurance, offered by governments of the
  home country or other institutions, to investors to protect against certain
  political risks in host countries, such as the risk of discrimination,
  expropriation, transfer restrictions or breach of contract<u>.</u></p>

  <p><u>International investment agreement</u> is a treaty between two or more
  countries regarding the promotion and protection of investments made by
  investors from one country in the other country&#x2019;s territory, which
  commits the host country government to grant certain standards of treatment
  and protection to foreign investors (nationals and companies of the other
  country) and their investments.</p>
UNIT_MEASURE: <p>The unit of measurement is the number of countries.</p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>Target economies and their numerical codes applied as in the UNCTADStat and
  in line with the ISO 3166-1 standard and the Standard Country or Area Codes
  for Statistical Use (M49) of the United Nations Statistics Division
  (UNSD).</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Data sources include the following: </p>

  <p>&#x25CF; Survey responses on investment guarantee schemes for outward
  investment in LDCs specifically or developing countries in general;</p>

  <p>&#x25CF; Survey responses on fiscal or financial support for outward
  investors in LDCs specially or developing countries in general;</p>

  <p>&#x25CF; Internet research carried out by UNCTAD;</p>

  <p>&#x25CF; UNCTAD database with information on international investment
  agreements (IIA Navigator), including agreements concluded with LDCs and
  developing economies.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>Preliminary data are collected through the following means: </p>

  <p>&#x25CF; An in-depth pilot survey where a limited number of countries that
  offer outward investment promotion are contacted and asked for detailed
  information;</p>

  <p>&#x25CF; A less detailed online questionnaire for all outward investment
  promotion agencies; </p>

  <p>&#x25CF; Internet research carried out by UNCTAD;</p>

  <p>&#x25CF; UNCTAD database on international investment agreements (IIA
  Navigator). </p>

  <p>The official counterparts at the country level are national ministries and
  outward investment promotion agencies. The agency in charge may vary across
  countries depending on the national structure. </p>
FREQ_COLL: <p>UNCTAD started to collect data in July 2019 with a pilot study. </p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>The release of the indicator can start when sufficient country coverage has
  been reached. It is expected that first results for the indicator will be
  available by the end of 2020 with preliminary estimates. Considering the wide
  range of source data needed, the compilers will have to strike a balance
  between exhaustiveness of details on types of investment promotion and
  timeliness of the indicator.</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>Data providers include national ministries, outward investment promotion
  agencies and other international organisations.</p>
COMPILING_ORG: <p>UNCTAD will compile the collected national data to report it globally.</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The UNCTAD IIA Navigator is a comprehensive free database of international
  investment agreements (IIAs). It is primarily built on information provided by
  governments on a voluntary basis, as well as other reliable sources. The IIA
  Navigator is continuously adjusted as a result of verification with, and
  comments from, UN member States. The IIA Navigator contains information on
  IIAs by country and country grouping, a detailed mapping of the provisions of
  2,500 IIAs and a collection of model IIAs. </p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Target 17.5 aims to adopt and implement investment promotion regimes for
  the least developed countries (LDCs). For the purpose of target 17.5, it is
  necessary to find out how many countries have put in place investment
  promotion regimes that may benefit LDCs directly. Therefore, SDG indicator
  17.5.1, the number of countries that adopt and implement investment promotion
  regimes for developing countries, including least developed countries, has
  been selected onto the indicator framework to assess the achievement of this
  target.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>SDG indicator 17.5.1 calls for the measurement of both adoption and
  implementation of investment promotion regimes. The adoption of investment
  promotion regimes for LDCs is an important yet not sufficient means for
  strengthening the global partnership for the SGDs (Goal 17). Subsequent
  implementation of these regimes is necessary for making the tool effective.
  However, getting comprehensive and reliable data on the implementation stage
  (i.e. how many investments in LDCs have actually been promoted through the
  promotion regime?) will be difficult. These data are usually not publicly
  available. However, to some extent, data may exist in aggregate form (see
  below). </p>

  <p>Furthermore, the pilot study indicated that many developed countries and
  some emerging economies have national investment promotion regimes in place
  that encourage investment abroad. Usually, however, these promotion regimes
  are available for outward investment in any country &#x2013; not only for
  investment in LDCs or other developing economies. Some types of investment
  promotion tools can be more country-specific, like bilateral investment
  treaties. Therefore, indicator reporting will be started with preliminary
  estimates covering these types of investment promotion tools only.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The proposed computation method includes the following in the compilation
  of SDG indicator 17.5.1: </p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong><em>Target countries of outward investment promotion regimes </em></strong></li>
  </ol>

  <p>The indicator methodology covers both: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Specific investment promotion regimes targeted for LDCs only; </li>
    <li>Investment promotion regimes for developing countries in general, including LDCs. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The measurement should include investment promotion regimes for all
  developing countries. Only this approach ensures getting a full picture of
  outward investment promotion with LDCs as beneficiaries, which is better
  aligned with Target 17.5. By contrast, limiting the research to specific
  promotion regimes for LDCs only would result in partial information, because
  the number of LDCs that receive support through investment promotion regimes
  for all developing countries is likely to be much higher than the number of
  LDCs that benefit from LDC-specific promotion regimes. Therefore, both types
  are included when identifying the countries that have adopted and implemented
  investment promotion regimes for developing countries, including least
  developed countries.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong><em>Types of outward investment promotion regimes </em></strong></li>
  </ol>

  <p>Based on consultations and feasibility studies on <em>what types</em> of
  investment promotion regimes to look at, the following methodology is
  suggested: </p>

  <p>Countries use various means to promote foreign investment abroad (see above
  &#x201C;Concepts&#x201D;). Indicator 17.5.1 will focus on the legal investment
  instruments, since relevant information is &#x2013; to various degrees -
  usually publicly available, and thus feasible to compile. </p>

  <p>Information is less frequently available on informal and ad-hoc means of
  outward investment promotion, such as advisory services. The availability of
  reliable information on such measures would vary greatly across countries.
  Thus, including such information would hamper the international comparability
  of the indicator.</p>

  <p>To be included in the number of countries that have adopted and implemented
  investment promotion regimes, the existence of at least one type of promotion
  instrument (e.g. an investment guarantee scheme or IIAs with LDCs) would be
  sufficient.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong><em>Adoption vs. implementation of outward investment promotion regimes </em></strong></li>
  </ol>

  <p>Consultations and feasibility studies were carried out on whether &#x2013;
  in addition to the existence of an outward investment promotion regime, i.e.,
  whether such tools were signed or otherwise adopted &#x2013; it would also be
  feasible to examine as to what extent the regime was actually
  <em>implemented,</em> i.e., whether the regime is in force or even if an LDC
  <em>actually benefitted</em> from it, e.g., by receiving a foreign investment
  promoted by an investment guarantee. It was concluded to focus the research on
  the <em>adoption</em> of a promotion system as such. For some types of
  regimes, like bilateral investment treaties, data can also be presented for
  treaties that are in force. Otherwise information on the actual stage of
  implementation in individual countries is usually not publicly available;
  scattered data about the situation in some countries could not provide a
  comprehensive and reliable picture of the overall situation. However, it may
  be possible to come up with some aggregate data at the regional or global
  level (see below).</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong><em>Coverage of home countries of outward investment promotion regimes </em></strong></li>
  </ol>

  <p>There is also a question of <em>which countries</em> should be included in
  the measure as home countries of outward investment promotion regimes. The
  indicator will not only include measures put in place by developed countries
  but also by emerging economies, thus measuring South-South cooperation in this
  respect in addition. </p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>UNCTAD is in continuous consultation with member States to collect and
  update information on IIAs, reviewing the quality and comprehensiveness of the
  IIA Navigator. </p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p>&#x2022; At country level</p>

  <p>When national data are missing, data may be obtained through Internet
  research globally. Numerous countries have a website that provides &#x2013; to
  the various extent &#x2013; information on national outward investment
  promotion regimes. These data would be verified with the national
  authorities.</p>

  <p>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</p>

  <p>In order to calculate regional and global levels, missing data may be
  estimated using information from international sources (e.g. OECD and UNCTAD
  databases).</p>

  <p> Such data may only be available in an aggregated form.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>As explained under data sources, UNCTAD will combine data collected from
  national authorities with information sourced from international databases and
  Internet research, as necessary. Once country data have been completed and
  verified with member States, the indicator will be calculated by aggregating
  the country data within a specific sub-region, region and globally. Each
  country that has at least one type of investment promotion regime in place
  that supports LDCs either directly or through measures intended for developing
  countries will be counted once for indicator 17.5.1.</p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>UNCTAD has published guidance documents specifically on outward investment
  promotion, related definitions and data: </p>

  <p>Specific guidance for countries on how to compile data at the national
  level is contained in the questionnaire that UNCTAD has developed and sent to
  outward investment promotion agencies.</p>
QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>To manage the quality of the indicator data, UNCTAD works in close
  collaboration with member States on updates of the IIA Navigator, as well as
  on international investment agreements and their reform, the provision of
  technical assistance and intergovernmental meetings as part of UNCTAD&#x2019;s
  broader mandate in this area. </p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>The data received from member States will go through a thorough validation
  process. Once the information has been validated and information from
  additional sources incorporated, any questions for clarification or proposals
  are shared with member States for their review.</p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>Currently, comprehensive data is available only on bilateral investment
  treaties. For other types of investment promotion regimes, work continues to
  improve reporting jointly with member States. </p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p>Data availability:</p>

  <p>Currently, preliminary results for a UNCTAD pilot exercise consisting of a
  detailed questionnaire and a less detailed online questionnaire on existing
  outward investment promotion regimes for developing countries, including LDCs,
  are available. Replies have been received from five countries (on the detailed
  questionnaire) and from 26 countries on the shorter questionnaire. The answers
  received vary considerably in their degree of substance and detail. </p>

  <p>Further data will be available on the government websites of home
  countries. In 2020, in-house internet research provided information on 19
  countries.</p>

  <p>Concerning international investment agreements, UNCTAD&#x2019;s database on
  this aspect is comprehensive and currently includes detailed information on
  over 3,300 treaties, including agreements concluded with or between LDCs. </p>

  <p>Time series:</p>

  <p>The data on international investment agreements comprehensively covers
  bilateral investment treaties, the main type of such agreements, signed from
  1959 to 2020.</p>

  <p>Disaggregation:</p>

  <p>In the future, and to the extent that information is available, indicator
  17.5.1 can be disaggregated by type of investment promotion regimes that home
  countries adopt for developing countries, including LDCs (e.g. investment
  guarantees, fiscal and financial aid, IIAs).</p>

  <p>A geographical breakdown of the adoption of investment promotion schemes
  would also be possible. </p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>Sources of discrepancies:</p>

  <p>As mentioned above, countries have different outward investment promotion
  regimes in operation. Differences exist concerning: </p>

  <p>&#x25CF; the specificity of the system (does it target exclusively
  investment in LDCs or investment in any developing country?);</p>

  <p>&#x25CF; the type and number of investment promotion instruments
  (investment guarantees, fiscal or financial support, IIAs);</p>

  <p>&#x25CF; the degree of investment promotion (how much support does the
  individual promotion measure provide?), and </p>

  <p>&#x25CF; the actual impact of the investment promotion regime (how many
  investments have been made under the promotion regime and what effect do they
  have in the LDCs?).</p>

  <p>Indicator 17.5.1 measures the number of countries that have an investment
  promotion regime in place for developing countries, including LDCs. Counting
  this number cannot provide a complete picture of the content and impact of
  these regimes. Likewise, it does not differentiate between countries with
  different types of regimes &#x2013; except for the distinction between
  countries that promote outward investment in LDCs through an LDC-specific
  promotion system and those with a more general promotion regime. Therefore,
  disaggregation of the indicator should be gradually increased as more data
  become available. Further work to measure the &#x201C;implementation&#x201D;
  of investment promotion regimes for developing countries, including LDCs,
  could be pursued in the longer-term.</p>
