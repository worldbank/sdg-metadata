  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>This indicator measures the percentage of women and girls aged 15 years and
  older who have experienced sexual violence by persons other than an intimate
  partner, in the previous 12 months. </p>

  <p>Definition of sexual violence against women and girls is presented in the
  next section (Concepts).</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>According to the UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against
  Women (1993), Violence against Women is &#x201C;Any act of gender-based
  violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or
  psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts,
  coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or
  in private life. Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but
  not be limited to, the following: [&#x2026;], Physical, sexual and
  psychological violence occurring within the general community, including rape,
  sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in educational
  institutions and elsewhere, trafficking in women and forced prostitution
  [&#x2026;]&#x201D;. See here for full definition:
  http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm</p>

  <p>Sexual violence is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual
  behaviour that is imposed on someone. It includes acts of abusive sexual
  contact, forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts
  without consent, incest, sexual harassment, etc. However, in most surveys that
  collect data on sexual violence against women and girls by non-partners the
  information collected is limited to forcing someone into sexual intercourse
  when she does not want to, as well as attempting to force someone to perform a
  sexual act against her will or attempting to force her into sexual
  intercourse. </p>

  <p>For a more detailed definition of sexual violence against women see
  <em>Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical
  Surveys</em> (UN, 2014).</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The main sources of intimate partner violence prevalence data are (1)
  specialized national surveys dedicated to measuring violence against women and
  (2) international household surveys that include a module on experiences of
  violence by women, such as the DHS.</p>

  <p>Although administrative data from health, police, courts, justice and
  social services, among other services used by survivors of violence, can
  provide information on violence against women and girls, these do not produce
  prevalence data, but rather incidence data or number of cases received
  in/reported to these services. We know that many abused women do not report
  violence and those who do, tend to be only the most serious cases. Therefore,
  administrative data should not be used as a data source for this indicator.
  </p>

  <p>For more information on recommended practices in production of violence
  against women statistics see: <em>UN Guidelines for Producing Statistics on
  Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys</em> (UN, 2014).</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>An Inter-Agency Group on Violence against Women Data and its Technical
  Advisory Group is currently being established (jointly by WHO, UN Women,
  UNICEF, UNSD and UNFPA) to establish a mechanism for compiling harmonized
  country level data on this indicator.</p>
FREQ_COLL: <p>NA</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: <p>NA</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>National Statistical Offices (in most cases) or line ministries/other
  government agencies that have conducted national surveys on violence against
  women and girls.</p>
COMPILING_ORG: '<p>UN Women, UNICEF, UNSD, WHO, UNFPA</p>'
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Violence against women and girls is one of the most pervasive forms of
  human rights violations in the world. Evidence has shown that globally, an
  estimated 7% of women have been sexually assaulted by someone other than a
  partner at some point in their lives (WHO et al., 2013). Having data on this
  indicator will help understand the extent and nature of this form of violence
  and develop appropriate policies and programmes.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p><u>Comparability:</u></p>

  <p>The availability of comparable data remains a challenge in this area as
  many data collection efforts have relied on different survey methodologies and
  used different definitions of sexual violence and different survey question
  formulation. Diverse age groups are also often utilized. Willingness to
  discuss experiences of violence and understanding of relevant concepts may
  also differ according to the cultural context and this can affect reported
  prevalence levels.</p>

  <p>Efforts and investment will be required to develop an
  internationally-agreed standard and definition of sexual violence by
  non-partners that will enable comparison across countries.</p>

  <p><u>Regularity of data production:</u></p>

  <p>Since 1995, only some 40 countries have conducted more than one survey on
  violence against women and girls. Obtaining data on violence against women and
  girls is a costly and time-consuming exercise, no matter if they are obtained
  through stand-alone dedicated surveys or through modules inserted in other
  surveys. Not all VAW surveys, however, collect information on non-intimate
  partner violence. Monitoring this indicator with certain periodicity may be a
  challenge if sustained capacities are not built and financial resources are
  not available.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>This indicator calls for disaggregation by age group and place of
  occurrence. No standard definitions and methods have been globally agreed yet
  to collect data on the place where the violence occurs, therefore this is not
  presented at this point in the computation method below. </p>

  <p>Number of women and girls aged 15 years and above who experience sexual
  violence by persons other than an intimate partner in the previous 12 months
  divided by the number of women and girls aged 15 years and above in the
  population multiplied by 100.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>

  <p>When data for a country are entirely missing, no country-level estimate is
  published. </p>

  <p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>

  <p>No imputations are made in cases where country data are not available.
  Where regional and global figures are presented, clear notes on data
  limitations are provided. The number of countries included in the average is
  clearly indicated.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Global aggregates are weighted averages of all the sub-regions that make up
  the world. Regional aggregates are weighted averages of all the countries
  within the region. Where data are not available for all countries in a given
  region, regional aggregates may still be calculated if the minimum threshold
  for population coverage is met. The number of countries included in the
  average is clearly indicated.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>About 100 countries have conducted violence against women national
  prevalence surveys or have included a module on violence against women in a
  national household survey on other topic, although not all include data on
  non-partner sexual violence. Moreover, not all these data are comparable and
  in many cases they are not collected on a regular basis.</p>

  <p>Comparable data are available for a sub-sample of women and girls aged
  15-49 for 37 low- and middle-income countries.</p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>Time series are available for some countries. Global time series with
  comparable data not yet available. </p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>In addition to age and place of occurrence, income/wealth, education,
  ethnicity (including indigenous status), disability status, geographic
  location, relationship with the perpetrator (including sex of perpetrator) and
  frequency and type of sexual violence (as proxy to severity) are suggested as
  desired variables for disaggregation for this indicator.</p>
