  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The tuberculosis incidence per 100 000 population is defined as the
  estimated number of new and relapse TB cases (all forms of TB, including cases
  in people living with HIV) arising in a given year, expressed as a rate per
  100 000 population.</p>

  <h3>Concepts:</h3>

  <p>Direct measurement requires high-quality surveillance systems in which
  underreporting is negligible, and strong health systems so that
  under-diagnosis is also negligible; otherwise indirect estimates are based on
  notification data and estimates of levels of underreporting and
  under-diagnosis.</p>

  <p>National TB Programmes report their annual TB data to WHO every year
  between March and June using a standardized online data reporting system
  maintained at WHO. The system includes real-time checks for data consistency.
  Estimates of TB burden are prepared in July-August and communicated with
  countries. In selected countries with new survey data, estimates are updated
  separately during the year. All estimates are communicated in August-September
  and revisions are done based on feedback. The final set of estimates is
  reviewed in WHO before publication in October, for compliance with specific
  international standards and harmonization of breakdowns for age and sex
  groups.</p>

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Following two years of consultations, a post-2015 global tuberculosis
  strategy was endorsed by the World Health Assembly in May 2014. Known as the
  End TB Strategy, it covers the period 2016-2035. The overall goal is to
  &#x201C;End the global tuberculosis epidemic&#x201D;, and correspondingly
  ambitious targets for reductions in tuberculosis deaths and cases are set for
  2030 (80% reduction in incidence rate compared with the level of 2015) and
  2035 (90% reduction in incidence rate), in the context of the SDGs.</p>

  <p>The tuberculosis incidence rate was selected as an indicator for measuring
  reductions in the number of cases of disease burden. Although this indicator
  was estimated with considerable uncertainty in most countries in 2014,
  notifications of cases to national authorities provide a good proxy if there
  is limited under-reporting of detected cases and limited under or
  over-diagnosis of cases.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>TB incidence has been used for over a century as a main indicator of TB
  burden, along with TB mortality. The indicator allows comparisons over time
  and between countries. Improvement in the quality of TB surveillance data
  result in reduced uncertainty about indicator values.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Estimates of TB incidence are produced through a consultative and
  analytical process led by WHO and are published annually. These estimates are
  based on annual case notifications, assessments of the quality and coverage of
  TB notification data, national surveys of the prevalence of TB disease and
  information from death (vital) registration systems.</p>

  <p>Estimates of incidence for each country are derived, using one or more of
  the following approaches depending on available data: (i) incidence = case
  notifications/estimated proportion of cases detected; (ii) capture-recapture
  modelling, (iii) incidence = prevalence/duration of condition.</p>

  <p>Uncertainty bounds are provided in addition to best estimates.</p>

QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>All health statistics published by WHO undergo a systematic internal review
  process from the Data Division, including TB burden statistics. External
  review of specific statistics is conducted in various ways, including through
  country consultations and reviews by technical review bodies such as the WHO
  Task Force on TB Impact Measurement.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>The underlying TB data reported by WHO member states is carefully checked
  for completeness and internal consistency. Additional data sources are used in
  the process of disease burden estimation, including survey results, according
  to methods published in WHO documents mentioned in previous sections and cited
  in section 7.</p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>TB surveillance data are assessed systematically through so-called
  epidemiological reviews, which provide data quality scores used to update
  plans for strengthening TB surveillance and used in models to estimate the
  burden of TB. In addition, the data are reviewed internally for consistency.
  Data and estimates are published in the form of country profiles used in
  systematic consultations with countries, as mentioned in previous sections and
  cited in section 7. Results are published in detail in publicly available
  annual global TB reports</p>
