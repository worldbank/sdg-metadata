  <p>Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and

SDG_TARGET: >-
  <p>Target 11.6: By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of
  cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and
  other waste management</p>
SDG_INDICATOR: >-
  <p>Indicator 11.6.2: Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g.
  PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>) in cities (population weighted)</p>
SDG_SERIES_DESCR: <p>Applies to all series</p>

  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5
  microns in diameters (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) is a common measure of air pollution.
  The mean is a population-weighted average for urban population in a country,
  and is expressed in micrograms per cubic meter [&#xB5;g/m<sup>3</sup>].</p>
UNIT_MEASURE: '<p>Micrograms per cubic meter [&#xB5;g/m<sup>3</sup>]</p>'
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>The PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations are geographically classified according
  to the 2021 United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) Degree of Urbanization
  classification: cities, towns and rural areas. Data is also provided for urban
  (aggregation of cities and towns) and all (aggregation of cities, towns and
  rural) areas.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Sources of data include ground measurements from monitoring networks,
  collected for 6,000 cities and localities (WHO, 2022) around the world,
  satellite remote sensing, population estimates, topography, information on
  local monitoring networks and measures of specific contributors of air
  pollution (WHO, 2022).</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>Data collection process for ground measurements include official reporting
  from countries to WHO (after request), and web searches. Measurements of
  PM<sub>10</sub> or PM<sub>2.5</sub> from official national/sub-national
  reports and websites or reported by regional networks such as Clean Air Asia
  for Asia and the European Environment Agency for Europe or data from UN
  agencies, development agencies, articles from peer reviewed journals and
  ground measurements are compiled in the framework of the Global Burden of
  Disease Project.</p>
FREQ_COLL: <p>Ongoing</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: <p>The global database for indicator 11.6.2 is released every 2 to 3 years</p>
DATA_SOURCE: '<p>Ministry of Health, Ministry of the Environment</p>'
COMPILING_ORG: <p>World Health Organization (WHO)</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) is the Custodian Agency or co-Custodian
  Agency for reporting on several SDG indicators, including indicator 11.6.2,
  annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g. PM<sub>2.5</sub> and
  PM<sub>10</sub>) in cities (population weighted)).</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Air pollution consists of many pollutants, among other particulate matter.
  These particles are able to penetrate deeply into the respiratory tract and
  therefore constitute a risk for health by increasing mortality from
  respiratory infections and diseases, lung cancer, and selected cardiovascular
  diseases.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p><strong>Urban/rural data:</strong> while the data quality available for
  urban/rural population is generally good for high-income countries, it can be
  relatively poor for some low- and middle income areas. Furthermore, the
  definition of urban/rural may greatly vary by country.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The annual urban mean concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub> is estimated with
  improved modelling using data integration from satellite remote sensing,
  population estimates, topography and ground measurements (WHO, 2016; Shaddick
  et al, 2016).</p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>Draft estimates are reviewed with Member States through a WHO country
  consultation process and SDG focal points every time new data are generated.
  In addition, the methods and data are published in a peer-reviewed
  journal.</p>

  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator is available for 232 countries. Missing countries include
  mostly Small State Islands in the Western Pacific and in the Latin American
  and the Caribbean regions.</p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator provides estimates from 2010 to most recent reporting period.
  Previous data estimates are updated with when there have been changes in
  modelling method and input data.</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator is available by 0.1&#xB0; x 0.1&#xB0; grid size for the
  world. National, regional and global data are disaggregated into cities,
  towns, urban and rural areas. </p>
