  <p><strong>Definition, rationale and concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>The ultimate objective of the Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC) is to
  achieve the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere
  at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the
  climate system. Estimating the levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and
  removals is an important element of the efforts to achieve this objective.</p>

  <p>In accordance with Articles 4 and 12 of the Climate Change Convention and
  the relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties, countries that are
  Parties to the Convention submit national GHG inventories to the Climate
  Change secretariat. These submissions are made in accordance with the
  reporting requirements adopted under the Convention, such as the revised
  &#x201C;Guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Parties
  included in Annex I to the Convention, Part I: UNFCCC reporting guidelines on
  annual greenhouse gas inventories&#x201D; (decision 24/CP.19) for Annex I
  Parties and &#x201C;Guidelines for the preparation of national communications
  for non-Annex I Parties&#x201D; (decision 17/CP.8). The inventory data are
  provided in the annual GHG inventory submissions by Annex I Parties and in the
  national communications and biennial update reports by non-Annex I
  Parties.</p>

  <p>The Paris Agreement adopted in 2015 marks the latest step in the evolution
  of the UN climate change regime and builds on the work undertaken under the
  Convention. Its central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat
  of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below
  2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit
  the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Agreement
  also aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of
  climate change.</p>

  <p>&#x2022; Annex I GHG inventories are submitted through the CRF Reporter
  application. Information are automatically imported in the UNFCCC Data

  <p>&#x2022; Information for non-Annex I Parties are manually extracted from

  <p> The UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories for Annex I Parties
  require each Annex I Party to provide its annual GHG inventory by 15 April
  each year.</p>

  <p>The national communications (NCs) of non-Annex I Parties are usually
  submitted every four years; the biennial update reports (BURs) every two
  years.</p>

  <p>Data is limited to Parties that submit their GHG inventories. As the
  reporting requirements for non-Annex I Parties are not as rigid as those for
  Annex I Parties, information for these Parties are available usually only for
  selected years.</p>

  <p>The annual timing of submission of updated inventory reports is very close
  to publication date of annual SDG progress reports.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Total GHG emissions are calculated as the sum of emissions of direct GHGs:
  carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), perfluorocarbons
  (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen
  trifluoride (NF3), measured in units of CO2-equivalent, by using a common
  weighting factor, the so-called Global Warming Potentials (GWP). In accordance
  with the latest reporting guidelines for Annex I Parties under the UNFCCC, the
  GWP values to be used are those for the 100-year time horizon listed in Table
  2.14 of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report
  (https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar4/wg1/). However, non-Annex I Parties should use
  the GWP provided in the IPCC Second Assessment Report
  (https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ipcc-second-assessment-full-report/) based on the
  effects of GHGs over a 100-year time.</p>

  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>Based on national inventory reports submitted to the UNFCCC secretariat,
  total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Gt CO2 eq of developed countries (43
  Annex I Parties under UNFCCC) from 1990 onwards and developing countries (153
  non-Annex I Parties under UNFCCC) from 2000 onwards. Annex I Parties submit
  their GHG inventories annually (submission deadline is 15 April), whereas
  non-Annex I Parties submit their national communications/biennial update
  reports only periodically.</p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>Data for Annex I Parties are available from the base year (usually 1990) up
  to two years before the inventory is due. Data available for non-Annex I
  Parties are usually only for selected years.</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>Data is disaggregated by Annex I and Non-Annex I Parties to the UNFCCC</p>
