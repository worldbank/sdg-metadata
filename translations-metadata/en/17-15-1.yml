  <p>Definition:</p>

  <p>This indicator measures the extent to which, and the ways in which, all
  concerned development partners use country-owned results frameworks (CRFs) to
  plan development cooperation efforts and assess their performance. </p>

  <p>The indicator assesses the degree to which providers of development
  cooperation (i.e. development partners) design their interventions by relying
  on objectives and results indicators that are drawn from country
  government-owned results frameworks reflecting the country&#x2019;s
  development priorities and goals. </p>

  <p>Concepts:</p>

  <p>Country-owned results frameworks (CRFs) define a country&#x2019;s approach
  to results and its associated monitoring and evaluation systems focusing on
  performance and achievement of development results. Using a minimal
  definition, these results frameworks include agreed objectives and results
  indicators (i.e. output, outcome, and/or impact). They also set targets to
  measure progress in achieving the objectives defined in the
  government&#x2019;s planning documents. </p>

  <p>The definition of country-owned results framework used for this indicator
  allows the possibility to use equivalent priority-setting mechanisms at the
  country level since not all countries articulate their priorities through
  consistent, integrated CRFs.</p>

  <p>In practice, country-owned results frameworks defined at the country level
  are often broadly stated (e.g. long-term vision plans, national development
  strategies) and operationalised in more detail at the sector level (e.g.
  sector strategies), where specific targets and indicators are set for a given
  timeframe.</p>

  <p>Some examples of CRFs are long-term vision plans; national development
  strategies; joint government-multi-donor plans; government&#x2019;s sector
  strategies, policies and plans; subnational planning instruments, as well as
  other frameworks (e.g. budget support performance matrices, sector-wide
  approaches). In contrast, planning and priority setting documents produced
  outside the government, such as country strategies prepared by development
  partners, are not considered CRFs.</p>
UNIT_MEASURE: <p>Proportion</p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>For developing countries, classification is based on SDG grouping provided
  by the UN Statistical Office (regional classification, LDCs, LLDCs, SIDS).
  Income classification follows the World Bank grouping (low, lower-middle,
  upper-middle, and high income).</p>

  <p>For development partners, classification is based on SDG grouping. In
  addition, bilateral partners can be distinguished between members of the
  Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and non-members. </p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The monitoring is a voluntary and country-led process. Country governments
  lead and coordinate data collection and validation. At country level, data are
  reported by relevant government entities (e.g. the Ministry of Finance/budget
  department for national budget information) and by development partners and
  stakeholders. OECD and UNDP support countries in collecting relevant data
  through the Global Partnership monitoring exercise, and these organisations
  lead data aggregation and quality assurance at the global level.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>(i) For the data collection process of the Global Partnership&apos;s
  monitoring exercise, a national coordinator is assigned by the country
  government. S/he typically comes from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of
  Planning, or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a Ministry that has a role for
  managing development cooperation and partnerships in accordance to respective
  institutional structure of each country. </p>

  <p>(ii) The national coordinator collects inputs from development partners.
  The data is submitted to the OECD and UNDP and subsequently undergoes a review
  round with the headquarters offices of development partners. </p>

  <p>(iii) No adjustments are made to the data after they have undergone the
  validation process. However, inconsistencies or possible problematic values
  are highlighted and sent back to national coordinators for revision.</p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>The data collection calendar for global data aggregation was on a biennial
  cycle. Data has been collected in 2016 and 2018. The next monitoring round
  will take place starting from 2023. </p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>Data release is scheduled for the first quarter in the year that
  immediately follows the national data gathering processes.</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p><strong>Name:</strong></p>

  <p>Leading central ministry from reporting countries. Typically, the Ministry
  of Finance, the Ministry of Planning, or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
  depending on the division of labour within each government.</p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

  <p>Representatives from the leading ministry in country governments are
  responsible for leading the national data gathering process and country-level
  validation. These representatives coordinate the data collection process at
  the national level by consolidating data and inputs from providers of
  development co-operation, civil society organisations, the private sector, and
  trade unions. For calculation of indicator 17.15.1, country governments submit
  the data to the OECD/UNDP Joint Support Team of the Global Partnership.</p>
COMPILING_ORG: <p>OECD and UNDP jointly compile and report the data at the global level.</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>As custodians of this SDG indicator, OECD and UNDP are responsible for
  providing technical guidance and supporting countries to collect data,
  compiling and verifying country data, and for submitting the country data and
  aggregate data for this indicator. Drawing on their institutional support
  provided to the Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation,
  OECD and UNDP leverage country participation in the Global Partnership
  monitoring exercise, which since 2013 has tracked progress towards the
  effectiveness principles and is the recognised source of data and evidence on
  upholding effectiveness commitments, to aggregate global data for this
  indicator. Countries not participating in the Global Partnership monitoring
  exercise are able to submit their country data directly to OECD and UNDP. </p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Measuring the alignment of development partners&#x2019; support to country
  priorities in terms of intervention design and type of results-reporting
  mechanisms provides a relevant assessment regarding the degree of
  &#x201C;respect for each country&#x2019;s policy space and leadership to
  establish and implement country-owned policies for poverty eradication and
  sustainable development&#x201D;. </p>

  <p>In particular, for interventions approved in the year of reference (i.e.
  most recent behaviour), the assessment measures the extent to which support
  from other countries and international organizations set exogenous priorities
  and conditions to partner countries receiving development co-operation that
  are not reflected in existing country-led priority-setting mechanisms or
  planning tools.</p>

  <p>The information collected throughout the indicator provides a
  &#x201C;two-way mirror&#x201D;, providing both a country-level estimate on a
  country&#x2019;s existing policy space, and a development partner-level
  estimate on its degree of alignment with existing results frameworks and
  priority-setting mechanisms in partner countries where it operates. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The Global Partnership monitoring exercise collects data beyond the scope
  of the proposed indicator, including additional aspects such as quality of
  national development planning, the enabling environment of civil society
  organisations, the quality of public-private dialogue, the predictability of
  development co-operation, and the use of country public financial management
  systems by providers of development co-operation . Data generated from the
  Global Partnership monitoring provide evidence for two additional SDG
  indicators: 17.16.1 and 5.c.1. </p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>To provide a comprehensive measure on the extent of use of country-owned
  results frameworks and other government-led planning tools, the indicator
  calculates the degree to which objectives, results indicators and monitoring
  frameworks associated with new development interventions are drawn from
  government sources &#x2013;including national, sector and subnational planning
  tools.</p>

  <p>For each development intervention of significant size (US$ 100,000 and
  above) approved during the year of reference, the following dimensions are
  assessed:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Q1. Whether objectives are drawn from country-owned results frameworks, plans and strategies 0/1</li>
    <li>Q2. Share of results (outcome) indicators that are drawn from country-owned results frameworks, plans and strategies %</li>
    <li>Q3. Share of results (outcome) indicators that will rely on sources of data provided by existing country-led monitoring systems or national statistical services to track project progress %</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Global aggregates for the indicator (for partner countries and providers)
  are obtained by averaging the three dimensions of alignment with
  country&#x2019;s priorities and goals across all new interventions for the
  reporting year. </p>

  <p>Aggregated averages per partner country will provide the extent to which
  CRFs and planning tools are used by providers of development co-operation
  operating in that specific country in the design and monitoring of new
  development projects. </p>

  <p>All formulas are available at: <a
  href="http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-17.pdf">http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-17.pdf</a></p>

  <p>Aggregated averages per development partner will indicate the extent to
  which that development partner uses CRFs and planning tools in the design and
  monitoring of new development projects in countries in which it operates.
  Formulas are available at: <a
  href="http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-17.pdf">http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-17.pdf</a></p>

  <p>When aggregating, the size (budget amount) of the project/ intervention is
  not considered as weight in order to give the same level of importance to the
  extent of use of country-owned results frameworks and planning tools in
  medium-sized vs. larger projects, as the indicator tries to capture the
  overall behaviour of development partners in designing new interventions in a
  given country. Weighting by project size would otherwise over represent
  infrastructure projects and underrepresent interventions focused on
  influencing policies and institutional arrangements. Nevertheless, data on
  project size is available.</p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>The national coordinator has the main responsibility to validate the
  project level data reported by respective government institutions development
  partners and stakeholders. </p>

  <p>At the global level, the OECD and UNDP review the project level data
  submitted by partner countries in consultation and coordination with
  countries&#x2019; national coordinators and with providers of development
  co-operation.</p>

  <p>Details on the validation process can be found at <a
  href="https://www.effectivecooperation.org/content/2018-monitoring-guide-national-co-ordinators">https://www.effectivecooperation.org/content/2018-monitoring-guide-national-co-ordinators</a>.
  </p>
ADJUSTMENT: <p>Not applicable.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p>&#x2022; At country level</p>

  <p>There is no treatment of missing values. However, a validation process
  involving representatives of country governments and country offices as well
  as headquarters offices of development partners takes place. Missing values
  are highlighted during this validation process, and attempts are made to fill
  in these gaps.</p>

  <p>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</p>

  <p>There is no imputation of missing values. Attempts are made to minimize
  gaps in data submissions during the data validation process including
  triangulation with headquarters offices of development partners.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Global and regional estimates are constructed by making a simple average
  across all countries/providers globally and for a specific region. It was
  decided not to use a weighted average to give equal consideration to small and
  large projects (although project amounts and type are captured in the data to
  allow for more advanced tabulations).</p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>A monitoring guide is available to national coordinators in English, French
  and Spanish. A separate guide in English is also available to providers of
  development cooperation. The guidance is updated regularly. The guide for
  national coordinators is available at
  https://www.effectivecooperation.org/content/2018-monitoring-guide-national-co-ordinators.
  The guide for providers is available at
  https://www.effectivecooperation.org/content/2018-monitoring-round-mini-guide-development-partners.
  </p>
QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>The national coordinator has the main responsibility to ensure the quality
  and comprehensiveness of data for this indicator. OECD and UNDP provide
  helpdesk and guidance materials to support the national coordinator managing
  the quality of data. </p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>The national coordinator has the main responsibility to ensure the quality
  and comprehensiveness of data for this indicator. OECD and UNDP support the
  quality assurance through joint review of data with the national coordinator
  and by engaging development partners at HQ level, UN development system and
  UNDP country offices as needed, and cross checking with data set submitted for
  previous monitoring rounds.</p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>OECD and UNDP support the quality assessment through joint review of data
  with the national coordinator and by engaging development partners at HQ
  level, UN development system and UNDP country offices as needed, and cross
  checking with data set submitted for previous monitoring rounds.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p>Data availability:</p>

  <p>Data collected in the 2016 and 2018 monitoring round generated data for a
  total of 96 recipient countries and for above 100 development partners
  &#x2013;including the 29 countries that are members of the OECD&#x2019;s
  Development Assistance Committee and the six major multilateral organizations
  in terms of development finance (i.e. the World Bank, the International
  Monetary Fund, the United Nations Development Programme, African Development
  Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank). </p>

  <p>Time series:</p>

  <p>Disaggregation:</p>

  <p>Given the bottom-up approach in generating the indicator, disaggregation is
  possible at the country level and at the development partner level.</p>

  <p>While data collection is led at the country level, in a bottom-up approach,
  global and regional aggregates can be used for monitoring
  internationally-agreed commitments related to strengthening country ownership
  and better partner alignment with nationally-set development goals. </p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>Sources of discrepancies:</p>

  <p>National figures are directly aggregated to come up with global
  figures.</p>
