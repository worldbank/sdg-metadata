  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> </p>

  <p>This indicator provides information on the mean hourly earnings from paid
  employment of employees by sex, occupation, age and disability status. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong> </p>

  <p>Earnings refer to the gross remuneration in cash or in kind paid to
  employees, as a rule at regular intervals, for time worked or work done
  together with remuneration for time not worked, such as annual vacation, other
  type of paid leave or holidays. Earnings exclude employers&#x2019;
  contributions in respect of their employees paid to social security and
  pension schemes and also the benefits received by employees under these
  schemes. Earnings also exclude severance and termination pay. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>For international comparability purposes, statistics of earnings used
  relate to employees&#x2019; gross remuneration, i.e. the total before any
  deductions are made by the employer in respect of taxes, contributions of
  employees to social security and pension schemes, life insurance premiums,
  union dues and other obligations of employees. As stated in the indicator
  title, data on earnings should be presented on the basis of the arithmetic
  average of the hourly earnings of all employees. </p>
UNIT_MEASURE: <p>Current local currency </p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>The breakdown by occupation is based on the latest version of the
  International Standard Classification of Occupation (ISCO).</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>There are a variety of possible sources of data on employees&#x2019;
  earnings. </p>

  <p>Establishment surveys are usually the most reliable source, given the high
  accuracy of earnings figures derived from them (the information typically
  comes from the payroll, so is precise). However, the scope of these statistics
  is limited to the coverage of the establishment survey in question (usually
  excluding small establishments, agricultural establishments and/or informal
  sector establishments).</p>

  <p>Household surveys (and especially labour force surveys) can provide
  earnings statistics covering all economic activities, and all establishment
  types and sizes, but the quality of the data is highly dependent on the
  accuracy of respondents&#x2019; answers.</p>

  <p>Data on earnings could also be derived from a variety of administrative
  records.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The ILO Department of Statistics processes national household survey micro
  datasets in line with internationally-agreed indicator concepts and
  definitions set forth by the International Conference of Labour Statisticians.
  For data that could not be obtained through this processing or directly from
  government websites, the ILO sends out an annual ILOSTAT questionnaire to all
  relevant agencies within each country (national statistical office, labour
  ministry, etc.) requesting the latest annual data and any revisions on
  numerous labour market topics and indicators, including many SDG
  indicators.</p>
FREQ_COLL: <p>Continuous </p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: <p>Continuous</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>At the national level, the agency responsible for producing data on
  earnings is usually the national statistical office. </p>
COMPILING_ORG: <p>International Labour Organization (ILO) </p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The ILO is the UN focal point for labour statistics. It sets international
  standards for labour statistics through the International Conference of Labour
  Statisticians. It also compiles and produces labour statistics with the goal
  of disseminating internationally-comparable datasets, and provides technical
  assistance and training to ILO member States to support their efforts to
  produce high quality labour market data.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Earnings are a key aspect of quality of employment and living conditions.
  Information on hourly earnings disaggregated by various classifications (sex,
  age, occupation, disability status) provide some indication of the extent to
  which pay equality is respected or achieved. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The variety of possible sources for statistics on earnings greatly hinders
  international comparability, as each type of source has its own coverage,
  scope and characteristics. It would not be fully accurate to compare, for
  example, hourly earnings from a labour force survey for one country with
  hourly earnings from an establishment survey for another. The use of
  non-standard definitions and the heterogeneity of operational criteria applied
  further hamper cross-country comparisons. </p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p><strong>Computation Method:</strong> </p>

  <p>The method of calculation used to obtain the average hourly earnings of
  employees depends on the source of data used and the type of information it
  provides. For instance, where there is information available on each
  worker&#x2019;s hourly earnings and hours worked, the average is a weighted
  average calculated by summing up the product of each worker&#x2019;s hourly
  earnings times the hours worked and dividing it by the total number of hours
  worked by all workers. In other words:</p>

  <p>Data consistency and quality checks are regularly conducted for validation
  of the data before dissemination in the ILOSTAT database.</p>

  <p> </p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>The final assessment of the quality of information is carried out by the
  Data Production and Analysis Unit of the ILO Department of Department. In
  cases of doubt about the quality of specific data, these values are reviewed
  with the participation of the national agencies responsible for producing the
  data if appropriate. If the issues cannot be clarified, the respective
  information is not published. </p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>Data for this indicator is available for 118 countries and territories.
  </p>

  <p>Time series: The submission covers data from 2000 to 2021.</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>This indicator should be disaggregated by sex, occupation, age and
  disability status. </p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>Earnings statistics present a number of complications in terms of their
  international comparability, most of which arise from the variety of possible
  sources of data. The various sources available -- establishment surveys,
  household surveys and administrative records -- differ in their methods,
  objectives and scope, which influences the results obtained. The coverage of
  the source may vary in terms of the geographical areas covered, the workers
  covered (for example, part-time workers or informal workers may be excluded)
  and the establishments covered (for example, establishments below a certain
  size or of a certain sector may be excluded). In cases where the earnings of
  workers excluded from the coverage of the source are significantly different
  than those of workers included, the statistics would not be representative of
  the country as a whole and would not be strictly comparable to those of
  countries using a more comprehensive source. </p>

  <p>When using household surveys as a source of earnings statistics, there are
  a number of issues related to the accuracy of the earnings information
  reported by the respondents. They may over declare or under declare their
  earnings for various reasons, or they may report gross or net wages while
  including or excluding bonuses and benefits, without distinction. This
  naturally affects the reliability of the results.</p>
