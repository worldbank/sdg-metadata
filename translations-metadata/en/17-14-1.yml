  <p>For the purpose of this methodology &#x2018;policy coherence of sustainable
  development&#x2019; has been interpreted as the coherence between policies in
  general that cover the dimensions of sustainable development. This indicator
  is a composite indicator which covers mechanisms related to </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Institutionalization of Political Commitment </li>
    <li>Long-term considerations in decision-making</li>
    <li>Inter-ministerial and cross-sectoral coordination </li>
    <li>Participatory processes</li>
    <li>Policy linkages</li>
    <li>Alignment across government levels</li>
    <li>Monitoring and reporting for policy coherence</li>
    <li>Financing for policy coherence</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p><em>Scope of &#x201C;Sustainable Development&#x201D; </em>For the purpose
  of this methodology &#x2018;policy coherence of sustainable
  development&#x2019; has been interpreted as the coherence between policies in
  general that cover the dimensions of sustainable development, rather than
  adopting a narrower definition of mechanisms put in place to support the
  coherent implementation of Agenda 2030 and the SDGs, so as to promote coherent
  policy for sustainable development well beyond the current agenda&#x2019;s
  timeframe. The policy coherence mechanisms set out in this methodology may
  therefore include mechanisms already in place before the adoption of the 2030
  Agenda in 2015, and any mechanisms established during the next decade leading
  up to 2030 should aim to continue well beyond that timeframe. However, given
  the role of Agenda 2030 and the individual goals in defining the specific
  parameters of sustainable development, it is likely that governments will
  focus, in implementing this methodology, on bringing coherence in their policy
  approaches to implement the goals. </p>

  <p><em>The concept of Policy Coherence: </em>The textual formulation of the
  indicator covers &#x201C;policy coherence&#x201D;. In order to make the
  indicator universally applicable and adaptable to various national contexts,
  the mechanisms measured by the methodology cover a wide range of mechanisms
  that, although aiming to achieve the same objective, use slightly different
  language. In order to properly assess and report on this indicator similar
  concepts such as &#x201C;whole of government approach or &#x201C;integrated
  approach&#x201D; will be interpreted in the same spirit as the concept of
  &#x201C;policy coherence&#x201D;. However, it is important that the used
  concept considers policies that cover the various dimensions of sustainable
  development. Hence, a mechanism focusing solely on the concept of policy
  coherence for development (which is often limited to coherence between
  Official Development Assistance (ODA) and other policies, in the spirit of the
  Millennium Development Goals) will not be considered by this framework. </p>

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Enhancing policy coherence for sustainable development is important for
  achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions (economic, social
  and environmental) in a balanced and integrated manner; for ensuring coherence
  between policies at various levels of government; and for ensuring that
  policies in different sectors are mutually supportive and do not work against
  each other. It is also important in addressing the impacts of domestic policy
  internationally. </p>

  <p>Policy coherence aims, as a minimum, to identify trade-offs and mitigate
  negative impacts between policies. At a more ambitious level, it should also
  aim to foster synergies and produce policies that mutually reinforce each
  other. </p>

  <p>At a more ambitious level, it should also aim to foster synergies and
  produce policies that mutually reinforce each other, and to ensure that
  policies put in place are implementable and sustainable as they are inclusive
  of the concerned stakeholders&#x2019; perspectives.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>There are many mechanisms that could be useful to assess at the national
  level which would be relevant to enhance policy coherence for sustainable
  development. This methodology aims to provide a basis for countries to engage
  in discussions around what policy coherence means at the national level and
  how it could be improved. Such discussions and strategies to improve policy
  coherence that may results from it could feed into a country Voluntary
  National Review (VNR) or National Development Strategy or Plan development, to
  inform further efforts by the country to improve its ability to implement
  Agenda 2030 through better policy coherence. This document should be
  considered a living document which is regularly updated with the country
  experiences in putting in place and assessing mechanisms for policy coherence.
  These experiences, and related challenges, lessons learned and solutions, can
  be shared so that UNEP as custodian agency, with partners, can further refine
  this methodology and disseminated it not only as a tool to enable effective
  reporting but also to support national efforts toward policy coherence.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>UNEP has developed a composite indicator framework for SDG 17.14.1 based on
  initial research on existing work, literature, partners and existing
  indicators on similar issues. This indicator includes 8 domains. Each is
  scored on a 0-10 point scale. The percentage of points out of the total 80
  points is then computed for each country. It is recommended that Governments
  convene a stakeholder group for self-scoring. The below table can be used for
  scoring. Full details are in the document &#x201C;Methodology for
  SDG-indicator 17.14.1: Mechanisms in place to enhance policy coherence for
  sustainable development&#x201D;.</p>
