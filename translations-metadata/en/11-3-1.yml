  <p>Definitions:</p>

  <p>The indicator is defined as the ratio of land consumption rate to
  population growth rate.</p>

  <p>This indicator requires defining the two components of population growth
  and land consumption rate. Computing the population growth rate is more
  straightforward and more readily available, while land consumption rate is
  slightly challenging, and requires the use of new techniques. In estimating
  the land consumption rate, one needs to define what constitutes
  &#x201C;consumption&#x201D; of land since this may cover aspects of
  &#x201C;consumed&#x201D; or &#x201C;preserved&#x201D; or available for
  &#x201C;development&#x201D; for cases such as land occupied by wetlands.
  Secondly, there is not one unequivocal measure of whether land that is being
  developed is truly &#x201C;newly-developed&#x201D; (or vacant) land, or if it
  is at least partially &#x201C;redeveloped&#x201D;. As a result, the percentage
  of current total urban land that was newly developed (consumed) will be used
  as a measure of the land consumption rate. The fully developed area is also
  sometimes referred to as built up area.</p>

  <p>Concepts:</p>

  <p><strong>City or urban area</strong>: Since 2016 UN-Habitat and partners
  organized global consultations and discussions to narrow down the set of
  meaningful definitions that would be helpful for the global monitoring and
  reporting process. Following consultations with 86 member states, the United
  Nations Statistical Commission, in its 51st Session (March 2020) endorsed the
  Degree of Urbanisation (DEGURBA) as a workable method to delineate cities,
  urban and rural areas for international statistical comparisons.<sup><sup><a
  href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[1]</a></sup> </sup>This definition
  combines population size and population density thresholds to classify the
  entire territory of a country along the urban-rural continuum, and captures
  the full extent of a city, including the dense neighbourhoods beyond the
  boundary of the central municipality. DEGURBA is applied in a two-step
  process: First, 1 km2 grid cells are classified based on population density,
  contiguity and population size. Subsequently, local units are classified as
  urban or rural based on the type of grid cells in which majority of their
  population resides. For the computation of indicator 11.3.1, countries are
  encouraged to adopt the degree of urbanisation to define the analysis area
  (city or urban area).</p>

  <p><strong>Population growth rate (PGR)</strong> is the change of a population
  in a defined area (country, city, etc) during a period, usually one year,
  expressed as a percentage of the population at the start of that period. It
  reflects the number of births and deaths during a period and the number of
  people migrating to and from the focus area. In SDG 11.3.1, this is computed
  at the area defined as urban/city. </p>

  <p><strong>Land consumption</strong> within the context of indicator 11.3.1 is
  defined as the uptake of land by urbanized land uses, which often involves
  conversion of land from non-urban to urban functions. </p>

  <p><strong>Land consumption rate</strong> is the rate at which urbanized land
  or land occupied by a city/urban area changes during a period of time (usually
  one year), expressed as a percentage of the land occupied by the city/urban
  area at the start of that time. </p>

  <p><strong>Built up area </strong>within the context of indicator 11.3.1 is
  defined as all areas occupied by buildings. </p><div

UNIT_MEASURE: >-
  <p>For the two components used to compute of this indicator, i.e a) land
  consumption rate and b) population growth rate, the unit of measurement is a
  percentage value. </p>

  <p>The resulting indicator is measured as a ratio of these two percentages
  making it unitless.</p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>The indicator depends on international classifications on boundaries of
  countries and regions and city boundaries. Guidance on the city definitions is
  provided based on a harmonized global city definition, see: <a
  href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/51st-session/documents/BG-Item3j-Recommendation-E.pdf">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/51st-session/documents/BG-Item3j-Recommendation-E.pdf</a></p>

  <p><strong>Sources and collection process:</strong></p>

  <p>Population data required for this indicator is available from National
  Statistical Offices, UNDESA as well as through newly emerging multi-temporal
  gridded population datasets for the world. Historical built-up area data can
  also be generated for most countries and cities using mid-to-high resolution
  satellite imagery from the Landsat and Sentinel missions. Higher resolution
  data is available for several countries which have a rich repository of earth
  observation missions or partnerships with commercial providers of high to very
  high-resolution imagery. Other sources of data for this indicator include
  urban planning authorities and multi-temporal analytical databases on built-up
  area at the global level produced by organizations working in the earth
  observation field. </p>

  <p>The production of data for this indicator requires some level of
  understanding of geospatial analysis techniques at the country level. Several
  tools have been developed to help with the indicator computation, including
  systems that allow for on-the-cloud analysis, but users still require some
  good level of understanding of the process and geospatial analysis to
  efficiently utilize these tools. Equally, access to internet is needed either
  to download the free satellite imagery or undertake analysis using existing
  cloud-based architecture. </p>

  <p>National level capacity building initiatives will aim to balance the
  knowledge and understanding of the analysis, compilation and reporting of this
  indicator. Global reporting will rely on the estimates that come from the
  national statistical agencies, who should work collaboratively with mapping
  agencies and city data producers. With uniform standards in computation at the
  national level, few errors of omission or bias will be observed at the
  global/regional level. A rigorous analysis routine will be used to re-assess
  the quality and accuracy of the data at the regional and global levels. This
  will involve cross-comparisons with expected ranges of the values reported for
  cities.</p>

  <p>UN-Habitat has developed a simple reporting template that allows countries
  to input data on the intermediate products (built-up area and population) then
  get the computed values for each analysis city and period. The template, which
  will be send to countries every year to report any new data is appended to
  this metadata and can also be accessed <a
  href="https://data.unhabitat.org/datasets/template-for-compilation-of-sdg-indicator-11-3-1">HERE</a>.</p>

COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>Data for this indicator combines earth observation, geospatial analysis and
  use of population data from censuses and surveys. Input data for computation
  of the land consumption rate is extracted from multi-temporal satellite
  imagery through remote sensing and geospatial analysis processes. The quality
  of data for this component is greatly reliant on the resolution of the input
  satellite imagery, but the freely available Landsat and Sentinel Imagery
  provide good quality data that can consistently be used to compute the
  indicator. The methods of extracting data from these imageries vary from
  standalone commercial and open-source software (eg Erdas Imagine, Saga GIS,
  ENVI, etc) to cloud based processing systems such as Google Earth Engine. </p>

  <p>Computation of the population growth rate component of the indicator relies
  on data from statistical sources such as censuses, which should be
  disaggregated to the smallest units possible. Use of population modelling
  approaches (such as to produce gridded population datasets) is encouraged
  where high resolution data from the National Statistical Offices is not
  available. The approaches for disaggregating population to grids vary, but the
  most common ones include disaggregating populations to built-up areas. Some
  examples of common approaches are provided in the references section. </p>

  <p> To implement the Degree of Urbanisation approach to city/urban area
  definition, which is proposed for this indicator computation, the European
  Commission Joint Research Centre (EC-JRC) have developed a standalone
  application which uses either locally or globally produced input data on
  population and built up layers. The tool is available HERE, while the
  description of how to implement the approach is available HERE. </p>

  <p> </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>The monitoring of the indicator can be repeated at regular intervals of 5
  years, allowing for three reporting points until the year 2030. Since this
  indicator considers historical growth trends of urban areas, analysis can
  cover periods as far back as data allows. </p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>Updates will be undertaken every year, which would allow for annual updates
  in reporting at the global level.</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>UN-Habitat and other partners such as the Global Human Settlement Layer
  (GHSL) team, the German Aerospace Center (DLR), partners in the Group on Earth
  Observations (GEO) and ESRI among others will support various components for
  reporting on this indicator. The global responsibility of building the
  capacity of national governments and statistical agencies to report on this
  indicator will be led by UN-Habitat. National governments/national statistical
  agencies will have the primary responsibility of reporting on this indicator
  at national level with the support of UN-Habitat to ensure uniform standards
  in analysis and reporting.</p>
COMPILING_ORG: >-
  <p>UN-Habitat with the support of other selected partners will lead the
  compilation of data for this indicator.</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) is the
  specialized agency for sustainable urbanization and human settlements in the
  United Nations. The mandate derives from the priorities established in
  relevant General Assembly resolutions and decisions, including General
  Assembly resolution 3327 (XXIX), by which the General Assembly established the
  United Nations Habitat and Human Settlements Foundation, and resolution 32/162
  by which the Assembly established the United Nations Center for Human
  Settlements (Habitat). In 2001, by its Resolution 56/206, the General Assembly
  transformed the Habitat into the secretariat of the United Nations Human
  Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), with a mandate to coordinate human
  settlements activities within the United Nations System. As such, UN-Habitat
  has been designated the overall coordinator of SDG 11 and specifically as a
  custodian agency for 9 of the 15 indicators under SDG 11 including indicator
  11.3.1. UN-Habitat also supports the monitoring and reporting of 4 urban
  specific indicators in other goals.</p>
OTHER_METHOD: ''
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Globally, land cover today is altered principally by direct human use: by
  agriculture and livestock raising, forest harvesting and management and urban
  and suburban construction and development. A defining feature of many of the
  world&#x2019;s cities is an outward expansion far beyond formal administrative
  boundaries, largely propelled by the use of the automobile, poor urban and
  regional planning and land speculation. A large proportion of cities both from
  developed and developing countries have high consuming suburban expansion
  patterns, which often extend to even further peripheries. A global study on
  120 cities shows that urban land cover has, on average, grown more than three
  times as much as the urban population [1]; in some cases similar studies at
  national level showed a difference that was three to five times fold. [3]. In
  order to effectively monitor land consumption growth, it is not only necessary
  to have the information on existing land use cover but also the capability to
  monitor the dynamics of land use resulting out of both changing demands of
  increasing population and forces of nature acting to shape the landscape.</p>

  <p>Cities require an orderly urban expansion that makes the land use more
  efficient. They need to plan for future internal population growth and city
  growth resulting from migrations. They also need to accommodate new and
  thriving urban functions such as transportation routes, etc., as they expand.
  However, frequently the physical growth of urban areas is disproportionate in
  relation to population growth, and these results in land use that is less
  efficient in many forms. This type of growth turns out to violate every
  premise of sustainability that an urban area could be judged by including
  impacting on the environment and causing other negative social and economic
  consequences such as increasing spatial inequalities and lessening of
  economies of agglomeration.</p>

  <p>This indicator is connected to many other indicators of the SDGs. It
  ensures that the SDGs integrate the wider dimensions of space, population and
  land adequately, providing the framework for the implementation of other goals
  such as poverty, health, education, energy, inequalities and climate change.
  The indicator has a multipurpose measurement as it is not only related to the
  type/form of the urbanization pattern. It is also used to capture various
  dimensions of land use efficiency: economic (proximity of factors of
  production); environmental (lower per capita rates of resource use and GHG
  emissions); social (reduced travel distance and cost expended). Finally, this
  indicator integrates an important spatial component and is fully in line with
  the recommendations made by the Data Revolution initiative.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The major limitation for this indicator lies in its interpretation. In each
  human settlement structure, there are many factors at play, that make it more
  difficult to generalize the implication of a single LCRPGR value to
  sustainable urbanization. For example, while a value less than 1 could be a
  good indicator of urban compactness and its associated benefits, intra-city
  analysis may reveal high levels of congestion and poor living environments,
  which is against the principles of sustainable development. On the other hand,
  a value of one may not mean an optimal balance between spatial growth of urban
  areas and their populations, since it would imply new developments with every
  unit increase in population. To help explain the values of the indicator, two
  secondary indicators have been proposed, which use the same inputs as the core
  indicator: built up area per capita and total change in built up area. </p>

  <p>Another limitation in the indicator is where zero or negative growth get
  reported, such as where population over the analysis period decreases or a
  natural disaster results in loss of the built-up area mass. Without looking at
  the land consumption and population growth rates separately, it is difficult
  to correctly interpret the indicator and its meaning. To address this, it is
  recommended to understand the individual rates, and also use the proposed
  secondary indicators to explain the trends. </p>

  <p>Aggregating the indicator values for more than one city may also make the
  interpretation ambiguous. For example, an average value for a country with two
  cities might be between 0 and 1 if both cities are record values within this
  range, or if one has a value above 1 and the other a value below 0. The use of
  the national sample of cities approach, which produces a representative sample
  for each country will help resolve this challenge. </p>

  <p>In some cases, it is difficult to measure the urban expansion by
  conurbations of two or more urban areas that are in close proximity; to whom
  to attribute the urban growth and how to include it as one metric usually
  becomes a challenge. At the same time, data would not always coincide to
  administrative levels, boundaries and built-up areas. To resolve this, the use
  of a harmonized approach to defining urban areas and cities has been
  identified as helping to resolve this challenge.</p>

  <p>In the absence of the GIS layers, this indicator may not be computed as
  defined. As a result, more alternative measures for land that is developed or
  consumed per year can be adequately used. Alternatively, one can monitor the
  efficient use of urban land by measuring how well we are achieving the
  densities in residential zones that any city plans or international guidance
  call for. Comparing achieved to planned densities is very useful at the city
  level. However, planned densities vary greatly from country to country, and at
  times from city to city. At the sub-regional or city levels, it is more
  appropriate to compare average densities achieved currently to those achieved
  in the recent past. While building more densely does use land more
  efficiently, high density neighborhoods, especially in and around urban
  centers, have a number of other advantages. They support more frequent public
  transportation, and more local stores and shops; they encourage pedestrian
  activity to and from local establishments; and they create lively (and
  sometimes safer) street life.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The method to compute ratio of land consumption rate to population growth
  rate follows five broad steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Deciding on the analysis period/years</li>
    <li>Delimitation of the urban area or city which will act as the geographical scope for the analysis</li>
    <li>Spatial analysis and computation of the land consumption rate</li>
    <li>Spatial analysis and computation of the population growth rate</li>
    <li>Computation of the ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate</li>
    <li>Computation of recommended secondary indicators</li>
    <li><strong>Deciding on the analysis period/years</strong></li>
  </ol>

  <p>This step involves selecting the time period during which the measurement
  of the indicator will be undertaken. Since this indicator considers historical
  growth of urban areas, analysis can be done annually, in 5-year cycles or
  10-year cycles. Cycles of 5 or 10 years are commended, especially where use of
  mid-to-high resolution satellite imagery is used to extract data on built up
  areas, which is used to compute the land consumption rate component of the
  indicator. UN-Habitat and partners have been creating a repository of some
  data on this indicator using 1990 as the baseline year. Countries can however
  compute the indicator as far as back as satellite imagery is available (1975
  for Landsat free imagery) and can maintain the current/most recent year as the
  final reporting year. </p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Delimitation of the urban area or city which will act as the spatial analysis scope</strong></li>
  </ol>

  <p>Urban areas and cities grow in different ways, the most common of which
  include infill (new developments within existing urban areas resulting in
  densification), extension (new developments at the edge of existing urban
  areas), leapfrogging (new urban threshold developments which are not attached
  to the urban area but which are functionally linked) and inclusion (engulfing
  of outlying urban clusters or leapfrog developments into the urban area, often
  forming urban conurbations). Key to note also is that growth of urban areas is
  not always positive. Sometimes, negative growth can be recorded, such as where
  disasters (e.gs floods, earthquakes) result in collapse of buildings and/or
  reduction in the built-up area mass. </p>

  <p>Understanding the spatial growth of urban areas requires two important
  pre-requisites: a) delimitation of an appropriate spatial analysis scope which
  captures the entire urban fabric (as opposed to just the administratively
  defined boundaries), and b) use of a growth tracking measurement that helps
  understand when both positive and negative growth happen. For the former, a
  harmonized urban area/city definition approach which allows for consistent
  analysis is recommended, while the use of built up areas is recommended for
  the latter since it allows for measurement of both positive and negative urban
  growth. </p>

  <p>Following consultations with 86 member states, the United Nations
  Statistical Commission in its 51<sup>st</sup> Session (March 2020) endorsed
  the Degree of Urbanisation (DEGURBA) as a workable method to delineate cities,
  urban and rural areas for international statistical comparisons. Countries are
  thus encouraged to adopt this approach, which will help them produce data that
  is comparable across urban areas within their territories, as well as with
  urban areas and cities in other countries. More details on DEGURBA are
  available here: <a
  href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/51st-session/documents/BG-Item3j-Recommendation-E.pdf">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/51st-session/documents/BG-Item3j-Recommendation-E.pdf</a></p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Spatial analysis and computation of the land consumption rate</strong></li>
  </ol>

  <p>Using the urban boundaries defined in step (b), spatial analysis is
  undertaken to determine the land consumption rate. To implement this, the
  three steps below are followed:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>From satellite imagery, extract data on built up areas for each analysis year </li>
    <li>Calculate the total area covered by the built-up areas for each of the analysis years </li>
    <li>Compute the (annual) land consumption rate using the formula:</li>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Spatial analysis and computation of the population growth rate</strong></li>
  </ol>

  <p>Using the urban boundaries defined in step (b), calculate the total
  population within the urban area in each of the analysis years where the land
  consumption rate is computed. Population data collected by National
  Statistical Offices through censuses and other surveys should be used for this
  analysis. Where this type of population data is not available, or where data
  is released at large population units which exceed the defined urban area,
  countries are encouraged to create population grids, which can help
  disaggregate the data from large and different sized census/ population data
  release units to smaller uniform sized grids. </p>

  <p>The (annual) population growth rate is calculated using the total
  population within the urban area for the analysis period using the formula

  <p>The analysis years for both the land consumption rate and the population
  growth rate should be the same. </p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Computation of recommended secondary indicators</strong></li>
  </ol>

  <p>There are two important secondary indicators which help interpret the value
  of the main indicator - LGRPGR, thus helping in better understanding the
  nature of urban growth in each urban area. Both indicators use the same input
  data as the LCRPGR and will thus not require additional work by countries.
  These are: </p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Built-up area per capita</strong> &#x2013; which is a measure of the average amount of built-up area available to each person in an urban area during each analysis year. This indicator can help identify when urban areas become too dense and/or when they become too sparsely populated. It is computed by dividing the total built-up area by the total urban population within the urban area/city at a given year, using the formula below:</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Detailed steps for computation of the core indicator and the secondary
  indicators are available in the detailed training module for indicator 11.3.1:
  <a

  </p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>As part of the validation process, UN-Habitat developed a template to
  compile data generated by countries through the National Statistics Offices as
  well as other government agencies responsible for official statistics (see:
  https://data.unhabitat.org/datasets/template-for-compilation-of-sdg-indicator-11-3-1).
  Data compiled is then checked against several criteria including the data
  sources used, the application of internationally agreed definitions,
  classification and methodologies to the data from that source, etc. Once
  reviewed, appropriate feedback is then provided to individual countries for
  further discussion. </p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>Any adjustments to the data is jointly agreed after consultations with the
  relevant national agencies that share the data points for reporting.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p>&#x2022; At country level</p>

  <p>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</p>

  <p>All countries are expected to fully report on this indicator more
  consistently starting in 2020 with few challenges where missing values will be
  reported due to missing base map files. Only limited cases of missing values
  are anticipated, which can emanate from situations where population growth
  figures are unavailable or where land consumption rates are inestimable due to
  lack or poor quality of multi-temporal coverage of satellite imagery. Because
  the values will be aggregated at the national levels from a national sample of
  cities, missing values will be less observed at national and global levels</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Data at the global/regional levels will be estimated from national figures
  derived from national sample of cities. Regional estimates will incorporate
  national representations using a weighting by population sizes. Global
  monitoring will be led by UN-Habitat with the support of other partners and
  regional commissions.</p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>Data for indicator 11.3.1 is to be collected at the city/urban level and
  aggregates made to the national level. For countries which have adequate
  capacity (personnel, systems, resources) and baseline data, the indicator can
  be computed for all cities/urban areas then averages used to report on
  national performances. For countries which do not have the capacity to collect
  data and undertake computations for all their cities/urban areas, UN-Habitat
  has proposed the use of the National Sample of Cities Approach, which allows
  them to select a representative sample from where weighted national aggregates
  can be undertaken. </p>

  <p>The guidance on implementation of the National Sample of Cities Approach is
  available here: <a
  href="https://unhabitat.org/sites/default/files/2020/06/national_sample_of_cities_english.pdf">https://unhabitat.org/sites/default/files/2020/06/national_sample_of_cities_english.pdf</a></p>

  <p>UN-Habitat will continuously undertake capacity building on the sampling
  approach, and directly support countries to develop a national sample of
  cities where needed. </p>
QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>To ensure consistency in data production across countries, UN-Habitat has
  developed detailed step-by-step tutorials on the computation of indicator
  11.3.1, which further explain the steps presented in this metadata. The
  detailed tutorials, which will be continuously updated are available at <a
  href="https://unhabitat.org/knowledge/data-and-analytics">https://unhabitat.org/knowledge/data-and-analytics</a>,
  <a
  href="https://www.urbanagendaplatform.org/learning">https://www.urbanagendaplatform.org/learning</a>,
  and <a href="https://data.unhabitat.org/">https://data.unhabitat.org/</a>.
  </p>

  <p>Within its Data and Analytics Section which is responsible for the
  indicator data compilation, UN-Habitat has a team of spatial data experts who
  check all submitted data and provide direct support to countries in the
  indicator computation. </p>

  <p>As part of its global custodianship of indicator 11.3.1, UN-Habitat has
  also established partnerships with major institutions and organizations
  involved in production of baseline data relevant for the indicator
  computation. The main aim of this is to create a common understanding on the
  approach for the indicator computation, and to encourage continuous production
  of high-quality global data that responds to the indicator computation needs.
  Examples of some ongoing initiatives with partners to manage quality of
  products and processes include, among others providing support to apply the
  Degree of Urbanisation at the local level for the indicator computation (in
  partnership with the European Commission), development of an Earth Observation
  Toolkit for SDG 11 (in partnership with EO4SDG and GEO), and continuous
  feedback to global products produced by partners such as the German Aerospace
  Center (DLR) and the European Commission Joint Research Centre (EC-JRC) among
  others. </p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>UN-Habitat maintains the global urban indicators database that is used for
  monitoring of the urban metrics drawn from SDGs, NUA, flagship reports (e.g.
  World Cities Report) and other official reporting. In general, for all new
  data, a thorough review is done to check for consistency and overall data
  quality by technical staff in the Data and Analytics unit before publication
  in the urban indicators database. This ensures that only the most accurate and
  reliable information are included in the database. Key elements considered in
  the review include: proper documentation of data sources; representativeness
  of data at national level, use of appropriate methodology for data collection
  and analysis (e.g. appropriate sampling process, values based on valid sample
  sizes), use of appropriate concepts and definitions, consistency of data
  trends with previously published/reported estimates for the indicator.</p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>Once data is received from member states, UN-Habitat uses a checklist
  specific to each indicator to assess a) whether the data production process
  followed the metadata provisions, and b) confirm the accuracy of the data
  sources used for the indicator computation. Both components are captured in
  the reporting template shared with National Statistical Offices, which helps
  to assess whether computation was done using the proposed indicator inputs or
  proxies. The reporting template also requests for information that helps
  understand whether national data for the indicator was produced from a
  representative sample of the country&#x2019;s urban systems, or if estimates
  were done for only select cities/urban areas where data is easily available.
  </p>

  <p>In addition, the received data is also checked for other qualities such as
  data disaggregation, reporting period and consistency with other previously
  reported trends, which ensures reliable regional estimates. For indicator
  11.3.1, one extra assessment that is done is to compare reported urbanization
  values (at the city/urban level) against visual interpretation of growth
  trends from multi-temporal high resolution Google Earth Imagery and population
  projections from the World Urbanization Prospects. </p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p>Data availability:</p>

  <p>This indicator is categorized under Tier II, meaning the indicator is
  conceptually clear and an established methodology exists but data on many
  countries is not yet available. The indicator&#x2019;s rapid adoption by
  countries since 2015 has resulted in increased production of data at the local
  level, while activities of UN-Habitat and partners in the earth observation
  field are significantly contributing to availability of baseline data for the
  indicator. For example, using global datasets such as the Global Human
  Settlement Layer (GHSL), the World Settlement Footprint (WSF), the Gridded
  Population of the World (GPW), WorldPop dataset, the High Resolution
  Settlement Layer (HRSL) among others can help attain global estimates for the
  indicator. While some of these datasets have limitations in their application
  to track city level trends, their wide coverage provides a useful resource for
  the indicator computation. Higher resolution data is continuously being
  produced by countries, which are supported by organizations working in the
  earth observation and geospatial information field of expertise. More than
  1,500 cities from more than 80 countries have data at the right resolution
  required for the indicator computation.</p>

  <p>Time series:</p>

  <p>Available time series runs at the city and national level for selected
  countries</p>

  <p>Disaggregation:</p>

  <p>Potential Disaggregation:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Disaggregation by location (operational urban area vs administratively defined urban area, urban wide vs intra-urban growth trends)</li>
    <li>Disaggregation by type of growth<strong> </strong>(infill, expansion, leapfrogging)</li>
    <li>Disaggregation by city type (large vs medium sized vs small)</li>
    <li>Disaggregation by type of land use consumed by the urbanization process </li>
  </ul>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>Sources of discrepancies:</p>

  <p>Significant variations between global and national figures are anticipated
  where globally produced built-up layers are used to compute the indicator.
  This is largely due to the uniqueness of some local contexts and variations in
  image reflectance and land cover types, which make it difficult to accurately
  capture built up areas consistently. While the national figures will be used
  for reporting &#x2013; resulting in less differences being observed, some
  countries may opt to use the globally available products, which may create
  some variations as locally generated data becomes available. UN-Habitat will
  be responsible for checking all figures to ensure that no inconsistencies are
  reported. </p>

  <p>The second likely source of differences between figures is the approach
  used to define urban areas and cities for the purpose of the indicator
  computation. To resolve this, the use of the degree of urbanization approach
  to definition of urban and rural areas and production of comparable data is
  recommended. This approach was endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission in
  March 2020, and its incremental adoption by countries is likely to reduce any
  differences in the figures reported in future. </p>
