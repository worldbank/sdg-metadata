SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS: >-
  <p>Time-use information collected and analyzed around the world has shown that
  there is a very close link between economic poverty (SDG 1) and time poverty;
  most of health care is provided by households (SDG 3) and these activities are
  socially allocated to women in general; the provision of early childhood
  education services (SDG 4) not only prepares children for primary education
  but also frees up time for their caregivers; the sexual division of labour is
  a structural challenge of gender inequalities (SDG 5, 8 and 10); and the lack
  of services such as drinkable water, electricity or transport infrastructure
  increases unpaid work time and disproportionately affects women (SDG 6, 7,
  9,11). Please see the section &#x201C;Time-use data crucial for monitoring the
  2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: going beyond SDG 5&#x201D; of the

  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>This indicator is defined as the proportion of time spent in a day on
  unpaid domestic and care work by men and women. Unpaid domestic and care work
  refers to activities related to the provision of services for own final use by
  household members, or by family members living in other households. These
  activities are listed in the International Classification of Activities for
  Time-Use Statistics 2016 (ICATUS 2016)<sup><a href="#footnote-3"
  id="footnote-ref-3">[2]</a></sup> under the major divisions &#x201C;3. Unpaid
  domestic services for household and family members&#x201D; and &#x201C;4.
  Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members&#x201D;. </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p><em>Unpaid domestic work </em>refers to activities including food and meals
  management preparation, cleaning and maintaining of own dwelling and
  surroundings, , do-it-yourself decoration, maintenance and repair of personal
  and household goods, care and maintenance of textiles and footwear, household
  management, pet care, shopping for own household and family members and travel
  related to previous listed unpaid domestic services.</p>

  <p>Unpaid care work refers to activities related to childcare and
  instruction,, care of the sick, elderly, or disabled household and family
  members, and travel related to these unpaid caregiving services.. </p>

  <p>Concepts and definitions for this indicator are based on the following
  international standards:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>International Classification of Activities for Time Use Statistics 2016 (ICATUS 2016)</li>
    <li>System of National Accounts 2008 (SNA 2008)</li>
    <li>The Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment, and labour underutilization, adopted by the International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) at its 19th Session in 2013</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As much as possible, statistics compiled by UNSD are based on the
  International Classification of Activities for Time Use Statistics 2016
  (ICATUS 2016), which classifies activities undertaken by persons during the
  survey period. ICATUS 2016 was adopted by the United Nations Statistical
  Commission for use as an international statistical classification at its 48th
  session, 7-10 March 2017.</p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup

SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Most data on time use are collected through dedicated time use surveys or
  from time-use modules integrated into multi-purpose household surveys,
  conducted at the national level.</p>

  <p>Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or
  a stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on
  what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity
  followed and the time that activity began and ended (in most of the cases
  based on fixed intervals), and so forth through the 24 hours of the day.
  Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they
  allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or a
  week.</p>

  <p>Data are collected by national statistical offices, the official
  counterparts at the country level. Data are compiled and validated by UNSD. If
  there are inconsistencies or issues with the data, UNSD consults the focal
  point in the national statistical office. The data for SDG 5.4.1 is, as much
  as possible, in line with relevant international standards, or properly
  footnoted. International standards include:</p>

  <p>The Global Gender Statistics Programme is mandated by the United Nations
  Statistical Commission, implemented by the United Nations Statistics Division
  (UNSD, and coordinated by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Gender
  Statistics (IAEG-GS).</p>

  <p>The Programme encompasses:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>improving coherence among existing initiatives on gender statistics through international coordination</li>
    <li>developing and promoting methodological guidelines in existing domains as well as in emerging areas of gender concern</li>
    <li>strengthening national statistical and technical capacity for the production, dissemination, and use of gender-relevant data</li>
    <li>facilitating access to gender-relevant data and metadata through a gender data portal<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4">[3]</a></sup>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>UNSD serves as the Secretariat of the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on
  Gender Statistics (IAEG-GS), the coordinating, and guiding body of the Global
  Gender Statistics Programme. The IAEG-GS was first convened in 2006, meets
  annually and functions through advisory groups. Presently, the main advisory
  group&apos;s work concentrates on examining emerging and unaddressed key
  gender issues and related data gaps with the aim to develop proposals on how
  to fill these gaps.</p>

  <p>In addition, UNSD serves as Secretariat of the United Nations Expert Group
  on Innovative and Effective Ways to Collect Time-Use Statistics (EG-TUS),
  which initiated its work in June 2018 with the overall objective of taking
  stock and reviewing country practices in time-use surveys and providing
  technical guidance and recommendations to improve the collection and use of
  time use data, in line with international standards and in support of SDGs
  implementation. In particular, the Group was established to develop

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The purpose of the indicator is to measure the amount of time women and men
  spend doing unpaid work, to ensure that all work, whether paid or unpaid, is
  valued. In addition, it also provides an assessment of gender equality, by
  highlighting discrepancies between how much time women and men spend on unpaid
  work, like cooking, cleaning, or taking care of children.</p>

  <p>This indicator measures the average amount of time as a proportion in a
  day, so that if for a given country it is reported that women aged 15+ spend
  10% of their day on unpaid domestic chores while men in the same age group
  spend 1%, it indicates that women spend 2.4 hours (2 hours and 24 minutes),
  while men spend 14.4 minutes on it a day, on average. As explained further in
  4.c, this daily average is obtained from an average taken over the reference
  period for the data collection, and thus not mean that women and men spend
  these given amounts of time every single day. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Time use statistics have been used: (1) to provide a measure of the quality
  of life or general well-being of individuals and households; (2) to offer a
  more comprehensive measurement of all forms of work, including unpaid
  household service work; (3) to produce data relevant for monitoring gender
  equality and the empowerment of women and girls and are essential inputs for
  the policy and political dialogue on gender equality.</p>

  <p>International comparability of time-use statistics is limited by several
  factors, including: </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Diary versus stylized time-use survey. Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or a stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, the time that activity began and ended, and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or week. Data obtained from these two different data collection methods are usually not comparable, and even data collected with different stylized questions might not be comparable given that the level of detail asked about activities performed might differ from one instrument to another, thus impacting the total time spent on a given activity. </li>
    <li>Time-use activity classification. Regional and national classifications of time-use activities may differ from the The International Classification of Activities for Time Use Statistics 2016 (ICATUS 2016), resulting in data that are not comparable across countries. </li>
    <li>Time-use data presented refer to the &#x201C;main activity&#x201D; only. Any &#x201C;secondary activity&#x201D; performed simultaneously with the main activity is not reflected in the average times shown. For instance, a woman may be cooking and looking after a child simultaneously. For countries reporting cooking as the main activity, time spent caring for children is not accounted for and reflected in the statistics. This may affect the international comparability of data on time spent caring for children; it may also underestimate the time women spend on this activity. </li>
    <li>Different target age populations used by countries and age groups used also make time use data difficult to compare across countries.</li>
  </ol>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Data presented for this indicator are expressed as a proportion of time in
  a day. In the case when the reference period is one week, weekly data is
  averaged over seven days of the week to obtain the daily average time. </p>

  <p>Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work is calculated by
  dividing the daily average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and care
  work by 24 hours. </p>

  <p>If data on time spent are weekly, data are averaged over seven days of the
  week to obtain daily time spent.</p>

  <p>Average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and care work derives from
  time-use statistics that are collected through stand-alone time-use surveys or
  a time-use module in multi-purpose household surveys. Data on time-use may be
  summarized and presented as either (1) average time spent for participants (in
  each activity) only or (2) average time spent for all populations of a certain
  age (total relevant population). In the former type of average, the total time
  spent by the individuals who performed the activity is divided by the number
  of persons who performed it (participants). In the latter type of averages,
  the total time is divided by the total relevant population (or a sub-group
  thereof), regardless of whether people performed the activity or not. </p>

  <p><em>SDG indicator 5.4.1 is calculated based on the average number of hours
  spent on unpaid domestic and unpaid care work for the total relevant
  population. This type of measure can be used to compare groups and assess
  changes over time. Differences among groups or over time may be due to a
  difference (or change) in the proportion of those participating in the
  specific activity or a difference (or change) in the amount of time spent by
  participants, or both. </em></p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>Most of the data are provided and validated by national statistical
  offices. In some cases, data have been obtained from publicly available
  national databases and publications. The United Nations Statistics Division
  (UNSD) communicates with countries if there are inconsistencies or possible
  errors in the data.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: <p>No adjustments concerning international standards are made.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <ul>
    <li><strong>At country level</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>UNSD does not produce estimates for missing values</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>At regional and global levels</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>No imputation is done. Aggregates are computed based on available data
  only.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>The number of countries conducting such surveys is insufficient to allow
  the computation of annual regional aggregates for SDG reporting. Furthermore,
  limited comparability across national data hampers the computation of regional
  aggregates. Nevertheless, UNSD regularly produces regional estimates to
  monitor and report on global trends. This is done by using the latest
  available data from each country in the region. In the case of insufficient
  data from a region, regional aggregates are not reported for the region. The
  SDG regions of &#x201C;Australia and New Zealand&#x201D; and &#x201C;Europe
  and North America&#x201D; are combined to produce a single aggregate for
  &#x201C;Developed region.&#x201D; In addition, the ratio of time spent by
  women and men are computed separately for each country and then averaged over
  the countries in the region to ensure comparability. </p>

QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>The United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) has been reviewing in detail
  the survey methodology followed to collect time use data and the
  classification of activities used by countries, to assess the level of
  comparability across countries and over time in each country.</p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>UNSD reviews and assesses the quality of the data received from countries
  and reverts to the data providers for clarifications if needed. The data
  received are compared to previous years to ensure consistency over time. In
  addition, the indicator calculations are verified, and data are checked for
  anomalies.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>92 countries with data between 2000 and 2022</p>

  <p>By Year:</p>

  <p>From 2000 &#x2013; 2004: 41 countries</p>

  <p>From 2005 &#x2013; 2009: 38 countries</p>

  <p>From 2010 - 2019: 66 countries</p>

  <p>From 2020: 4 countries</p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>From 2000 to 2022</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>This indicator should be disaggregated by the following dimensions: sex,
  age, and location.</p>

  <p>The categories for disaggregation, by dimension, are as follows: </p>

  <p>Sex: female/male.</p>

  <p>Age: the recommended age groups are 15+, 15-24, 25-44, 45-54, 55-64 and
  65+</p>

  <p>Location: urban/rural (following national definitions given the lack of
  international definition).</p>

  <p>These categories have been recommended by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group
  on Gender Statistics (IAEG-GS) during its 11th meeting in Rome, Italy on 30-31
  October 2017.</p>

  <p>Available data are currently disaggregated by sex, age, and location</p>
