  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> </p>

  <p>Incidence of malaria is defined as the number of new cases of malaria per
  1,000 people at risk each year. </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong> </p>

  <p>Case of malaria is defined as the occurrence of malaria infection in a
  person whom the presence of malaria parasites in the blood has been confirmed
  by a diagnostic test. The population considered is the population at risk of
  the disease. </p>
UNIT_MEASURE: <p>Cases per 1000 population at risk. </p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: <p>N.A.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Cases reported by the NMCP are obtained from each country surveillance
  system. This include among others information on the number of suspected
  cases, number of tested cases, number of positive cases by method of detection
  and by species as well as number of health facilities that report those cases.
  This information is summarized in a DHIS2 application developed for this
  purpose. Data for representative household surveys are publicly available and
  included National Demographic Household Surveys (DHS) or Malaria Indicator
  Survey (MIS). </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The official counterpart for each country is the National Malaria Control
  Program at the Ministry of Health. </p>
FREQ_COLL: <p>Data is collected every year. </p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: <p>Data is released yearly. </p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>The National Malaria Control Program is the responsible to collect the
  information at each country. </p>
COMPILING_ORG: >-
  <p>The Surveillance, Monitoring and Evaluation Unit of the Global Malaria
  Control Programme is the responsible to compile and process all the relevant
  information. National estimates for some countries are estimated in
  collaboration with the Oxford University (Malaria Atlas Project). </p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The Global technical strategy and targets for malaria 2016&#x2013;2030 was
  adopted by the The 68 World Health Assembly (<a
  href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/253469/A68_R1_REC1-en.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/253469/A68_R1_REC1-en.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y</a>).
  The Assembly requested WHO to monitor the progress toward the GTS milestones
  and targets. The World Malaria Report is the process by which the GTS is
  monitored by country, WHO region and globally. </p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>To measure trends in malaria morbidity and to identify locations where the
  risk of disease is highest. With this information, programmes can respond to
  unusual trends, such as epidemics, and direct resources to the populations
  most in need. This data also serves to inform global resource allocation for
  malaria such as when defining eligibility criteria for Global Fund finance.
  </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The estimated incidence can differ from the incidence reported by a
  Ministry of Health which can be affected by: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>the completeness of reporting: the number of reported cases can be lower than the estimated cases if the percentage of health facilities reporting in a month is less than 100% </li>
    <li>the extent of malaria diagnostic testing (the number of slides examined or RDTs performed) </li>
    <li>the use of private health facilities which are usually not included in reporting systems. </li>
    <li>the indicator is estimated only where malaria transmission occurs. </li>
  </ul>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Malaria incidence (1) is expressed as the number of new cases per 100,000
  population per year with the population of a country derived from projections
  made by the UN Population Division and the total proportion at risk estimated
  by a country&#x2019;s National Malaria Control Programme. More specifically,
  the country estimates what is the total proportion of the population at risk
  of malaria and then, for each year, the total population at risk is estimated
  as the UN Population for that year, times the proportion of the population at
  risk at baseline.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>The total number of new cases, T, is estimated from the number of malaria
  cases reported by a Ministry of Health which is adjusted to take into account
  (i) incompleteness in reporting systems (ii) patients seeking treatment in the
  private sector, self-medicating or not seeking treatment at all, and (iii)
  potential over-diagnosis through the lack of laboratory confirmation of cases.
  The procedure, which is described in the <em>World malaria report 2009</em>
  (2), combines data reported by NMCPs (reported cases, reporting completeness
  and likelihood that cases are parasite positive) with data obtained from
  nationally representative household surveys on health-service use. Briefly,
  </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>T=(a+(c &#xD7; e)/d)&#xD7;(1+h/g+((1&#x2212;g&#x2212;h)/2)/g)</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>where: <br>a is the number of malaria cases confirmed in public sector
  <br>b is the number of suspected cases tested <br>c is the number of presumed
  cases (not tested but treated as malaria) <br><em>d </em>is the reporting
  completeness <br><em>e </em>is the test positivity rate (malaria positive
  fraction) = a/b <br><em>f </em>is the estimated cases in public sector,
  calculated by (a + (c x <em>e</em>))/<em>d</em> <br><em>g </em>is the fraction
  seeking treatment in public sector <br><em>h </em>is the fraction seeking
  treatment in private sector <br><em>i </em>is the fraction not seeking
  treatment, calculated by (1-<em>g</em>-<em>h</em>)/2 <br><em>j </em>is the
  cases in private sector, calculated as <em>f x h/g</em> <br><em>k </em>is the
  cases not in private and not in public, calculated by <em>f </em>x
  <em>i</em>/<em>g</em> <br><em>T </em>is total cases, calculated by <em>f
  </em>+ <em>j </em>+ <em>k</em>. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>To estimate the uncertainty around the number of cases, the test positivity
  rate was assumed to have a normal distribution centred on the <em>Test
  positivity rate</em> value and standard deviation defined as </p>

  <p>0.244 &#xD7; Test positivity rate<sup>0.5547</sup></p>

  <p> and truncated to be in the range 0, 1. Reporting completeness was assumed
  to have one of three distributions, depending on the range or value reported
  by the NMCP. If the range was greater than 80% the distribution was assumed to
  be triangular, with limits of 0.8 and 1 and the peak at 0.8. If the range was
  greater than 50% then the distribution was assumed to be rectangular, with
  limits of 0.5 and 0.8. Finally, if the range was lower than 50% the
  distribution was assumed to be triangular, with limits of 0 and 0.5 and the
  peak at 0.5 (3) . If the reporting completeness was reported as a value and
  was greater than 80%, a beta distribution was assumed with a mean value of the
  reported value (maximum of 95%) and confidence intervals (CIs) of 5% round the
  mean value. The proportions of children for whom care was sought in the
  private sector and in the public sector were assumed to have a beta
  distribution, with the mean value being the estimated value in the survey and
  the standard deviation calculated from the range of the estimated 95%
  confidence intervals (CI) divided by 4. The proportion of children for whom
  care was not sought was assumed to have a rectangular distribution, with the
  lower limit 0 and upper limit calculated as 1 minus the proportion that sought
  care in public or private sector. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Values for the proportion seeking care were linearly interpolated between
  the years that have a survey, and were extrapolated for the years before the
  first or after the last survey. Missing values for the distributions were
  imputed using a mixture of the distribution of the country, with equal
  probability for the years where values were present or, if there was no value
  at all for any year in the country, a mixture of the distribution of the
  region for that year. The data were analysed using the R statistical software
  (4). Confidence intervals were obtained from 10000 drawns of the convoluted
  distributions. (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bolivia (Plurinational State of),
  Botswana, Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Eritrea, Ethiopia,
  French Guiana, Gambia, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, India, Indonesia,
  Lao People&#x2019;s Democratic Republic, Madagascar, Mauritania, Myanmar,
  Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru,
  Philippines, Rwanda, Senegal, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Vanuatu, Venezuela
  (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam, Yemen and Zimbabwe. For India, the values
  were obtained at subnational level using the same methodology, but adjusting
  the private sector for an additional factor due to the active case detection,
  estimated as the ratio of the test positivity rate in the active case
  detection over the test positivity rate for the passive case detection. This
  factor was assumed to have a normal distribution, with mean value and standard
  deviation calculated from the values reported in 2010. Bangladesh, Bolivia
  (plurinational State of), Botswana, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic,
  French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Myanmar (since 2013),
  Rwanda, and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) report cases from the private
  and public sector together; therefore, no adjustment for private sector
  seeking treatment was made while for Indonesia, 25% of the private was assume
  to be reported in the public sector since 2017. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>For some high-transmission African countries the quality of case reporting
  is considered insufficient for the above formulae to be applied. In such cases
  estimates of the number of malaria cases are derived from information on
  parasite prevalence obtained from household surveys. First, data on parasite
  prevalence from nearly 60 000 survey records were assembled within a
  spatiotemporal Bayesian geostatistical model, along with environmental and
  sociodemographic covariates, and data distribution on interventions such as
  ITNs, antimalarial drugs and IRS. The geospatial model enabled predictions of
  Plasmodium falciparum prevalence in children aged 2&#x2013;10 years, at a
  resolution of 5 &#xD7; 5 km2, throughout all malaria endemic African countries
  for each year from 2000 to 2016 (see <a
  href="http://www.map.ox.ac.uk/making-maps/"
  target="_blank"><u>http://www.map.ox.ac.uk/making-maps/</u></a> for methods on
  the development of maps by the Malaria Atlas Project). Second, an ensemble
  model was developed to predict malaria incidence as a function of parasite
  prevalence. The model was then applied to the estimated parasite prevalence in
  order to obtain estimates of the malaria case incidence at 5 &#xD7; 5
  km<sup>2</sup> resolution for each year from 2000 to 2016. Data for each 5
  &#xD7; 5 km<sup>2</sup> area were then aggregated within country and regional
  boundaries to obtain both national and regional estimates of malaria cases
  (5). (Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African
  Republic, Chad, Congo, C&#xF4;te d&apos;Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the
  Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia,
  Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan,
  Sudan, Togo, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia) </p>

  <p>For most of the elimination or near elimination countries, the number of
  indigenous cases registered by the NMCPs are reported without further
  adjustments. (Algeria, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belize, Bhutan, Cabo
  Verde, China, Comoros, Costa Rica, Democratic People&#x2019;s Republic of
  Korea, Djibouti, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Eswatini, Georgia, Iran (Islamic
  Republic of), Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Oman,
  Paraguay, Republic of Korea, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, South
  Africa, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, Turkey,
  Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan). </p>

  </ul>

  <p>For missing values of the parameters (test positivity rate and reporting
  completeness) a distribution based on a mixture of the distribution of the
  available values is used, if any value exists for the country or from the
  region otherwise. Values for health seeking behaviour parameters are imputed
  by linear interpolation of the values when the surveys where made or
  extrapolation of the first or last survey. When no reported data is available
  the number of cases is interpolated taking into account the population growth.
