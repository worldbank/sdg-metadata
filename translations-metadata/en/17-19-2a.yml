  <h2>Definition:</h2>

  <p>This information only refers to 17.19.2 (a) </p>

  <p>The indicator tracks the proportion of countries that have conducted at
  least one population and housing census in the last 10 years. This also
  includes countries which compile their detailed population and housing
  statistics from population registers, administrative records, sample surveys
  or other sources or a combination of those sources.</p>

  <h1>Data sources</h1>

  <p>ECOSOC resolution E/RES/2015/10 establishing the 2020 World Population and
  Housing Census Programme requests the Secretary-General to &quot;monitor and
  regularly report to the Statistical Commission on the implementation of the
  Programme&quot;. In response to this request UNSD regularly monitors the
  progress of implementation of population and housing censuses across Member
  States. UNSD sends a survey to all countries soliciting detailed metadata on
  census methods at three points (beginning, mid, end) over the 10-year spanning
  a census decade (currently the 2020 census round covering the years
  2015-2024). In addition, information is also collected through the annual
  questionnaires sent to countries as part of the UN Demographic Yearbook
  collection.</p>

  <h2>Rationale:</h2>

  <p>Population and housing censuses are one of the primary sources of data
  needed for formulating, implementing and monitoring policies and programmes
  aimed at inclusive socioeconomic development and environmental sustainability.
  Population and housing censuses are an important source for supplying
  disaggregated data needed for the measurement of progress of the 2030 Agenda
  for Sustainable Development, especially in the context of assessing the
  situation of people by income, sex, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status,
  disability and geographic location, or other characteristics.</p>

  <p>In recognition of the above, the ECOSOC resolution E/RES/2015/10
  establishing the 2020 World Population and Housing Census Programme urges
  Member States to conduct at least one population and housing census during the
  period from 2015 to 2024, taking into account international and regional
  recommendations relating to population and housing censuses and giving
  particular attention to advance planning, cost efficiency, coverage and the
  timely dissemination of, and easy access to, census results for national
  stakeholders, the United Nations and other appropriate intergovernmental
  organizations in order to inform decisions and facilitate the effective
  implementation of development plans and programmes.</p>

  <p>The indicator tracks the proportion of countries that have conducted at
  least one population and housing census in the last 10 years and hence
  provides information on the availability of disaggregated population and
  housing data needed for the measurement of progress of the 2030 Agenda for
  Sustainable Development.</p>
