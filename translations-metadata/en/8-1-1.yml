COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>Each year, the national accounts section of the UNSD sends a pre-filled NAQ
  to countries or areas to collect the latest data on official annual national
  accounts in domestic currency. In order to lighten the reporting burden of
  countries to different international and regional organizations, the UNSD
  receives data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
  (OECD), the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) and the
  Caribbean Community (CARICOM) on behalf of their constituents. </p>

  <p>The National Accounts Section of the United Nations Statistics
  Division:</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Contributes to the international coordinated development and updating of
  the System of National Accounts (SNA); and undertakes methodological research
  on issues on the research agenda of the SNA in collaboration with the
  Intersecretariat Working Group on National Accounts (ISWGNA).</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Supports the implementation programme of the SNA by developing and updating
  supporting normative standards, training material and compilation guidance for
  the implementation of national accounts and supporting economic statistics and
  maintaining a knowledge base on economic statistics.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Delivers a statistical capacity building programme for the implementation
  of the 2008 SNA and supporting statistics through a series of regional and
  interregional workshops and seminars in collaboration with the regional
  commissions and regional agencies and through a limited number of individual
  country technical assistance missions.</p>

  <p>Collects and disseminates annual national accounts statistics from

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is a proxy for the average
  standard of living of residents in</p>

  <p>a country or area.</p>

  <p>A positive percentage change in annual real GDP per capita can be
  interpreted as an increase in the average standard of living of the residents
  in a country or area.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Although countries or areas calculate GDP using the common principles and
  recommendations in the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA), there
  are still problems in international comparability of GDP estimates. These
  include:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Different versions of the SNA (for example, 1968, 1993 or 2008) countries or areas use in calculating their GDP estimates.</li>
    <li>Different degree of coverage of informal and non-observed economic activities in the GDP estimates.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Further, as a necessary condition to being a key economic performance
  indicator of sustainable development, one of the often-cited limitations of
  GDP is that it does not account for the social and environmental costs of
  production. It is designed as a measure of the level of overall well-being.
  For example, growth in real GDP per capita reveals nothing concerning energy
  and material interactions with the environment.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The annual growth rate of real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is
  calculated as follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Convert annual real GDP in domestic currency at 2015 prices for a country or area to US dollars at 2015 prices using the 2015 exchange rates.</li>
    <li>Divide the result by the population of the country or area to obtain annual real GDP per capita in constant US dollars at 2015 prices.</li>

DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>The official national accounts data in domestic currency are validated to
  check for errors. The validation procedure involves ensuring that aggregates
  are equal to the sum of their components and that data series which are
  provided in multiple tables are represented consistently.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>The current and constant price GDP series are converted into US dollars by
  applying the corresponding market exchange rates as reported by the
  International Monetary Fund (IMF). When these conversion rates are not
  available, other IMF rates are used (official rates or principal rates). For
  countries whose exchange rates are not reported by the IMF, the annual average
  of United Nations operational rates of exchange (UNOPs) is applied. The UNOPs
  are conversion rates that are applied in official transactions of the United
  Nations with these countries. These exchange rates are based on official,
  commercial and/or tourist rates of exchange. </p>

  <p>In cases where a country experiences considerable distortion in the
  conversion rates, the UNSD uses price-adjusted rates of exchange (PARE) as an
  alternative to the exchange rates reported by the IMF or UN operational rates
  of exchange. The conversion based on PARE corrects the distorting effects of
  uneven price changes that are not well reflected in the other conversion
  rates. Consequently, unrealistic levels in GDP and other national accounts
  aggregates expressed in US Dollars may have been adjusted for certain time
  periods to improve the economic analysis at national, regional and local
  levels. </p>

  <p>The constant-price GDP series for each country is then divided by its
  population to obtain its real GDP per capita. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>More information on the methodology to estimate the data is available on <a

  </p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <ul>
    <li><strong>At country level</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>When a full set of official annual GDP data is not available, estimation
  procedures are employed to obtain estimates for the entire time series. When
  full data are not available, a hierarchy of other data sources is used to
  gather information on the national accounts of a country or area. The data
  gathered are then either used directly or estimation procedures are applied to
  obtain the annual GDP data.</p>

  <p>If official data are not available, the selection of data sources is based
  on following hierarchy:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <ol>
        <li>Official publications and websites of national statistical offices, central banks or relevant government ministries;</li>
        <li>Official statistics disseminated by Eurostat, European Central Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for their members;</li>
        <li>Information provided by Permanent Missions to the United Nations;</li>
        <li>Economic surveys and estimates prepared by United Nations&#x2019; Regional Economic Commissions (i.e. UNECE, ECLAC, ESCAP, UNECA and ESCWA);</li>
        <li>Publications of international organizations with a strong focus on statistical data collection (including regional development banks). The most common sources used for their respective countries are listed below: Asia: Asian Development Bank, ASEAN, Arab Monetary Fund, Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) Africa: African Development Bank, Afristat, Banque des &#xC9;tats de l&#x2019;Afrique Centrale (BEAC), Union &#xC9;conomique Mon&#xE9;taire Ouest Africain (UEMOA) Americas: CARICOM, Caribbean Development Bank, Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) Other: OECD for non-member countries Statistical Committee of the Commonwealth of Independent States.</li>
        <li>Estimates and indicators from other international organizations. The most common sources used are: the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank;</li>
        <li>Publications or websites of specialized groups, the most common sources used are: the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Committee of Central Bank Governors in SADC; the Islamic Development Bank, and the Statistical Training Centre for Islamic Countries;</li>
        <li>Economic data from commercial providers and other sources, the most common sources used are: the Economic Intelligence Unit and the United States Central Intelligence Agency;</li>
        <li>Information from neighbouring countries where no alternative source is available (Switzerland for Liechtenstein; France for Monaco; Italy for San Marino; Spain for Andorra; and some Pacific Islands for other Pacific Islands);</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The estimation methods involved in preparing the GDP estimates using
  sources other than official data include trend extrapolation, using
  appropriate indices for inflating or deflating relevant data series, and share
  distribution of GDP. A hierarchical assessment is followed to determine which
  method should be used. Effort is made to keep data estimation methods
  consistent from year to year.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>At regional and global levels</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>After the missing real GDP country or area data are imputed using the
  methods as described above, they are summed up to derive the respective
  regional or global aggregates and then divided by the corresponding population
  data to obtain the regional or global real GDP per capita. After that, annual
  growth rates in regional or global real GDP per capita are calculated using
  the formula described above.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>For each year, the real GDP and population estimates for each country or
  area are summed up to derive the regional and global aggregates. The regional
  and global aggregates are then divided by the corresponding population to
  derive the regional and global real GDP per capita estimates. These estimates
  are then used to calculate the annual growth rates in regional and global real
  GDP per capita using the formula described above.</p>

QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>All official data received by the United Nations Statistics Division are
  checked for errors prior to incorporation in the United Nations official data
  database. The checking involves ensuring that aggregate indicators are equal
  to the sum of their components and that indicators which are provided in
  multiple tables are represented consistently. Footnotes are added to the data
  when necessary.</p>

  <p>Similarly, the estimated data are checked for consistency by ensuring that
  aggregate indicators are equal to the sum of their components and that
  indicators which are represented in multiple tables are represented
  consistently. The estimates derived for each year are compared to previous
  years to ensure that estimates are prepared consistently from year to year.
  Additionally, the growth rate from year to year is analyzed to identify
  anomalies in the data.</p>

  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>National statistics offices, central banks or national agencies responsible
  for compiling official national accounts estimates for a country or area.</p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>Annual data from 1970 to 2021 are available. </p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>It is possible to disaggregate the country data by region, if countries can
  make available the underlying</p>

  <p>regional data which are consistent with the national accounts data to
  perform the disaggregation.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies: </strong></p>

  <p>The differences with country data include the following: </p>

  <p>Official country data are typically available in domestic currency only.
  The data estimates for this indicator are in US dollars. </p>

  <p>Countries or areas may not have a full set of official GDP data. The GDP
  data estimated by UNSD include imputations using various estimation procedures
  as described above to obtain estimates for the entire time series. </p>

  <p>Official country data are often reported as multiple sets of time series
  versions, with each version representing a unique methodology used to compile
  the national accounts data (for example, a difference between two time series
  versions could reflect a change in currency, a switch from 1968 SNA to 1993
  SNA, a change in the office responsible for compiling national accounts,
  etc.). These time series versions may not be comparable, especially when a
  country has shifted from the 1968 SNA to 1993 SNA or 2008 SNA.</p>

  <p>When a single version of a time series does not exist for the entire period
  (1970 to t-1), backcasting procedures are used to link the most recently
  reported time series version with the previous series. Note that if there is a
  change of fiscal year between two official data time series, the older series
  are converted to the fiscal year type of the most recent time series prior to
  backcasting.</p>

  <p>Backcasting procedures are also used when constant price time series
  versions include multiple base years or when constant price time series
  versions are reported as constant prices of the previous year (CPPY). CPPY
  data are backcasted by using the officially reported current price data and
  the officially reported constant price data. The data are backcasted into a
  single series with a fixed base year. </p>

  <p>The population estimates from the United Nations Population Division may be
  different from country-produce estimates as the former include analysis
  carried out to take into account deficiencies such as incompleteness of
  coverage, lack of timeliness and errors in the reporting or coding of the
  basic information and to establish past population trends by resolving the
  inconsistencies affecting the basic data.</p>
