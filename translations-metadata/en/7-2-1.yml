  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The renewable energy share in total final consumption is the percentage of
  final consumption of energy that is derived from renewable resources.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>Renewable energy consumption includes consumption of energy derived from:
  hydro, wind, solar, solid biofuels, liquid biofuels, biogas, geothermal,
  marine and renewable waste. Total final energy consumption is calculated from
  balances as total final consumption minus non-energy use. </p>

  <p>Comments regarding specific renewable energy sources: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Solar energy includes solar PV and solar thermal. </li>
    <li>Liquid biofuels include biogasoline, biodiesels and other liquid biofuels. </li>
    <li>Solid biofuels include fuelwood, animal waste, vegetable waste, black liquor, bagasse and charcoal. </li>
    <li>Renewable waste energy covers energy from renewable municipal waste.</li>

CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>The &#x201C;International Recommendations for Energy Statistics&#x201D;
  (IRES), adopted by the UN Statistical Commission, is the globally recognized
  standard used to develop the energy statistics underlying the calculation of
  the indicator. </p>

  <p>This standard is available at: <a
  href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/methodology/ires">unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/methodology/ires</a>.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Data on renewable energy consumption are available through national energy
  balances compiled based on data collected by the International Energy Agency
  (for around 150 countries) and the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD)
  for all countries. The energy balances make it possible to trace all the
  different sources and uses of energy at the national level. </p>

  <p>Some technical assistance may be needed to improve these statistics,
  particularly in the case of renewable energy sources. Specialized industry
  surveys (e.g. on bioenergy use) or household surveys (in combination with the
  measurement of other indicators) would be feasible approaches to filling in
  data gaps (e.g. for use of firewood, off-grid solar energy).</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The IEA collects energy data at the national level according to harmonised
  international definitions and questionnaires, as described in the UN
  International Recommendations for Energy Statistics (<a
  href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/methodology/ires/">unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/methodology/ires/</a>).</p>

  <p>UNSD also collects energy statistics from countries according to the same
  harmonised methodology.</p>
FREQ_COLL: <p>Data are collected on an annual basis.</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>The IEA World Energy Balances are published in February, April and July
  with progressively broader geographical coverage (publishing full information
  for two calendar years prior and selected information for one year prior). The
  UN Energy Statistics Database is made available towards the end of the
  calendar year with full geographical coverage (publishing information for two
  calendar years prior).</p>

COMPILING_ORG: >-
  <p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) and the United Nations Statistics
  Division (UNSD) </p>

  <p>The IEA and UNSD are the primary compilers of energy statistics across
  countries and develop internationally comparable energy balances based on
  internationally agreed methodologies. Aggregates are based on analysis merging
  of IEA and UNSD data.</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>IEA as one of the custodian agencies responsible for monitoring progress
  towards the SDG 7.2 target, leverage on their national data efforts and add
  value by promoting coherent standards, definitions and methodologies for both
  raw data and the derived indicators with the ultimate goal of producing
  internationally comparable datasets. </p>

  <p>The UNSD mission in the area of energy statistics is to strengthen national
  statistical systems in order to assist countries to produce high quality
  energy statistics and balances. The mission is realized through four
  workstreams: Data collection (since 1950); Development of methodological
  guidelines and standards in energy statistics (e.g., IRES, ESCM); Capacity
  building (to disseminate such methodology and to assist countries to
  strengthen their energy statistical systems); and International cooperation
  and coordination. UNSD was selected as one of the custodians of indicator
  7.2.1 because it collects for all countries the underlying data necessary to
  calculate the indicator. </p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The target &#x201C;By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable
  energy in the global energy mix&#x201D; impacts all three dimensions of
  sustainable development. Renewable energy technologies represent a major
  element in strategies for greening economies everywhere in the world and for
  tackling the critical global problem of climate change. A number of
  definitions of renewable energy exist; what they have in common is
  highlighting as renewable all forms of energy that their consumption does not
  deplete their availability in the future. These include solar, wind, ocean,
  hydropower, geothermal sources, and bioenergy (in the case of bioenergy, which
  can be depleted, sources of bioenergy can be replaced within a short to
  medium-term frame). Importantly, this indicator focuses on the amount of
  renewable energy actually consumed rather than the capacity for renewable
  energy production, which cannot always be fully utilized. By focusing on
  consumption by the end user, it avoids the distortions caused by the fact that
  conventional energy sources are subject to significant energy losses along the
  production chain.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: |-
  <ul>
    <li>A limitation with existing renewable energy statistics is that they are not able to distinguish whether renewable energy is being sustainably produced. For example, a substantial share of today&#x2019;s renewable energy consumption comes from the use of wood and charcoal by households in the developing world, which sometimes may be associated with unsustainable forestry practices. There are efforts underway to improve the ability to measure the sustainability of bio-energy, although this remains a significant challenge. </li>
    <li>Off-grid renewables data are limited and not sufficiently captured in national and international energy statistics. </li>
    <li>The method of allocation of renewable energy consumption from electricity and heat output assumes that the share of transmission and distribution losses are the same among all technologies. However, this is not always true; for example when renewables are usually located in more remote areas and may incur larger losses. </li>
    <li>Likewise, imports and exports of electricity and heat are assumed to follow the renewable share of electricity and heat generation, respectively. This is a simplification that in many cases will not affect the indicator too much, but that might do so in some cases, for example, when a country only generates electricity from fossil fuels but imports a great share of the electricity it uses from a neighboring country&#x2019;s hydroelectric power plant. </li>
    <li>Methodological challenges associated with defining and measuring renewable energy are more fully described in the Global Tracking Framework (IEA and World Bank, 2013) Chapter 4, Section 1, pages 194-200. Data for traditional use of solid biofuels are generally scarce globally, and developing capacity in tracking such energy use, including developing national-level surveys, is essential for sound global energy tracking.</li>
  </ul>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>This indicator is based on the development of comprehensive energy
  statistics across supply and demand for all energy sources &#x2013; statistics
  used to produce the energy balance. Internationally agreed methodologies for
  energy statistics are described in the &#x201C;International Recommendations
  for Energy Statistics&#x201D; (IRES), adopted by the UN Statistical
  Commission, available at: <a
  href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/methodology/ires">unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/methodology/ires</a>.</p>

  <p>Once an energy balance is developed, the indicator can be calculated by
  dividing final energy consumption from all renewable sources by total final
  energy consumption. Renewable energy consumption is derived as the sum of
  direct final consumption of renewable sources plus the components of
  electricity and heat consumption estimated to be derived from renewable
  sources based on generation shares. The indicator is calculated based on the
  following formula:</p>

  <p>The denominator is the total final energy consumption of all energy
  products, while the numerator includes the direct consumption of renewable
  energy sources plus the final consumption of gross electricity and heat that
  is estimated to have come from renewable sources. This estimation allocates
  the amount of electricity and heat consumption to renewable sources based on
  the share of renewables in gross production in order to perform the
  calculation at the final energy level. For instance, if total final
  consumption is 150 TJ for biogas energy, while total final consumption of
  electricity is 400 TJ and heat 100 TJ, and the share of biogas is 10 percent
  in electricity output and 5 percent in heat output, the total reported number
  for biogas consumption will be 195 TJ (150 TJ+400TJ*10%+100TJ*5%).</p>

  <p>The Global Tracking Framework Report (IEA and World Bank, 2013) provides
  more details on the suggested methodology for defining and measuring renewable
  energy (Chapter 4, Section 1, page 201-202). </p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>The IEA has several internal procedures in place for energy data
  validation. This includes energy balance checks, time series analysis and
  reconciling differences in statistical classifications and definitions. UNSD
  also has a number of internal validation procedures to ensure internal data
  consistency, for instance through energy balance checks, and trend
  consistency, e.g. by way of time series analysis. </p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>The country specific commodity balances underlying the IEA energy data are
  based on national energy data of heterogeneous nature converted and adapted to
  fit the IEA format and methodology. Considerable effort has been made to
  ensure that the data adhere to the IEA definitions based on the guidelines
  provided by IRES. Nevertheless, energy statistics at the national level are
  often collected using criteria and definitions which differ, sometimes
  considerably, from those of international organisations. This is especially
  true for non-OECD countries, which are submitting data to the IEA on a
  voluntary basis. The IEA has identified most of these differences and, where
  possible, adjusted the data to meet international definitions. For details on
  recognized country specific anomalies and the corresponding adjustments,
  please refer to country specific notes included in the IEA World energy
  balances documentation file available at: <a
  href="http://wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/WORLDBAL_Documentation.pdf">wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/WORLDBAL_Documentation.pdf</a>
  </p>

  <p>Likewise, UNSD also needs to adjust certain data to fit the international
  methodology set by IRES, thus ensuring data comparability across countries.
  Data from all countries are submitted voluntarily to UNSD, sometimes via
  non-standard formats or through sharing of national publications. The
  identification of such deviations from the standard is an ongoing task, and
  UNSD has started publishing some of this information in a supplement to the
  Energy Statistics Database named &#x201C;Notes on sources&#x201D;, available
  at: unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/pubs/yearbook/, with the goal of
  increasing transparency and providing more and more information with time.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>

  <p>The IEA has attempted to provide all the elements of energy balances down
  to the level of final consumption, for over 150 countries. Providing all the
  elements of supply, as well as all inputs and outputs of the main
  transformation activities and final consumption has often required
  estimations. Estimations have been generally made after consultation with
  national statistical offices, energy companies, utilities and national energy
  experts.</p>

  <p>Likewise, UNSD attempts to provide full energy balances for the 225
  countries and areas it covers, including the 75 or so it covers for SDG
  reporting. This may require searching for national official publications, data
  from other international organizations and expert estimation based on
  reputable sources and other publicly available information. Generally
  speaking, data on the supply side is more widely available than transformation
  activities and final consumption.</p>

  <p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>

  <p>In addition to estimates at a country level, adjustments addressing
  differences in definitions alongside estimations for informal and/or
  confidential trade, production or consumption of energy products are sometimes
  required to complete major aggregates, when key statistics are missing. Such
  estimations and adjustments implemented by IEA have been generally made after
  consultation with national statistical offices, energy companies, utilities
  and national energy experts.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Aggregates are calculated, whether by region or global, using final energy
  consumption as weights.</p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>The IEA data corresponding to OECD countries are derived based on
  information provided in</p>

  <p>the five fuel-specific annual IEA/Eurostat joint questionnaires completed
  by the national administrations. These questionnaires are available online at:
  <a
  href="https://www.iea.org/areas-of-work/data-and-statistics/questionnaires">iea.org/areas-of-work/data-and-statistics/questionnaires</a></p>

  <p>The IEA commodity balances for all other countries are based on national
  energy data of heterogeneous nature, converted and adapted to fit the IEA
  format and methodology based on IRES recommendations.</p>

  <p>In addition to IRES, UNSD has published the <em>Energy Statistics Compilers
  Manual</em> (ESCM - <a
  href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/methodology/escm/">unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/methodology/escm/</a>)
  as a practical companion to assist countries in the compilation of data
  according to the international methodology. UNSD sends countries its own
  questionnaire (<a
  href="file:///C:\Users\leonardo.souza\Documents\Leo\Energy\Sustainable%20Development\SDG%20Indicators\IEA%20coordination\unstats.un.org\unsd\energystats\questionnaire\">unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/questionnaire/</a>),
  except to the countries which are mandated to submit the IEA/Eurostat joint
  questionnaires. In the latter case, UNSD obtains data from the IEA.</p>
QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>The IEA, in co-operation with the Statistical Office of the European
  Communities (Eurostat), has published an Energy Statistics Manual. This Manual
  helps the energy statisticians have a better grasp of definitions, units and
  methodologies. Moreover, IEA has established a quality management framework
  based on the internationally recognized guidelines recommended by IRES to
  ensure quality of statistical products.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>ESCM contains a full chapter on the Generic Statistical Business Process
  Model applied to energy statistics, helping countries manage energy data
  quality. Inside UNSD, processes are established to ensure the quality of its
  products, and such processes are reviewed periodically.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>The IEA follows the guidelines recommended by the IRES to ensure relevance,
  accuracy and reliability, timeliness and punctuality, accessibility and
  clarity as well as coherence and comparability of the data.</p>

  <p>UNSD coordinated input from international organizations and countries to
  publish IRES and its practical companion, the ESCM. Each of both contains a
  chapter on quality assurance and metadata to help guide all countries ensure
  good energy data quality. </p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>The IEA has an extensive data quality validation process through exchange
  with national data providers worldwide. It also convenes its Energy Statistics
  Development Group meeting to discuss energy statistics developments with its
  Members, and cooperates with partners worldwide to ensure coherence of data
  and methods.</p>

  <p>UNSD assesses many quality aspects of the data by means of internal checks,
  exchanges with national data providers, and comparison with alternative
  sources. </p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>Between the various existing data sources, primarily the IEA World Energy
  Balances and the UN Energy Statistics Database, annual total and renewable
  energy consumption for every country and area can be collected. The Tracking
  SDG7: The Energy Progress Report (formerly <em>Sustainable Energy for All
  Global Tracking Framework</em>) is reporting this indicator at a global level
  between 1990 and 2030. </p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>2000 &#x2013; present</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>Disaggregation of the data on consumption of renewable energy, e.g. by
  resource and end-use sector, could provide insights into other dimensions of
  the goal, such as affordability and reliability. For solar energy, it may also
  be of interest to disaggregate between on-grid and off-grid capacity.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>The IEA World energy balances and the UN Energy Statistics Database, which
  provide the underlying data for calculating this indicator, are global
  databases obtained following harmonised definitions and comparable
  methodologies across countries. However, they do not represent an official
  source for national submissions of the indicator 7.2.1 on renewable energy.
  Due to possible deviations from IRES in national methodologies, national
  indicators may differ from the internationally comparable ones.</p>

  <p>Difference may arise due to different sources of official energy data,
  dissimilarities in the underlying methodologies, adjustments and
  estimations.</p>
