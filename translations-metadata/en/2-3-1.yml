  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>Volume of agricultural production of small-scale food producer in crop,
  livestock, fisheries, and forestry activities per number of days.</p>

  <p>The indicator is computed as a <em>ratio of annual output to the number of
  working days in one year</em>. </p>

  <p>FAO proposes to define small-scale food producers as producers who: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>operate an amount of land falling in the first two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent) of the cumulative distribution of land size at national level (measured in hectares); and </li>
    <li>operate a number of livestock falling in the first two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent) of the cumulative distribution of the number of livestock per production unit at national level (measured in Tropical Livestock Units &#x2013; TLUs); and </li>
    <li>obtain an annual economic revenue from agricultural activities falling in the first two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent) of the cumulative distribution of economic revenues from agricultural activities per production unit at national level (measured in Purchasing Power Parity Dollars) not exceeding 34,387 Purchasing Power Parity Dollars.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>The following concepts are adopted for the computation of indicators 2.3.1:</li>
    <li>Small-scale food producers are defined as those falling in the intersection of the bottom 40 percent of the cumulative distribution of land, livestock and revenues.</li>
    <li>Tropical Livestock Units are a conversion scale used for standardization and measurement of the number of livestock heads. One TLU is the metabolic weight equivalent of one cattle in North America. The complete list of conversion factors can be found in the Guidelines for the preparation of livestock sector Reviews </li>
    <li>The concept of productivity is standardized by OECD&#x2019;s Manual for Measuring Productivity. This defines productivity as &#x201C;a ratio of a volume measure of outputs to a volume measure of input use.&#x201D; More information on possible definitions can be found in &#x201C;Productivity and Efficiency Measurement in Agriculture: Literature Review and Gaps Analysis&#x201D;.</li>

SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Given that indicator 2.3.1 is measured on a target population of producers
  &#x2013; those considered as small-scale &#x2013; the ideal data source for
  measuring them is a single survey that collects all the information required
  with reference to individual production units. The most appropriate data
  source for collecting information on total volume of agricultural production
  and on labour input adopted on the agricultural holding would be agricultural
  surveys. Other possibilities to be explored in absence of an agricultural
  surveys are: </p>

  <ol>
    <li>household surveys integrated with an agricultural module, </li>
    <li>agricultural censuses, </li>
    <li>administrative data.</li>
  </ol>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The target population of indicator 2.3.1. are small-scale producers for
  which the best data sources are agricultural surveys. These contain
  information on agricultural production, economic variables and labour input.
  However, agricultural surveys are not conducted in a systematic way, so they
  may be scattered in long time periods. FAO promotes the Agricultural
  Integrated Surveys project (AGRISurvey) which collects data in a yearly basis
  for different modules, e.g. agricultural production. </p>

  <p>Currently, the indicator is produced globally using the Living Standards
  Measurement Study (LSMS) of the World Bank. Some countries contain an
  Integrated Surveys of Agriculture (LSMS-ISA). These surveys include
  information such as farm size, disaggregation by geographic areas, type of
  activities and type of households, values of output, values of production
  costs and number of work hours in different activities. Such surveys have data
  relevant to the computation of the indicators.</p>

  <p>FAO, along with the World Bank and IFAD are compiling harmonized indicators
  of rural livelihoods with information on micro-level household data and the
  LSMS project. The initiative is called RuLIS (Rural Livelihoods Information
  System) which includes the indicators disaggregated by gender, rural areas,
  urban areas, income quintiles and income percentage that comes from
  agriculture.</p>

  <p>Some of the datasets utilized to do the computation of the indicator 2.3.1.
  can be seen in Annex 1 of the document &#x201C;Methodology for Computing and
  Monitoring the Sustainable Development Goal Indicators 2.3.1 and
  2.3.2.&#x201D; available in <a

  <p>Article I of the FAO constitution requires that the Organization collect,

  and agriculture. http://www.fao.org/3/K8024E/K8024E.pdf. </p>
OTHER_METHOD: ''
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda has emphasized the importance of
  enhancing productivity of small-scale food producers, as these producers play
  an important role in the global production of food. The indicator monitors
  progress in this area, where the target is to double productivity by year
  2030. </p>

  <p>The enhancement of labour productivity in small-scale production units also
  has implications on poverty reduction, as small-scale food producers are often
  poor, and are frequently found to be close to subsistence conditions.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Given the approved methodology, the computation of the indicator requires
  survey microdata collected at the farm level on a wide range of variables
  &#x2013; including all element allowing to compute revenues and costs of the
  enterprise together with labour input and the availability of land and
  livestock &#x2013; referred to the same production unit. Such type of surveys
  are seldom collected at the national level. For this reason the availability
  of data for the indicator is altogether limited. In some countries, data can
  be obtained from household surveys reporting details on agricultural
  production. These data sources have to be considered as second-best solution,
  given that their sampling is focused on households and not on food production
  units. While in many countries there is a considerable degree of overlap
  between the population of food producers and households, this is still a
  partial overlap, which can undermine the accuracy of the computation. </p>

  <p>As the indicator is referred to a set of production units &#x2013; those of
  a small scale &#x2014; the denominator needs to summarize information on the
  entire production undertaken in each unit. This requires that volumes of
  production are reported in a common numeraire, given that it is impossible to
  sum up physical units. The most convenient numeraire for aggregating products
  in the numerator is a vector of constant prices. When measured at different
  points in time, as required by the monitoring of the SDG indicators, changes
  in constant values represent aggregated volume changes. </p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>RuLIS aims to produce comparable data on rural incomes, livelihoods and
  development across countries and over time. The rural livelihoods indicators
  are built from survey microdata at the individual, household and community
  level.</p>

  <p>The first stage consists on cleaning the original survey data in Stata to
  obtain harmonized variables. The original, intermediate and final datasets are
  stored in Stata and csv formats in different project folders with a defined
  structure, allowing for an easy query of the data by Stata and R. The second
  stage detects and treats outliers in the produced variables of Stage 1.
  Namely, the best transformation for each variable is found with automatized
  commands. The treatment consists on an imputation on the outlying observations
  detected on the step before. Finally, the imputed datasets are used to compute
  the indicators. </p>

  <p>The analysis of the indicator allows to assess the advancement on the SDG
  2.3 which aims to double the agricultural productivity and income of
  small-scale producers by 2030. </p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>The productivity of small-scale food producers per labor day is the dataset
  is in local currency units (LCU). For each country and year, the LCU labor
  value of production has to be converted into PPP 2011 USD. The process first
  consists on accounting for inflation in the currency, for which the Consumer
  Price Index (CPI) of each country is used; once deflated, it is converted into
  PPP 2011 USD, which allows for a homogenous standard of the indicator. SDG 2.3
  not only focuses on small-scale farmers, but also on women and people with
  indigenous status. The indicator (which is at the household level) is then
  calculated disaggregated by sex, that is, whether the household is female or
  male headed.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <ul>
    <li>At country level</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Variables employed in the computation are subject to outlier detection,
  through Median Absolute Deviations and other approaches, on a case by case
  basis. </p>

  <ul>
    <li>At regional and global levels</li>
  </ul>

  <p>No imputation of data is made at the regional and global level. </p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>No regional or global aggregates can be computed, given the limited
  availability of data. </p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>Countries can rely on the methodology paper available at <a
  href="http://www.fao.org/3/ca3043en/ca3043en.pdf">http://www.fao.org/3/ca3043en/ca3043en.pdf</a>

  .</p>
QUALITY_MGMNT: <p>Logical and arithmetic control of reporting data is carried out.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>The microdata of surveys utilized in the computation are publicly
  available, hence their quality rests with the producers. The quality of the
  calculation was checked with a number of colleagues, and with two independent
  peer-reviewers of the RuLIS project.</p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>Qualitative assessment has been performed on the final estimations of the
  indicator, which was updated this year and compared with 2019 results. PPP
  conversion factors are retrieved from the World Bank and are constantly
  updated, which results in a change of conversion factors and therefore a
  slight modification in the results on indicator 2.3.1. from 2019 to 2021.</p>

  <p>Some countries have data that needs to be assessed further, either checks
  on the raw data and/or the processing of data by the RuLIS team.</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>Indicator 2.3.1 must be disaggregated by classes of
  farming/pastoral/forestry enterprise size. The overall SDG Target 2.3 requires
  specific focus on women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and
  fishers. For this reason, the indicator must be disaggregated by sex, type of
  enterprise and by community of reference.</p>
