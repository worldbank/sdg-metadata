  <p> </p>

  <p>The number of new HIV infections per 1,000 uninfected population, by sex,
  age and key populations as defined as the number of new HIV infections per
  1000 person-years among the uninfected population. </p>

  <p> </p>
UNIT_MEASURE: <p>Number of people per 1000.</p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: <p>Not applicable</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Spectrum modelling is used for the data presented here. Alternative methods
  of measures include household or key population surveys with HIV
  incidence-testing, or routine surveillance among key populations. </p>

  <p> </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>Country teams use UNAIDS-supported Spectrum software to develop estimates
  annually. The country teams are comprised primarily of epidemiologists,
  demographers, monitoring and evaluation specialists and technical partners.
  </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>The UNAIDS Reference Group on Estimates, Modelling and Projections provides
  technical guidance on the development of the HIV component of the Spectrum
  software (www.epidem.org). The Spectrum software is developed by Avenir Health
  (www.avenirhealth.org)&#x2014;which includes a module, the Estimates and
  Projections Package, which is developed by the East-West Center
  (www.eastwestcenter.org). </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>Data sources are compiled all year long. The spectrum models are created in
  the first three months of every year and finalized by `May. </p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: <p>Data are released every year in July</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>The estimates are produced by team of national experts consisting of
  ministry of health, national AIDS advisory groups and development partners.
  The results are signed off on by senior managers at the ministries of health.
  </p>
COMPILING_ORG: >-
  <p>After the data review process the national experts share their results with
  UNAIDS who compiles the data for all countries and calculates regional and
  global estimates. </p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The UN Political Declarations on HIV/AIDS (from 2001, 2011, and 2016) have
  mandated for UNAIDS to support countries to produce these data and for UNAIDS
  to report on the status of the Global HIV epidemic annually as well as through
  the UN Secretary General. </p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The incidence rate provides a measure of progress toward preventing onward
  transmission of HIV. Although other indicators are also very important to the
  HIV epidemic, HIV incidence reflects success in prevention programmes and, to
  some extent, successful treatment programmes, as those will also lead to lower
  HIV incidence. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The methods and limitations for estimating HIV incidence vary based on the
  data and surveillance systems available in countries. </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Countries with high HIV prevalence in the general population have relatively strong surveillance systems with household surveys contributing to the information required to estimate incidence. In epidemics concentrated in key populations, the surveillance systems for key hard-to-reach populations are often not comparable over time due to changing survey and sampling methods. The estimated size of key populations, a critical input to the Spectrum model for concentrated epidemics, can also lead to important under or over estimation of HIV epidemics in concentrated epidemics.</li>
    <li>In many countries trends in recent new infections rely on prevalence data from routine antenatal clinic testing. If those data are biased because women with known positive HIV status are not captured when calculating prevalence, or women found to be negative at initial ANC visit are retested later in the pregnancy, the derived incidence trends might be biased. While some limitations of the models are reflected in the uncertainty bounds the measurement biases and the uncertainty caused by these biases are not easily quantified and are thus not included. </li>
    <li>Although HIV prevalence and incidence among children appears to be reasonably robust in generalized epidemics, estimating the pediatric HIV epidemic in concentrated epidemics remains a challenge because no robust measures exist of fertility among key populations living with HIV. </li>
    <li>Currently UNAIDS only supports the HIV estimates development in countries with populations greater than 250,000. This is primarily due to support capacity. </li>
  </ul>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Longitudinal data on individuals newly infected with HIV would be the most
  accurate source of data but are rarely available for representative
  populations. Special diagnostic tests in surveys or from health facilities can
  also be used to obtain data on HIV incidence but these require very large
  samples to accurately estimate HIV incidence and the latter are also rarely
  representative. HIV incidence is thus modelled using the Spectrum software</p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>The HIV incidence estimates are created by country teams and are signed off
  on by ministry of health managers, including a clear statement that these data
  will be provided for SDG reporting. The SDG focal point in country is copied
  on the requests for clearance. UNAIDS then reviews the input data and results
  to ensure quality. </p>
ADJUSTMENT: <p>No adjustments are made to the estimates. </p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p>&#x2022; At country level: </p>

  <p>Estimates are not collected from countries with populations &lt; 250,000.
  In addition no estimates are available for 10 countries with very small HIV
  epidemics who do not produce estimates. </p>

  <p>For some countries the estimates were not finalized at the time of
  publication. The country specific values are not presented for these
  countries. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>&#x2022; At regional and global levels: </p>

  <p>The countries with populations &lt; 250,000 and the 10 countries that do
  not produce estimates are not included in regional or global level estimates.
  For countries in which the estimates were not finalized at the time of
  publication, the unofficial best estimates are included in the regional and
  global values. </p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Available for the World, the SDG regional groupings, LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS.
  </p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>A description of the methodology is available at: </p>

  <p>Countries are provided with capacity building workshops every year on the
  methods. In addition, they are supported by in country specialists in roughly
  45 countries. Where no in country specialists are available, remote assistance
  is provided. Guidelines are also available at: HIVtools.unaids.org </p>

  <p><strong> </strong></p>
QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>Development of methods is overseen by an external reference group of
  estimates. The actual files are reviewed by UNAIDS global experts to ensure
  consistency between countries.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p> </p>

  <p>Countries are fully involved in the development of the estimates. The final
  values are reviewed for quality by UNAIDS and approved by senior managers at
  national Ministries of Health. </p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>Results are routinely compared to empirical evidence when available. These
  empirical data include research studies, household surveys with incidence
  measurement, and longitudinal HIV surveillance sites when available. If
  inconsistencies are found modifications are considered for the models. Most
  recently a study looking at incidence in sub-Saharan Africa have found
  correspondence. </p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p>Data availability: </p>

  <p>170 countries in 2020. Data are available by age and sex, however there are
  methodological challenges in estimating incidence among key populations</p>

  <p>Disaggregation: </p>

  <p>General population, Age groups (0-14, 15-24, 15-49, 50+ years, All ages),
  sex (male, female, both) Key population data are currently not available as
  methods are being developed. </p>
