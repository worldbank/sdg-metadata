  <p>Definition:</p>

  <p>Revenue is defined in Chapter 4 (paragraph 4.23) of GFSM 2014 an increase
  in net worth resulting from a transaction. It is a fiscal indicator for
  assessing the sustainability of fiscal activities. General government units
  have four types of revenue. The major types of revenue are taxes (GFS code
  11), social contributions (GFS code 12), grants (GFS code 13), and other
  revenue (GFS code 14). Of these, compulsory levies and transfers are the main
  sources of revenue for most general government units. In particular, taxes are
  compulsory, unrequited amounts receivable by government units from
  institutional units. Social contributions are actual or imputed revenue
  receivable by social insurance schemes to make provision for social insurance
  benefits payable. Grants are transfers receivable by government units from
  other resident or non-resident government units or international
  organizations, and that do not meet the definition of a tax, subsidy, or
  social contribution. Other revenue is all revenue receivable excluding taxes,
  social contributions, and grants. Other revenue comprises: (i) property
  income; (ii) sales of goods and services; (iii) fines, penalties, and
  forfeits; (iv) transfers not elsewhere classified; and (v) premiums, fees, and
  claims related to nonlife insurance and standardized guarantee schemes.</p>

  <p>Concepts:</p>

  <p>The transactions and the associated classifications are detailed in Chapter
  5 of GFSM 2014 and are structured to demonstrate how general government (and
  public sector) units raise revenue. Only those taxes and social insurance
  contributions that are evidenced by tax assessments and declarations, customs
  declarations, and similar documents are considered to create revenue for
  government units. Thus, the difference between assessments and expected
  collections represents a claim that has no real value and should not be
  recorded as revenue (see GFSM 2014 paragraph 5.20). The analytic framework of
  GFSM 2014 (like that of the GFSM 2001) builds on the GFSM 1986 framework, and
  extends it by incorporating additional elements that are useful in assessing
  fiscal policy. An important example is the treatment of nonfinancial assets,
  where the sale of such assets is no longer included in revenue. The disposal
  of a nonfinancial asset by sale or barter is not revenue because it has no
  effect on net worth. Rather, it changes the composition of the balance sheet
  by exchanging one asset (the nonfinancial asset) for another (the proceeds of
  the sale). Similarly, amounts receivable from loan repayments and loan
  disbursements are not revenue. In general, transactions that increase net
  worth result from current operations. Capital transfers are an exception. In
  GFSM 2014, capital transfers receivable are classified as revenue because they
  increase the recipient&#x2019;s net worth and they are often indistinguishable
  from current transfers in their effect on government operations. In recording
  cash-based accounting revenue transactions, data representing the tax payments
  received by government, net of refunds paid out during the period covered
  should be reported. These data will include taxes paid after the original
  assessment, taxes paid or refunds deducted from taxes after subsequent
  assessments, and taxes paid or refunds deducted after any subsequent reopening
  of the accounts. Therefore, total tax revenue could be presented on a gross
  basis as the total amount of all taxes accrued, or on a net basis as the gross
  amount minus tax refunds. Revenue categories are presented gross of expense
  categories for the same or related category. In particular, interest revenue
  is presented gross rather than as net interest expense or net interest
  revenue. Similarly, social benefits and social contributions, grant revenue
  and expense, and rent revenue and expense are presented gross. Also, sales of
  goods and services are presented gross of the expenses incurred in their
  production. In cases of erroneous or unauthorized transactions, revenue
  categories are presented net of refunds of the relevant revenue, and expense
  categories are presented net of inflows from the recovery of the expense. For
  example, refunds of income taxes may be paid when the amount of taxes withheld
  or otherwise paid in advance of the final determination exceeds the actual tax
  due. Such refunds are recorded as a reduction in tax revenue. For this reason,
  tax revenue is presented net of non-payable tax credits (see GFSM 2014
  paragraphs 5.29&#x2013;5.32).</p>

  <p>The actual and recommended sources of data for deriving this indicator are
  the fiscal statistics reported to the IMF&#x2019;s Statistics Department.
  These come from various national agencies (Ministries of Finance, Central
  Banks, National Statistics Offices, etc.) and are compiled according to a
  standardized method for data collection: the annual GFS Questionnaire. In the
  2020 annual reporting cycle, approximately 130 countries reported the relevant
  series for monitoring indicator 17.1.1. For current non-reporting countries
  that have demonstrated the capacity to compile and report the relevant GFS
  revenue series, the IMF Statistics Department is engaged in outreach to the
  national authorities, in consultation with the respective IMF Area Departments
  and Offices of the Executive Director, as needed. Capacity Development
  activities will seek to address data deficiencies, including through regional
  workshops. The steps outlined above should allow, over time, for covering
  virtually the entire IMF membership.</p>

FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>Dates when source collection is next planned: IMF Statistics Department
  completed the 2020 round of annual GFS collection in February 2021. The 2021
  collection cycle is planned to take place between September and December
  2021.</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>Country data are disseminated as they are processed and summary World
  Tables and other indicators, including 17.1.1 are planned for release in early
  2021. For most countries, the reference year will be their Fiscal Year 2019
  series, as well as five or more most recent years.</p>

OTHER_METHOD: ''
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Fiscal policy is the use of the level and composition of the general
  government and public sectors&#x2019; spending and revenue&#x2014;and the
  related accumulation of government assets and liabilities&#x2014;to achieve
  such goals as the stabilization of the economy, the reallocation of resources,
  and the redistribution of income. In addition to revenue mobilization,
  government units may also finance a portion of their activities in a specific
  period by borrowing or by acquiring funds from sources other than compulsory
  transfers&#x2014;for example, interest revenue, incidental sales of goods and
  services, or the rent of subsoil assets. Indicator 17.1.1 Total government
  revenue as a proportion of GDP, by source supports understanding
  countries&#x2019; domestic revenue mobilization in the form of tax and nontax
  sources. The indicator will provide analysts with a cross-country comparable
  dataset that highlights the relationship between the four main types of
  revenue as well as the relative &quot;tax burden&quot; (revenue in the form of
  taxes) and &#x201C;fiscal burden&#x201D; (revenue in the form of taxes plus
  social contributions).</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>In principle, GFS should cover all entities that materially affect fiscal
  policies. Cross-country comparisons are ideally made with reference to the
  consolidated general government sector. However, for most developing and many
  emerging market economies, compiling data for the consolidated general
  government and its subsectors is problematic owing to limitations in the
  availability and/or timeliness of source data. For example, a country may have
  one central government; several state, provincial, or regional governments;
  and many local governments. Countries may also have social security funds. The
  <em>GFSM 201</em>4 recommends that statistics should be compiled for all such
  general government units. This reporting structure is illustrated below:</p>

  <p>Some countries report data for the consolidated general government with one
  or more sub-sectors not separately reported. Similarly, there are some
  countries that report &#x201C;consolidated central government&#x201D; without
  necessarily providing the budgetary central government subsector separately.
  To address this, and allow the derivation of regional and world aggregates,
  the country data are presented for the budgetary central government, the
  consolidated central government (with and without social security funds), and
  for consolidated general government, as reported by the national authorities.
  </p>

  <p>For many emerging market and low-income countries with limited statistical
  capacity, budgetary central government is considered the most appropriate
  level of institutional coverage for comparison purposes. Budgetary central
  government, as described in <em>GFSM 2014</em> (paragraph 2.81), is an
  institutional unit of the general government sector particularly important in
  terms of size and power, particularly the power to exercise control over many
  other units and entities. This component of general government is usually
  covered by the main (or general) budget. The budgetary central
  government&#x2019;s revenue (and expense) are normally regulated and
  controlled by a ministry of finance, or its functional equivalent, by means of
  a budget approved by the legislature. </p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Indicator 17.1.1 will be derived using series that are basic to the GFS
  reporting framework. GFS revenue series maintained by the IMF Statistics
  Department are collected in Table 1 of the standard annual data questionnaire.
  Each revenue transaction is classified according to whether it is a tax or
  another type of revenue. GFS revenue aggregates are summations of individual
  entries and elements in this particular class of flows and allow for these
  data to be arranged in a manageable and analytically useful way. For example,
  tax revenue is the sum of all flows that are classified as taxes.
  Conceptually, the value for each main revenue aggregate is the sum of the
  values for all items in the relevant category. The annual GFS series for
  monitoring Indicator 17.1.1will be derived from the data reported by the
  national authorities (in national currency) expressed as a percent of Gross
  Domestic Product (GDP), where GDP is derived from the IMF <em>World Economic
  Outlook</em> database (no adjustments and/or weighting techniques will be
  applied). Mixed sources are not being used nor will the calculation change
  over time (i.e., there are no discontinuities in the underlying series as
  these are key aggregates/ components in all country reported GFS series). The
  presentation will closely align with that currently contained in World Table 4
  from the hard-copy <em>GFS Yearbook</em>: </p>

ADJUSTMENT: <p>N/A</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p>The IMF plans to rely exclusively on officially reported data provided by
  the national authorities using the standard GFS questionnaire based on GFSM
  2014 methodology. No country data estimates for missing values will be
  calculated by the IMF Statistics Department. Where country data are not
  available due to a lack of reporting to the IMF Statistics Department, we plan
  to engage in outreach to the national authorities, in consultation with the
  respective IMF Area Departments and Offices of the Executive Director, as
  needed, to ensure that the key GFS series are reported.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>The IMF Statistics Department will leverage the existing GFS database to
  provide cross-country comparable series in a standardized presentation format.
  We would appreciate further discussion with the IAEG SDGs on the merits of
  deriving regional or global aggregates from the country reported values for
  this indicator.</p>

  <p>Data availability:</p>

  <p>Classification of the indicator into one of the three tiers: We recommend
  that 17.1.1 (like 17.1.2) remain classified as Tier 1: The indicator is
  conceptually clear and internationally agreed standards for compiling
  components and aggregates are available. The underlying data are regularly
  produced by countries, and there is current data available. From the IAEG-SDGs
  Tier Classification description at
  https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/tier-classification/, a key criteria is
  that &#x201C;data are regularly produced by countries for at least 50 per cent
  of countries&#x201D;. The IMF GFS database, with 130+ regular annual reporting
  countries using the same reporting format meets this key criteria. Apart from
  conflict countries, all IMF member countries produce revenue (and expenditure)
  data for surveillance purposes. In recent rounds of soliciting annual GFS
  series from countries, we have specifically encouraged those countries that
  were non-reporters over the past few years to (at a minimum) provide the key
  revenue and expenditure series needed to monitor 17.1.</p>

  <p>Disaggregation:</p>

  <p>The detailed GFS revenue classification structure in the annual
  questionnaire that is used by countries to report data allows for compiling
  17.1.1. The four types of revenue: Taxes, Social contributions, Grants and
  Other revenue are further disaggregated in the annual GFS questionnaire in
  order to encompass all possible forms of revenue administrations. Taxes are
  disaggregated as follows:<br></p>
