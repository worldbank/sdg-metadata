  <p>In response to the Sixty-ninth World Health Assembly (WHA69.19), an online
  National Health Workforce Accounts (NHWA) data platform was developed to
  facilitate national reporting. In addition to the reporting, the platform also
  serves as an analytical tool at the national/regional and global levels. Since
  Its launch in November 2017, Member States are called to use the NHWA data
  platform to report health workforce data. Complementing the national reporting
  through the NHWA data platform, additional sources such as the National
  Census, Labour Force Surveys and key administrative national and regional
  sources are also employed. Most of the data from administrative sources are
  derived from published national health sector reviews and/or official country
  reports to WHO offices.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>Countries are encouraged to adopt a progressive NHWA implementation
  approach building on multi-stakeholder engagement at national and sub-national
  levels. National focal points share the data with WHO through the online NHWA
  data platform. The platform hosted in WHO, is built to facilitate data
  reporting on the indicators listed in the NHWA Handbook and data sharing
  across all the 3 levels of WHO. </p>
FREQ_COLL: <p>Ongoing process</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: <p>Data is released yearly.</p>
DATA_SOURCE: <p>NHWA focal point at national level</p>
COMPILING_ORG: <p>World Health Organization (WHO)</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The Global Strategy for Human Resources for Health: 2030 agenda and the
  progressive implementation of NHWA adopted in Sixty-ninth World Health
  Assembly (WHA69.19). WHA69.19 urges Member States to share health workforce
  data to WHO, to increase the evidence base on health workforce statistics
  globally.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>For detailed metadata and definitions, refer to the National Health
  Workforce Accounts (NHWA) Handbook (<a

REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Data on health workers tend to be more complete for the public health
  sector and may underestimate the active workforce in the private, military,
  nongovernmental organization and faith-based health sectors. In many cases,
  information maintained at the national regulatory bodies and professional
  councils is not updated.</p>

  <p>As data is not always published annually for each country, the latest
  available data has been used. Due to the differences in data sources,
  considerable variability remains across countries in the coverage,
  periodicity, quality and completeness of the original data. Densities are
  calculated using the latest national population estimates from the United
  Nations Population Division&apos;s World Population Prospects database and may
  vary from densities produced by the country.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p><strong><u>Health worker densities by occupation</u></strong></p>

  <p>The figures for number of medical doctors (including generalist and
  specialist medical practitioners) depending on the nature of the original data
  source may include practising medical doctors only or all registered medical
  doctors.</p>

  <p>The figures for number of nursing and midwifery include nursing personnel
  and midwifery personnel, whenever available. In many countries, nurses trained
  with midwifery skills are counted and reported as nurses. This makes the
  distinction between nursing personnel and midwifery personnel difficult to
  draw.</p>

  <p>The figures for number of dentists include dentists in the given national
  and/or subnational area. Depending on the nature of the original data source
  may include practising (active) only or all registered in the health
  occupation. The ISCO -08 codes included here are 2261.</p>

  <p>The figures for number of pharmacists include in the given national and/or
  subnational area. Depending on the nature of the original data source may
  include practising (active) only or all registered in the health occupation.
  The ISCO-08 codes that relate to this occupation is 2262.</p>

  <p>In general, the denominator data for workforce density (i.e. national
  population estimates) are obtained from the United Nations Population
  Division&apos;s World Population Prospects database. In cases where the
  official health workforce report provides density indicators instead of
  counts, estimates of the stock were then calculated using the latest
  population estimates from the United Nations Population Division&apos;s World
  population prospects database.</p>

  <p><strong><u>Health worker distribution by sex and type of
  occupation</u></strong></p>

  <p>The number of male medical doctors as reported by the country is expressed
  as a percentage of total male and female medical doctors reported by the
  country.</p>

  <p>The number of female medical doctors as reported by the country is
  expressed as a percentage of total male and female medical doctors reported by
  the country.</p>

  <p>The number of male nursing personnel as reported by the country is
  expressed as a percentage of total male and female nursing personnel reported
  by the country.</p>

  <p>The number of female nursing personnel as reported by the country is
  expressed as a percentage of total male and female nursing personnel reported
  by the country.</p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>The data recorded in the NHWA data platform is validated by country focal
  points. Data quality checks and country consultation are employed.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: <p>Not applicable</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p>&#x2022;<strong> At country level</strong></p>

  <p>Data for the countries with missing values, if any in the last 5 years are
  estimated with neighbouring comparable countries.</p>

  <p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>

  <p>Not applicable</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>The global average density was estimated as the population weighted average
  of the national densities.</p>

  <p>For the regional average density, data for the countries with missing
  values, if any in the last 5 years were first estimated with neighbouring
  comparable countries. Then the regional average was also computed as a
  weighted average by pooling these estimated values plus the available national
  densities.</p>

  <p>The population for estimating densities at regional and global level are
  based on the latest available estimates from the UN Population Division.</p>
