  <p><strong>Definition: </strong></p>

  <p><strong>Density of medical doctors: </strong>The density of medical doctors
  is defined as the number of medical doctors, including generalists and
  specialist medical practitioners per 10,000 population in the given national

  nursing and midwifery personnel is defined as the number of nursing and
  midwifery personnel per 10,000 population in the given national and/or
  subnational area. The ISCO-08 codes included in this category are 2221, 2222,
  3221 and 3222. <br> </p>

  <p>In response to WHA69.19, an online National Health Workforce Accounts
  (NHWA) data platform was developed to facilitate national reporting. In
  addition to the reporting, the platform also serves as an analytical tool at
  the national/regional and global levels. Since Its launch in November 2017,
  Member States are called to use the NHWA data platform to report health
  workforce data. Complementing the national reporting through the NHWA data
  platform, additional sources such as the National Census, Labour Force Surveys
  and key administrative national and regional sources are also employed. Most
  of the data from administrative sources are derived from published national
  health sector reviews and/or official country reports to WHO offices. </p>

  <p>For detailed metadata and definitions, refer to the National Health

  <p>Data on health workers tend to be more complete for the public health
  sector and may underestimate the active workforce in the private, military,
  nongovernmental organization and faith-based health sectors. In many cases,
  information maintained at the national regulatory bodies and professional
  councils are not updated. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>As data is not always published annually for each country, the latest
  available data has been used. Due to the differences in data sources,
  considerable variability remains across countries in the coverage,
  periodicity, quality and completeness of the original data. Densities are
  calculated using national population estimates from the United Nations
  Population Division&apos;s World Population Prospects database and may vary
  from densities produced by the country. </p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p><strong><u>Health worker densities by occupation</u> </strong></p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>The figures for number of medical doctors (including generalist and
  specialist medical practitioners) depending on the nature of the original data
  source may include practising medical doctors only or all registered medical
  doctors. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>The figures for number of nursing and midwifery include nursing personnel
  and midwifery personnel, whenever available. In many countries, nurses trained
  with midwifery skills are counted and reported as nurses. This makes the
  distinction between nursing personnel and midwifery personnel difficult to
  draw. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>The figures for number of dentists include dentists in the given national
  and/or subnational area. Depending on the nature of the original data source
  may include practising (active) only or all registered in the health
  occupation. The ISCO -08 codes included here are 2261. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>The figures for number of pharmacists include in the given national and/or
  subnational area. Depending on the nature of the original data source may
  include practising (active) only or all registered in the health occupation.
  The ISCO -08 codes that relate to this occupation is 2262. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>In general, the denominator data for workforce density (i.e. national
  population estimates) are obtained from the United Nations Population
  Division&apos;s World Population Prospects database. In cases where the
  official health workforce report provides density indicators instead of
  counts, estimates of the stock were then calculated using the population
  estimated from the United Nations Population Division&apos;s World population
  prospects database (2017). </p>

  <p>The global average density was estimated as the population weighted average
  of the national densities. </p>

  <p>For the regional average density, data for the countries with missing
  values, if any in the last 5 years were first estimated with neighbouring
  comparable countries. Then the regional average was also computed as a
  weighted average by pooling these estimated values plus the available national
  densities. </p>

  <p>The population for estimating densities at regional and global level were
  extracted from the UN Population Division 2017. </p>
