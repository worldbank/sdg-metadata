  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>&#x201C;extent of wetlands&#x201D; </li>
  </ul>

  <p>This term can be defined as the surface area of wetlands. It is measured in
  km<sup>2 </sup>or hectares. It is expected that the surface reported by
  countries in 2018 correspond to the 2017; if not, the reference year should be
  indicated. </p>

  <ul>
    <li>&#x201C;change in the extent of wetlands&#x201D; </li>
  </ul>

  <p>This term refers to the percentage change in area of wetlands from a
  baseline reference. For reporting such change, the previous extent, if known,
  and the period over which the change has taken place should be specified. </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>In order to provide a precise definition of the indicator, it is crucial to
  provide a definition of </p>

  <p><strong>&#x201C;Water related ecosystems&#x201D;. </strong>For this
  purpose, the definition of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands is used.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>the Ramsar definition of &#x201C;wetlands&#x201D;</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Ramsar definition is very broad, reflecting the purpose and global
  coverage of the Convention:</p>

  <p>In accordance with Article 1.1 of the Convention, <br>&#x201C;<em>Wetlands
  are areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial,
  permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish
  or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does
  not exceed six metres</em>&#x201D;.</p>

  <p>In addition, in accordance with Article 2.1, Ramsar Sites
  <br>&#x201C;<em>may incorporate riparian and coastal zones adjacent to the
  wetlands, and islands or bodies of marine water deeper than six metres at low
  tide lying within the wetlands</em>&#x201D;.</p>

  <p><strong>- the Ramsar system of classifying wetland types</strong></p>

  <p>Many national definitions and classifications of &#x201C;wetlands&#x201D;
  are in use. They have been developed in response to different national needs
  and take into account the main biophysical features (generally vegetation,
  landform and water regime, and sometimes also water chemistry such as
  salinity) and the variety and size of wetlands in the locality or region being
  considered.</p>

  <p>The <u>Ramsar Classification System for Wetland Types</u>, adopted at COP4
  in 1990, and amended at COP6 in 1996 (Resolution VI.5) and at COP7 in 1999
  (Resolution VII.11) has value as a basic internationally applicable habitat
  description for sites designated for the Ramsar List of Wetlands of
  International Importance.</p>

  <p>The System (see <strong>Annex 1)</strong> describes the types of wetland
  covered by each of the wetland type codes. Note that the wetland types are
  grouped in three major categories: <u>marine/coastal</u>, <u>inland</u>, and
  <u>human-made</u> wetlands. Within a single Ramsar Site or other wetland,
  there may be wetland types from two or more of these categories, particularly
  if the wetland is large. </p>

  <p>For the purpose of the Target and Indicator, and based on the National
  Reports Parties report on the use of the three major categories. Countries
  also use Ramsar definition that has been internationally agreed under the
  Convention. The minimum information that should be provided is the total area
  of wetlands for each of these three categories with an emphasis on inland
  wetlands or freshwater ecosystems for purpose of indicator 6.6.1 (see table
  below, the explanations of each wetland type code is in Annex 1). </p>

UNIT_MEASURE: <p>The extent of wetlands is measure in km<sup>2</sup></p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>The international standard classification being used is the Ramsar
  Classification System for Wetland Types, adopted at COP4 in 1990, and amended
  at COP6 in 1996 (Resolution VI.5) and at COP7 in 1999 (Resolution VII.11)
  which is a basic internationally applicable habitat description for sites
  designated for the Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance and
  other wetlands. See item 7 Annex 1 for the full classification.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands Secretariat has been collecting and
  analysing data on country implementation since 2000 including information
  about wetland inventories. This is done at intervals of 3 years that is the
  cycle of Country reporting under the Convention </p>

  <p>The 1999 review of the state of wetland inventory worldwide (<em>Global
  review of wetland resources and priorities for wetland inventory </em>-
  GRoWI), which was undertaken for the Ramsar Convention, identified not only
  the major gaps in the extent to which wetland inventory had been undertaken,
  but also found that for the inventories which had been made it was frequently
  very hard to trace their existence, to identify their purpose, scope and
  coverage, and/or to access the information contained in them.</p>

  <p>Another source of information is the update of the Wetland Extent Trends
  (WET) Index that was commissioned by the Ramsar Convention Secretariat to
  WCMC. The Wet Index is an updatable indicator of wetland area trends where
  there are still gaps of information. However, is not applicable at national
  level and has been used, as data are not available at national level. This
  will be fixed with national reports. </p>

  <p>In the format for National Report for COP13 the Contracting Parties agreed
  the inclusion of an indicator on the extent of wetlands and change in the
  extent (indicator 6.6.1). For COP13, 44% of Contracting Parties have completed
  national wetlands inventories and 16% of Parties reported that their wetland
  inventories are in progress. Therefore, all data are provided to the Ramsar
  Secretariat by countries in the form of a country report following a standard
  format, which includes the original data and reference sources and
  descriptions of how these have been used to estimate the extent of wetlands.
  </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>All data are provided by Ramsar Administrative Authorities to the Ramsar
  Secretariat in the form of country reports of implementation of the Convention
  based on a standard format that it is been approved by the Standing Committee.
  The format includes indicators to estimate wetland extent with reference
  sources.</p>

  <p>As indicated in the Quality Assurance section, for remaining countries
  where no information is provided, a report is prepared by the Ramsar
  Secretariat using existing information and a literature search. All country
  reports (including those prepared by the Ramsar Secretariat) are sent to the
  respective Administrative Authority for validation before finalization.</p>

  <p> </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>Data collection process for indicator 6.6.1 has started in 2018 and data
  collection will take place also in 2019. </p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>Updated data with time series and including year 2020 will be released late
  2020. </p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>Ramsar Administrative Authorities prepare and submit to the Ramsar
  Secretariat their National Reports on implementation for each Conference of
  the Parties. Countries with dependent territories prepare more than one
  report. For the remaining countries where no information is provided, a report
  is prepared by the Ramsar Secretariat using existing information and a
  literature search that is validated by the concern countries. </p>
COMPILING_ORG: >-
  <p>Secretariat of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands: The Secretariat expect to
  work with UNEP as co-custodian of this indicator and other<strong> </strong>UN
  agencies and partners.<strong> </strong></p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>At the 52nd meeting of the Standing Committee (SC52) in 2016, Contracting
  Parties of the Convention on Wetlands approved the inclusion of an indicator
  on wetland extent in the National Report to COP13. Subsequently, the UN
  General Assembly in July 2017 adopted the global indicator framework
  (A/RES/71/313) that included Indicator 6.6.1 on change in the extent of
  water-related ecosystems over time. Given that Contracting Parties were
  reporting on extent as part of the National Reports, the Interagency Expert
  Group on SDGs in 2017 appointed the Convention on Wetlands as co-custodian of
  Indicator 6.6.1 using data coming from National Reports, which used as a main
  source wetland inventories.</p>

  <p>As noted in Resolution XIII.7 Enhancing the Convention&#x2019;s visibility
  and synergies with other multilateral environmental agreements and other
  international institutions, the Convention on Wetlands is co-custodian with
  UNEP of SDG Indicator 6.6.1. The Convention contributes to monitoring progress
  with data from National Reports on extent of wetlands, based on the
  Convention&#x2019;s definitions and requirements for reporting. </p>

  <p>Paragraph 40 of Resolution XIII.7 &#x201C;requests the Secretariat to
  continue working with Contracting Parties on the completion of national
  wetland inventories and wetland extent to report on SDG Indicator
  6.6.1&#x201D;.</p>

  <p>The Standing Committee at its 54th and 57th meetings, through Decisions
  SC54-26 and <br>SC57-47, approved the allocation of funds to support
  Contracting Parties in the completion of wetland inventories and report on
  wetland extent under Indicator 6.6.1. </p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands is the Intergovernmental treaty that
  provides the framework for the Conservation and wise use of wetlands and their
  resources. The Convention was adopted in 1971 and came into force in 1975.
  Since then 170 Countries, representing almost 90% on UN member states, from
  all the world&#xB4;s geographic regions have acceded to become Contracting
  Parties under the Convention.</p>

  <p>At its 52nd meeting, in 2016, the Standing Committee of the Ramsar
  Convention agreed that Parties would include in their national reports for the
  13th meeting of the Conference of the Parties, which have been submitted in
  January 2018, data on the &#x201C;extent&#x201D; of wetlands. This requirement
  provides an intergovernmental mechanism to obtain verified data that clearly
  contribute to Indicator 6.6.1 on wetland extent, but also to collect
  information for Target 15.1 which consider other types of ecosystems. </p>

  <p>The indicator provides a measure of the relative extent of inland wetlands
  in a country. It follows the rationale of the forest indicator (Indicator
  15.1.1). The availability of accurate data on a country&apos;s wetland extent
  based on the country&#xB4;s wetland inventory is crucial for the decision
  making regarding policies, restoration of critical wetlands or designation
  under national or international management or protected area categories. </p>

  <p>Changes in the wetland extent reflect wetland loss and degradation for land
  use changes or for other uses and may help identify unsustainable practices
  from different sectors.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The 1999 review of the state of wetland inventory worldwide (Global review
  of wetland resources and priorities for wetland inventory - GRoWI), which was
  undertaken for the Ramsar Convention, identified not only the major gaps in
  the extent to which wetland inventory had been undertaken, but also found that
  for the inventories which had been made it was frequently very hard to trace
  their existence, to identify their purpose, scope and coverage, and/or to
  access the information contained in them. </p>

  <p>In the light of these findings and to help address this lack of access by
  those who need to use wetland inventory for a wide range of Convention
  implementation purposes, the Convention&#x2019;s Scientific &amp; Technical
  Review Panel (STRP) developed a standard model for wetland inventory metadata
  (i.e., data about the characteristics of a wetland inventory, rather than the
  inventory data itself) in order to facilitate those who have inventories in
  making the existence and availability of these more publicly accessible.</p>

  <p>In 2002, several limitations were identified (Ramsar COP8) in the use of EO
  for routinely deriving wetland information. These included the cost of the
  technology, the technical capacity needed to use the data, the unsuitability
  of the data available for some basic applications (in particular in terms of
  spatial resolution), the lack of clear, robust and efficient user-oriented
  methods and guidelines for using the technology, and a lack of solid track
  record of successful case studies that could form a basis for operational
  activities. </p>

  <p>Historical optical data is available from Landsat and Spot missions;
  however, persistent cloud cover in certain regions renders much of these data
  unusable. Distinguishing between permanent and temporary surface water and
  wetlands can therefore be difficult considering the available historical data.
  It is further noted that for complex environments with different wetland types
  in situ data or local knowledge is critical to support the analysis of the EO
  data, and is sometimes the only way to obtain information on certain wetland
  types.</p>

  <p>Another limitation is that some countries are in the process of update or
  complete their national wetlands inventories in others are still gaps or is
  difficult to access the available information.</p>

  <p>Despite the above limitations, the use of the measure of extent of wetlands
  will respond to the indicator and will allow to having a practical mechanism
  in the short term to track the status of water related ecosystems with robust
  data and foster action for the conservation of these important ecosystems.
  </p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Wetland area (Km2 or ha, reference year)/ Change in the extent of wetlands
  (water-related ecosystems over time) a baseline reference and year.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Based upon the national wetland inventory (complete or partial) countries
  provide a baseline figure in square kilometres for the extent of wetlands
  (according to the Ramsar definition) for the year 2017. The minimum
  information that should be provided is the total area of wetlands for each of
  the three major categories; &#x201C;marine/coastal&#x201D;,
  &#x201C;inland&#x201D; and &#x201C;human-made.</p>

  <p>If the information is available countries indicate the % of change in the
  extent of wetlands over the last three years. If the period of data covers
  more than three years, countries provide the available information, and
  indicate the period of the change. For reporting such change, the previous
  extent, if known, and the period over which the change has taken place should
  be specified. </p>

  <p>This indicator can be aggregated to global or regional level by adding all
  country values globally or in a specific region. </p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>The Convention contributes to monitoring progress of Indicator 6.6.1 with
  data from National Reports on extent of wetlands, based on the
  Convention&#x2019;s definitions and requirements for reporting. State Parties
  to the Convention report to the Secretariat every three years that is the
  cycle of the Convention. The data submitted by the State Parties on their
  National Reports on Indicator 6.6.1 are review by the Secretariat and Focal
  Points of the State Parties are contacted in case clarifications are
  necessary. Once the clarifications are made, the data are submitted to the
  SDGs Indicators Database. </p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>As indicated in item 2.c the international standard classification being
  used is the Ramsar Classification System for Wetland Types, adopted at the
  Fourth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Wetlands
  (COP4) in 1990.</p>

  <p>Even that the Convention has a regional approach with six Ramsar regions
  the harmonization of breakdowns on SDG classifications for regional grouping
  for compliance with SDG processes.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <ul>
    <li>At country level</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For countries where no information on wetland inventories was provided to
  the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands Secretariat as part of their National
  Reports to COP13 (16% of countries) a report is in preparation by the Ramsar
  Secretariat using existing information from previous assessments and
  literature search.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>At regional and global levels</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As indicated above </p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Since information is available for all countries, regional and global
  estimates are produced by summation. </p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>Countries under the Ramsar Convention provide all data in the form of a
  country report following a standard format approved by the Standing Committee,
  which includes the original data and reference of wetland inventories as the
  main source of information. </p>

  <p>Detailed methodology and guidance on how to provide the data on extent for
  indicator 6.6.1 in their National Reports and to use Ramsar definition and
  classification is found in the document &#x201C;Guidance on information on
  national wetland extent, to be provided in Target 8 National Wetlands
  Inventory of the Ramsar National Report for COP13&#x201D;. </p>

  <p>The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands has taken many steps to ensure the wise
  use and conservation of wetlands globally. This has included the development
  and promotion of guidance and best practice tools for the inventory,
  assessment and monitoring of change in wetlands with a particular emphasis in
  recent years on the application of an increasing number of satellite-based
  remote sensing approaches (Davidson &amp; Finlayson 2007; Mackay et al. 2009;
  Ramsar Secretariat 2010a). This has become necessary as there is an increasing
  demand for information that can be readily used by wetland managers to help
  stem the ongoing loss and degradation of wetlands. </p>

  <p>The utility of different remote sensing datasets for wetland inventory,
  monitoring and assessment is well established, in particular through the
  provision of site based (Land Use Land Cover (LULC)) maps characterising a
  particular ecosystem, to the analysis of time series data (remote sensing
  datasets collected consistently over a particular time period) to determine
  changes.</p>

  <p>The availability and accessibility of EO datasets suitable for addressing
  the information needs of the Ramsar Convention and wetland practitioners has
  increased dramatically in the recent past; increasing capabilities in terms of
  spatial, temporal and spectral resolution of the data have enabled more
  efficient and reliable monitoring of the environment over time at global,
  regional and local scales.</p>

  <p>The Scientific and Technical Review Panel of the Convention has produced a
  Ramsar Technical Report on &#x201C;Best practice guidelines for the use of
  Earth Observation for wetland inventory, assessment and monitoring: An
  information source for wetland managers provided by the Ramsar Convention for
  Wetlands&#x201D;. The Ramsar Convention and EO based approaches build on those
  previously undertaken on the use of EO technologies for implementation of the
  Convention (Ramsar 2002; Davidson &amp; Finlayson 2007; Mackay et al. 2009)
  and are placed within the conceptualisation of wetland inventory, assessment
  and monitoring that were incorporated into the IF-WIAM (Ramsar Secretariat
  2010b). </p>

  <p>The purpose of the report is to provide an overview of the application of
  EO technologies to inform wetland managers and practitioners, and
  stakeholders, including those from related sectors, such as protected area
  managers and wetland education centre staff (Ramsar Convention 2015) about
  &#x201C;best practice&#x201D; use of EO technologies, taking into account
  requirements and recommendations from the Convention. </p>

  <p>EO provides an effective means for periodic mapping and monitoring over
  regional to global scales. It should, however, not be expected that global
  datasets, can achieve the same high level of accuracy everywhere as a local
  scale map derived through ground surveys and the use of finer resolution
  (aerial, drones) geospatial data.</p>

  <p>Although mapping of land cover and land uses are one of the most common
  uses of EO data, there are still challenges in assessing the current status
  and changes in wetlands over time. Monitoring historical trends and changing
  patterns of wetlands is complicated by the lack of medium to high-resolution
  data in particular prior to 2000. </p>

  <p>Despite the ever expanding data archives, improving quality and increasing
  suitability of EO data for wetland inventory, monitoring and assessment, it is
  important to note that &#x201C;ground-truthing&#x201D; or field based
  assessments and validation are still a vital component of any work involving
  EO data, whose occasional omission may still lead to problematic results. </p>

  <p>Ramsar partners such as Jaxa and ESA have conducted pilot projects that
  provide geospatial information to provide changes to Ramsar, national wetland
  practitioners, decision makers, and NGOs. </p>

  <p>Wetland inventory provides the basis for guiding the development of
  appropriate assessment and monitoring, and is used to collect information to
  describe the ecological character of wetlands including that used to support
  the listing of Ramsar sites, as recorded in the Ramsar Information Sheet
  (Ramsar Secretariat 2012), assessment considers the pressures and associated
  risks of adverse change in ecological character; and monitoring, which can
  include both survey and surveillance, provides information on the extent of
  any change that occurs as a consequence of management actions. </p>

  <p>Under the Convention multiple guidelines have been developed to support
  countries to complete national wetland inventories including the use of
  metadata (Some of these guidelines are mentioned below). More recently in 2020
  the Secretariat prepared a toolkit on wetlands inventory to assist Contracting
  Parties to implement or update a NWI. The aim of the toolkit is to provide
  practical guidance and examples of how to implement an NWI, including a
  step-by-step process and resources to support each recommendation. Good
  practices and examples on the areas of carrying out and updating NWIs,
  inventory methods, data collection, Earth observation and use of wetland
  inventories in decision-making are provided. Examples that illustrate how to
  solve the challenges faced by Contracting Parties are also included. The
  toolkit includes an introduction linking NWIs to SDG targets and expounding on
  the importance of an NWI for decision-making, including suggestions for
  building the case for supporting and protecting wetlands. </p>

  <p>The Secretariat is using the toolkit as a central resource for the
  development of training materials, webinars and other training opportunities
  for Contracting Parties.</p>

QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>Once received, the country reports undergo a rigorous review process to
  ensure correct use of definitions and methodology as well as internal
  consistency. A comparison is made with past information and other existing
  data sources. Regular contacts between national correspondents and Ramsar
  Staff by e-mail and webinars/regional/sub-regional review workshops form part
  of this review process in order to support country capacities in particular
  for monitoring purposes. </p>

  <p>Missing reports prepared by the Ramsar Secretariat for Indictor 6.6.1 are
  sent to the respective Ramsar Administrative Authority for validation before
  finalization and publishing of data. The data are then aggregated at
  sub-regional, regional and global levels by the Ramsar Secretariat team. </p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p>Data availability<strong>:</strong></p>

  <p>Data are available for all countries (143) that submitted National Reports
  for COP13 as well as for previous COPs as indicated below. The data collected
  include information on wetland inventories and extent. For the missing country
  data (16%) as indicated in the &#x201C;Quality assurance section&#x201D; the
  Secretariat will prepare in 2018 reports with the available source of
  information for Indictor 6.6.1 that will be sent to the respective Ramsar
  Administrative Authorities for validation. The gaps of information will be
  addressed during 2018 and 2019 to fully report in late 2020. </p>

  <p>Time series<strong>:</strong></p>

  <p>The Secretariat holds National Report information from COP8 (2002), COP9
  (2005), COP10 (2008), COP11 (2012), COP12 (2015) and COP13 (2018) National
  Reports, in databases which permit an analysis of trends in implementation
  over time, from the 2002-2005 triennium to 2012-2015 that includes specific
  indicators such as wetland inventories. However, for wetland extent the data
  collection has started in 2018. </p>

  <p>Disaggregation<strong>:</strong></p>

  <p>No further disaggregation of this indicator </p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>The national figures are reported by the countries themselves following
  standardized format for the National Reports for the COPs that included
  definitions and reporting years, thus eliminating any discrepancies between
  global and national figures. The reporting format ensures that countries
  provide the full reference for original data sources as well as national
  definitions and terminology. </p>
