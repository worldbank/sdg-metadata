  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator is defined as the total count of population who have been
  recognized as refugees as a proportion of the total population of their
  country of origin, expressed per 100,000 population. </p>

  <p>Refugees refers to persons recognized by the Government and/or UNHCR, those
  in a refugee-like situation and other persons in need of international
  protection. </p>

  <p>Population refers to total resident population in a given country in a
  given year.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>Refugees recognized by the Government and/or UNHCR include: </p>

  <p>(a) persons recognized as refugees by Governments having ratified the 1951
  <em>United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees</em>, and/or
  its <em>1967 Protocol; </em></p>

  <p>(b) persons recognized as refugees under the <em>1969 Organization of
  African Unity (OAU) Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee
  Problems in Africa; </em></p>

  <p>(c) those recognized in accordance with the principles enshrined in the
  <em>Cartagena Declaration; </em></p>

  <p>(d) persons recognized by UNHCR as refugees in accordance with its Statute
  (otherwise referred to as &#x201C;mandate&#x201D; refugees); </p>

  <p>(e) those who have been granted a complementary form of protection (i.e.
  non-Convention); </p>

  <p>(f) persons who have been granted temporary protection on a group basis;
  </p>

  <p>Persons in a <em>refugee-like situation</em> refer to those outside their
  territory of origin who face protection risks similar to those of refugees,
  but who, for practical or other reasons, have not been formally recognized or
  issued documentation to that effect. </p>

  <p><em>Other persons in need of international protection </em>are<em>
  </em>defined as<em> </em>people who are outside their country or territory of
  origin, typically because they have been forcibly displaced across
  international borders, who have not been reported under other categories
  (asylum-seekers, refugees, people in refugee-like situations) but who likely
  need international protection, including protection against forced return, as
  well as access to basic services on a temporary or longer-term basis.</p>
UNIT_MEASURE: '<p>Number of refugees per 100,000 population in country of origin</p>'
CLASS_SYSTEM: <p>Not applicable</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Two main sources exist at country level: a) administrative asylum systems;
  b) direct refugee registration databases. In cases where UNHCR performs
  refugee registration directly, operations provide data which is available with
  a highest degree of disaggregation. In cases where refugees go through a
  Refugee Status Determination (RSD) administrative procedure, data is collected
  by Governments in the biannual Population Statistics Review exercise
  facilitated by focal points in UNHCR country offices. </p>

  <p>Population data are derived from annual estimates produced by the UN
  Population Division (2022 Revision of World Population Prospects, Total
  Population, both sexes). Estimates until 2020 and medium fertility variant
  projection for years thereafter. </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>At the international level, data on refugee populations are routinely
  collected by UNHCR through the biannual Population Statistic Review (PSR) data
  collection. Focal points in each UNHCR operation submit data to the Statistics
  and Demographics Section in the Global Data Service that performs consistency
  checks. In most cases these focal points obtain data either from the UNHCR
  registration database (in countries where UNHCR performs registration
  directly), or from national institutions responsible for data production in
  the area of asylum and refugee matters (National Statistical Offices, Ministry
  of Interior, Ministry of Justice, Administrative Tribunals). When a country
  does not report refugee figures to UNHCR, estimations based on positive
  decisions on asylum applications from previous years are used. Once
  consolidated, data are shared to countries to check their accuracy. Data for
  Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) monitoring will also be sent to countries
  for consultation before publication. </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>Twice a year: by March (data for year-end) and September (data for
  mid-year).<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>Twice a year: by December (data for mid-year) and by June (data for
  year-end)</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>Refugee data are sent to UNHCR Country Offices by member states, usually
  through national institutions responsible for data production in the area of
  refugee and asylum (National Statistical Offices, Ministry of Interior,
  Ministry of Justice, and Administrative Tribunals). Data obtained by UNHCR
  registration systems is provided directly by UNHCR country operations.</p>
COMPILING_ORG: <p>United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The collection and use of refugee data are mandated by the 1951 Refugee
  Convention and by the Statute of the Office of the High Commissioner for
  Refugees. The confidentiality of refugee data and related information is
  highly respected by UNHCR and our partners and the processing and protection
  of personal data are anchored in UNHCR&#x2019;s Data Protection Policy.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Forced displacement as a result of conflict, violence, and other causes
  undermine sustainable development, and can increase the risk of regional
  instability, especially when refugees are hosted in neighbouring countries,
  resulting in possible tensions with local populations. The United Nations
  General Assembly Resolution (A/Res/70/1) that adopted the 2030 Agenda for
  Sustainable Development at paragraph 23 recognizes the relevance of the Agenda
  to meet the needs of refugees, internally displaced persons and migrants on
  the basis that they are among the most vulnerable. It also explicitly states
  that Member States resolve to take further effective measures and actions, to
  &#x201C;<em>strengthen support and meet the special needs of people living in
  areas affected by complex humanitarian emergencies</em>&#x201D;. In addition,
  target 10.7 recognizes for the first time the contribution of migration to
  sustainable development by aiming to &#x201C;facilitate orderly, safe, and
  responsible migration and mobility of people, including through implementation
  of planned and well-managed migration policies&#x201D;.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>This indicator tracks the number of people displaced across national
  borders as a result of persecution, conflict, violence, human rights
  violations, or events seriously disturbing public order. It measures the total
  count of refugee population by country or territory of origin as a proportion
  of the total population. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The estimates of the refugee population by country of origin are collected
  on a bi-annual basis by UNHCR during its annual and mid-year statistical
  reviews. Data is therefore already available and does not impose an additional
  burden on national statistical systems.</p>

DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>At the international level, data on refugee populations are routinely
  collected by UNHCR through the biannual Population Statistic Review (PSR) data
  collection. Focal points in each UNHCR operation submit data to the Statistics
  and Demographics Section in the Global Data Service that performs consistency

  registration database (in countries where UNHCR performs registration
  directly), or from national institutions responsible for data production in
  the area of asylum and refugee matters (National Statistical Offices, Ministry
  of Interior, Ministry of Justice, Administrative Tribunals). When a country
  does not report refugee figures to UNHCR, estimations based on positive
  decisions on asylum applications from previous years are used. Once
  consolidated, data are shared to countries to check their accuracy. Data for
  SDG monitoring will also be sent to countries for consultation before
  publication.</p>

QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>UNHCR follows its Statistical Quality Assurance Framework when producing
  official statistics, including this SDG indicator.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>A number of validation rules are included in the global database, so that
  that data containing errors will not be accepted. All data submitted by
  countries are additionally verified for consistency by the UNHCR Statistics
  and Demographics Section. This includes checks with previous years&#x2019;
  data, and among data reported by different countries. When inconsistencies
  exist, for instance when refugee returns reported by a country differ from the
  arrivals reported by another, the difference is taken back to the countries
  until the difference is resolved. </p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>Assessing the quality of UNHCR&#x2019;s population statistics is a core
  component of the Statistical Quality Assurance Framework noted above.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>National data on refugee populations are available for 192 countries (at
  least one data point between 1951-2020). Time series data on refugees suitable
  for monitoring are available for 192 countries. Approximately 83 percent of
  the refugee population have data which can be disaggregated by sex and 76
  percent which can be disaggregated by age. The age and sex disaggregation for
  the remainder of the population is estimated with statistical methods. </p>

  <p>National population estimates and projections are available in the World
  Population Prospects prepared by the Population Division of the Department of
  Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, and presented
  in a series of Excel files displaying key demographic indicators for each UN
  development group, World Bank income group, geographic region, Sustainable
  Development Goals (SDGs) region, subregion and country or area.</p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>1951-present</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>Recommended disaggregation for this indicator are:</p>

  <p>- sex </p>

  <p> - age (esp. % of children) </p>

  <p>- geographical location (urban/rural)</p>

  <p>- place of residence (in camps/out of camps)</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>UNHCR makes all efforts to obtain data reported directly by member states
  to include in its statistical reports. The gradual implementation of IRRS (see
  below) by countries should improve quality and consistency of national and
  international data.</p>
