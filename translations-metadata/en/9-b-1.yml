  <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>

  <p>The proportion of medium-high and high-tech industry (MHT hereafter) value
  added in total value added of manufacturing (MVA hereafter) is a ratio value
  between the value added of MHT industry and MVA.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>The value added of an industry (industry value added) is a survey concept
  that refers to the given industry&#x2019;s net output derived from the
  difference of gross output and intermediate consumption. Manufacturing
  sector<em> </em>is defined according to the International Standard Industrial
  Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 3 (1990) or Revision
  4 (2008). It refers to industries belonging to sector D in revision 3 or
  sector C in Revision 4.</p>

  <p>Technology classification is based on research and development (R&amp;D)
  expenditure relative to value added otherwise referred as R&amp;D intensity.
  Data for R&amp;D intensity are presented in a report (Galindo-Rueda and
  Verger, 2016) published by the OECD in 2016, which also proposes a taxonomy
  for industry groups with different ranges of R&amp;D expenditure relative to
  their gross value added. MHT industries have traditionally been defined
  exclusively to manufacturing industries. However, there have been recent
  efforts (Galindo-Rueda and Verger, 2016) to extend the definition to
  non-manufacturing industries as well. Nevertheless, medium-high and high
  technology sectors are primarily represented by manufacturing industries.</p>

  <p>The following table includes the classification of MHT industries by ISIC
  Rev. 3 and ISIC Rev. 4.</p>

  <p>Data are collected using General Industrial Statistics Questionnaire which
  is filled by National Statistical Offices (NSOs) and submitted to UNIDO
  annually. Data for OECD countries are obtained directly from OECD. Country
  data are also collected from official publications and official websites.</p>

INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>UNIDO, as the specialized UN agency on industrial development, has the
  international mandate for collecting, producing and disseminating
  internationally comparable industrial statistics. UNIDO&#x2019;s mandate
  covers (i) the maintenance and updating of international industrial statistics
  databases; (ii) methodological and analytical products based on statistical
  research and experience of maintaining internationally comparable statistics;
  (iii) contributions to the development and implementation of international
  statistical standards and methodology; and (iv) technical cooperation services
  to countries in the field of industrial statistics. With the repositioning of
  UNIDO as the focal agency for inclusive and sustainable industrial development
  (ISID), its statistical mandate was expanded to cover all dimensions of
  industrial development, including its inclusiveness and environmental
  sustainability.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Industrial development generally entails a structural transition from
  resource-based and low technology activities to MHT activities. A modern,
  highly complex production structure offers better opportunities for skills
  development and technological innovation. MHT activities are also the high
  value addition industries of manufacturing with higher technological intensity
  and labour productivity. Increasing the share of MHT sectors also reflects the
  impact of innovation.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Value added by economic activity should be reported at least at 3-digit
  ISIC for compiling MHT values.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The indicator is calculated as the share of the sum of the value added from
  MHT economic activities to MVA.</p>
