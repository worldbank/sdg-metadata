  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> </p>

  <p>The percentage of adults (ages 15+) who report having an account (by
  themselves or together with someone else) at a bank or another type of
  financial institution or personally using a mobile money service in the past
  12 months. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong> </p>

  <p>Account ownership is defined as ownership of an individual or jointly owned
  account at a regulated institution, such as a bank, credit union, microfinance
  institution, post office, or mobile money service provider. Data on adults
  with an account also include an additional 3 percent of respondents who
  reported having a debit card in their own name; receiving wages, government
  transfers, a public sector pension, or payments for the sale of agricultural
  products into a financial institution account or mobile money account in the
  past 12 months; or paying utility bills from a financial institution account
  in the past 12 months. </p>

  <p>Financial institution refers to banks and other financial institutions in a
  specific country that offer a transaction account and that fall under
  prudential regulation by a government body (excluding mobile money accounts).
  The definition does not include nonbank financial institutions such as pension
  funds, retirement accounts, insurance companies, or equity holdings such as
  stocks. Data on adults with a mobile money account only include respondents
  who personally used a mobile money service to make payments, buy things, or to
  send or receive money in the past 12 months.</p>

  database are drawn from survey data covering almost 128,000 people in 123
  economies&#x2014;representing 91 percent of the world&#x2019;s population. The
  survey was carried out over the 2021 calendar year by Gallup, Inc. as part of
  its Gallup World Poll, which since 2005 has continually conducted surveys of
  approximately 1,000 people in each of more than 160 economies and in over 150
  languages, using randomly selected, nationally representative samples. The
  target population is the entire civilian, noninstitutionalized population age
  15 and above. </p>

  was done in 2011, and the second in 2014 and the third in 2017. The fourth and
  most recent round was done in 2021. The database covers about 123 countries.

  <p>Global Findex is an individual level survey, measuring individual&#x2019;s
  ownership of accounts. As financial inclusion is an individual-level concept,
  this is the appropriate measure. Other surveys that are done at household
  level may measure the access to finance through another member of the
  household which may overestimate financial inclusion. </p>
