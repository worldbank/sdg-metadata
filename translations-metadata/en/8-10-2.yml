  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> </p>

  <p>The percentage of adults (ages 15+) who report having an account (by
  themselves or together with someone else) at a bank or another type of
  financial institution or personally using a mobile money service in the past
  12 months. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong> </p>

  <p>Financial institution accounts (excluding mobile money) denote the
  percentage of respondents who report having an account (by themselves or
  together with someone else) at a bank, credit union, microfinance institution,
  or post office that falls under prudential regulation by a government
  body.</p>

  <p>Data on adults with a financial institution account include respondents who
  reported having an account at a bank or at another type of financial
  institution, such as a credit union, a microfinance institution, a
  cooperative, or the post office (if applicable). The data also include an
  additional 3 percent of respondents in 2021 who reported receiving wages,
  government transfers, a public sector pension, or payments for agricultural
  products into a financial institution account in the past year; paying utility
  bills or school fees from a financial institution account in the past year; or
  receiving wages, government transfers, or agricultural payments into a card in
  the past year. The definition does not include non-bank financial institutions
  such as pension funds, retirement accounts, insurance companies, or equity
  holdings such as stocks. </p>

  <p>Mobile money accounts denote the percentage of respondents who report
  personally using a mobile money service to make payments, buy things, or to
  send or receive money in the past year. Data on adults with a mobile money
  account include respondents who reported personally using services included in
  the GSM Association&#x2019;s Mobile Money for the Unbanked (GSMA MMU) database
  to pay bills or to send or receive money in the past year. The data also
  include an additional 2 percent of respondents in 2021 who reported receiving
  wages, government transfers, a public sector pension, or payments for
  agricultural products through a mobile phone in the past year. Unlike the
  definition of account at a financial institution, the definition of mobile
  money account does not include the payment of utility bills or school fees
  through a mobile phone. The reason is that the phrasing of the possible
  answers leaves it open as to whether those payments were made using a mobile
  money account or an over-the-counter service.</p>

  <p>The indicators in the <s>2021 </s>Global<u> Findex Database 2021</u><s>
  Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) database</s> are drawn from survey data
  covering almost 128,000 people in 123 economies&#x2014;representing 91 percent
  of the world&#x2019;s population. The survey was carried out over the 2021
  calendar year<u>, and now marks the fourth round of Global Findex data since
  2011. Typically, the survey captures data from more than 140 economies, but
  surveying was postponed in a handful of countries in 2021 due to COVID-19.
  These countries were surveyed in 2022, and data on these additional 17
  countries will be available in 2023. </u> </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><u>The surveying is undertaken</u> by Gallup, Inc. as part of its Gallup
  World Poll<u>, </u><s>,</s> which since 2005 has continually conducted surveys
  of approximately 1,000 people in each of more than 160 economies and in over
  150 languages, using randomly selected, nationally representative samples. The
  target population is the entire civilian, noninstitutionalized population age
  15 and above. <s>Data on additional 17 countries will be available in 2023.

COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>In most developing economies, Global Findex data have traditionally been
  collected through face-to-face</p>

  <p>interviews. Surveys are conducted face-to-face in economies where telephone
  coverage represents less than 80 percent of the population or where in-person
  surveying is the customary methodology. However, during 2021, due to ongoing
  COVID-19&#x2013;related mobility restrictions, face-to-face interviewing was
  not possible in some of these economies.</p>

  <p>Phone-based surveys were therefore conducted in 67 economies that had been
  surveyed face-to-face in 2017. These 67 economies were selected for inclusion
  based on population size, phone penetration rate, COVID-19 infection rates,
  and the feasibility of executing phone-based methods where Gallup would
  otherwise conduct face-to-face data collection, while complying with all
  government-issued guidance throughout the interviewing process. Gallup takes
  both mobile phone and landline ownership into consideration. According to
  Gallup World Poll 2019 data, when face-to-face surveys were last carried out
  in these economies, at least 80 percent of adults in almost all of them
  reported mobile phone ownership. </p>

  <p>All samples are probability-based and nationally representative of the
  resident adult population. </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>Four rounds of data collection are completed, for years: 2011, 2014, 2017,
  and 2022. </p>

  <p>Surveying for 2020 was delayed to 2021 due to COVID-19 restrictions.</p>

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Financial inclusion means that households have access to and can
  effectively use appropriate financial services that are provided responsibly
  and sustainably in a well-regulated environment. Studies show that when people
  participate in the financial system, they are better able to start and expand
  businesses, invest in education, manage risk and absorb financial shocks.
  Measurement is key to understanding financial inclusion and identifying
  opportunities to remove barriers that may be preventing people from using
  financial services. The Global Findex Database 2021 is the first global,
  comparable database of demand-side financial inclusion indicators, capturing
  insights into how adults around the world save, borrow, make payments and
  manage risk.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p> Global Findex Database&#x2014;only measures the &#x2018;perception&#x2019;
  people have about their account ownership and usage by providing
  individual-level survey data on the demographic characteristics of users of
  financial services. This demand-side data collects information on the percent
  of adults who think of themselves as &#x2018;banked&#x2019; and having access
  to an account. The database complements but does replace existing supply-side
  data and other household surveys.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The indicator is based on data collected through individual level surveys
  in each country with representative samples. Data weighting is used to ensure
  a nationally representative sample for each economy. Final weights consist of
  the base sampling weight, which corrects for unequal probability of selection
  based on household size, and the poststratification weight, which corrects for
  sampling and nonresponse error. Poststratification weights use economy-level
  population statistics on gender and age and, where reliable data are
  available, education or socioeconomic status. Regional population weights are
  used to calculate regional aggregates. </p>

  <p>Full report, including methodology and interview procedures, data
  preparation, margin of error and notes by country are all available under

DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>There is a thorough review process of the Global Findex surveys to ensure
  its quality and integrity. Gallup, Inc, the survey vendor for the Global
  Findex database, follows the highest standards for sampling and collecting the
  data and thoroughly vets the data before sharing it with the Global Findex
  team. Once the data is received by the Findex team, the team vets the data by
  comparing headline indicators from the database against data from previous
  rounds of the database.</p>

QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>For quality assurance, the Findex team has additional processes in place
  after it receives the data from Gallup Inc. The Findex team compares the data
  against (the limited number of) demand-side survey data from external sources
  for countries whenever available such as from the Financial Inclusion Insights
  Survey, FinScope, or from Central Banks. The team also consults with key
  practitioners both within the World Bank and at other key organizations to
  confirm the credibility of headline numbers on account ownership. </p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>All the source code for the headline indicator is reviewed by an
  independent and external statistics department within the World Bank. </p>

  <p><strong>Data availability: </strong></p>

  <p>There are 162 countries with regional and World aggregates that have at
  least 1 data point after 2011 for this indicator. </p>

  above); Urbanicity of residence (Rural vs. Urban ); Gender (Female vs.
  Male)</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>Global Findex Database is an individual level survey, measuring an
  individual&#x2019;s perception of ownership of accounts. It assumes financial
  inclusion is an individual-level concept which may create two potential
  discrepancies. First, the data may deviate from supply side data which counts
  the number of accounts and may overstate the level of financial inclusion in a
  country if a significant number of adults have an account they do not use and
  did not formally close. Second, not all demand-side data is the same and that
  the data from different demand-side surveys cannot necessarily be compared if
  the survey method is different. In particular, surveys of individuals cannot
  be compared directly with surveys of household heads, since the use of
  financial services can differ considerably between different household
  members.</p>
