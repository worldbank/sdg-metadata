  database are drawn from survey data covering almost 150,000 people in more
  than 140 economies&#x2014;representing more than 97 percent of the
  world&#x2019;s population. The survey was carried out over the 2014 calendar
  year by Gallup, Inc. as part of its Gallup World Poll, which since 2005 has
  continually conducted surveys of approximately 1,000 people in each of more
  than 160 economies and in over 140 languages, using randomly selected,
  nationally representative samples. The target population is the entire
  civilian, noninstitutionalized population age 15 and above. </p>

  <p>Global Findex is an individual level survey, measuring individual&#x2019;s
  ownership of accounts. As financial inclusion is an individual-level concept,
  this is the appropriate measure. Other surveys that are done at household
  level may measure the access to finance through another member of the
  household which may overestimate financial inclusion. </p>
