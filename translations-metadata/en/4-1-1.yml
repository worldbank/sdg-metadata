  <p>Definition:</p>

  <p>Percentage of children and young people achieving at least a minimum
  proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics during primary education
  (Grade 2 or 3), at the end of primary education, and at the end of lower
  secondary education. The minimum proficiency level will be measured relative
  to new common reading and mathematics scales currently in development.</p>

  <p>Concepts:</p>

  <p><em>Minimum proficiency level (MPL)</em> is the benchmark of basic
  knowledge in a domain (mathematics, reading, etc.) measured through learning
  assessments. In September 2018, an agreement was reached on a verbal
  definition of the global minimum proficiency level of reference for each of
  the areas and domains of Indicator 4.1.1 as described in the <a
  href="http://gaml.uis.unesco.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/MPLs_revised_doc_20190204.docx">Minimum
  Proficiency Levels (MPLs): Outcomes of the consensus building meeting</a>.</p>

  <p><em>Minimum proficiency levels defined by each learning assessment</em></p>

  <p>To ensure comparability across learning assessments, a verbal definition of
  MPL for each domain and levels between cross-national assessments (CNAs) was
  established by conducting an analysis of the performance level descriptors
  (PLDs)<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[1]</a></sup> of
  cross-national, regional, and community-led tests in reading and mathematics.
  The analysis was led and completed by the UIS and a consensus among experts on
  the proposed methodology was deemed adequate and pragmatic.</p>

  <p>The global MPL definitions for the domains of reading and mathematics are
  presented in Table 1.</p>

  <em>recognition of the importance of harmonization of monitoring and
  reporting, the UIS will remain the official source of cross-nationally
  comparable data on education. It will continue to produce international
  monitoring indicators based on its annual education survey and on other data
  sources that guarantee international comparability for more than 200 countries
  and territories. In addition to collecting data, the UIS will work with

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The indicator aims to measure the percentage of children and young people
  who have achieved the minimum learning outcomes in reading and mathematics
  during or at the end of the relevant stages of education. The higher the
  figure, the higher the proportion of children and/or young people reaching at
  least minimum proficiency in the respective domain (reading or mathematic)
  with the limitations indicated under the &#x201C;Comments and
  limitations&#x201D; section.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Learning outcomes from cross-national learning assessment are directly
  comparable for all countries which participated in the same cross-national
  learning assessments. However, these outcomes are not comparable across
  different cross-national learning assessments or with national learning
  assessments. A level of comparability of learning outcomes across assessments
  could be achieved by using different methodologies, each with varying standard
  errors. The UIS has implemented a mechanism of comparability trough a
  consensus on the definition of the skills and contents. The linking though the
  verbal definition. The comparability of learning outcomes over time has
  additional complications, which require, ideally, to design and implement a
  set of comparable items as anchors in advance. Methodological developments are
  underway to address comparability of assessments outcomes over time.</p>

  <p>MPt,n,s = the number of children and young people at stage of education n,

  <p><strong>Harmonize various data sources</strong></p>

  <p>To address the challenges posed by the limited capacity of some countries
  to implement cross-national, regional, and national assessments, actions have
  been taken by the UIS and its partners. The strategies are used according to
  its level of precision and following a <a
  href="http://gaml.uis.unesco.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/GAML6-WD-2-Protocol-for-reporting-4.1.1_v1.pdf">reporting
  protocol</a> that includes the national assessments under specific
  circumstances. </p>

  <p>Completion status </p>

  <p>Combining completion rates with learning outcomes improves our
  understanding of progress towards Target 4.1. Almost all information regarding
  learning is school-based and does not take into account the completion of the
  level. The inclusion of completion in the global list offers to report
  according to completion status. he greatest differences between the SDG 4.1.1
  on learning before completion and the disaggregation by completion are found
  in regions or countries with lower completion and enrollment rates because the
  adjusted (or children completing and learning) indicator is based on a
  quality-adjusted completion rate. This also explains why the largest
  differences occur at the lower-secondary level. Globally, 47% of
  lower-secondary students achieve minimum proficiency in reading according to
  the original SDG 4.1.1 Indicator, but the value for the adjusted indicator
  would fall to 34% of adolescents completing lower secondary and achieving
  minimum proficiency in mathematics. References <a

DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>In each data update period, surveys of recent publications of results of
  national, regional and international assessments are carried out. Then,
  consultations are made with national references and UIS technical focal points
  to verify the availability and validity of the data. To quality control is
  granted by the setting of a Review Panel to discuss any problem/disagreement
  on implementation. The Review Panel is constituted by regionally
  representative experts on learning.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>As currently measured, most learning assessments have different
  methodologies for establishing a Minimum Proficiency level. The UIS and GAM
  establish standardization guidelines to guide the choice of the minimum
  thresholds based on the frameworks of each assessment program. The most
  critical decisions is to choose in each assessment a level for international
  reporting that is consistent with the international definition of MPL. In the
  case of some assessment program it means choosing a different level than the
  one the assessment program had been using for reporting results.</p>

  the selection of the assessment program. </p>
QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>The UIS maintains a global database on learning assessments in basic
  education. The inclusion of a data point in the database to show transparency
  is completed by following a protocol and is reviewed by UIS technical focal
  points to ensure consistency and overall data quality, based on objective
  criteria to ensure that only the most recent and reliable information are
  included in the database. </p>

  <p> </p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: <p>Information not available.</p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>The criteria to ensure the quality and standardization of the data are: the
  data sources must include adequate documentation; data values should be
  representative at the national population level and should otherwise be
  included in a footnote; data values are based on a sufficiently large sample;
  The learning assessment framework covers the minimum set of content in the
  global content framework and the proficiency levels are aligned with the
  minimum proficiency level (MPL) as defined in the global proficiency
  framework; and the data are plausible and based on trends and consistency with
  previously published or reported estimates for the indicator.</p>

  Indicator 4.1.2). Other disaggregation such as location, socio-economic
  status, immigrant status, ethnicity and language of the test at home are based
  on data produced by international organizations administering cross learning
  assessment detailed in the <a
