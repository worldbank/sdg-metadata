  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator is defined as the proportion of water bodies in the country
  that have good ambient water quality. Ambient water quality refers to natural,
  untreated water in rivers, lakes and groundwaters and represents a combination
  of natural influences together with the impacts of all anthropogenic
  activities. The indicator relies on water quality data derived from in situ
  measurements and the analysis of samples collected from surface and
  groundwaters. Water quality is assessed by means of core physical and chemical
  parameters that reflect natural water quality related to climatological and
  geological factors, together with major impacts on water quality. The
  continuous monitoring of all surface and groundwaters is economically
  unfeasible and not required to sufficiently characterize the status of ambient
  water quality in a country. Therefore, countries select river, lake and
  groundwater bodies that are representative and significant for the assessment
  and management of water quality to monitor and report on indicator 6.3.2. The
  quality status of individual water bodies is classified based on the
  compliance of the available water quality monitoring data for the core
  parameters with target values defined by the country. The indicator is
  computed as the proportion of the number of water bodies classified as having
  good quality (i.e. with at least 80 % compliance) to the total number of
  assessed water bodies, expressed as a percentage. </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>The concepts and definitions used in the methodology have been based on
  existing international frameworks and glossaries (WMO 2012) unless where
  indicated otherwise below.</p>

  <p><strong>Aquifer: </strong>Geological formation capable of storing,
  transmitting and yielding exploitable quantities of water. </p>

  <p><strong>Classification of water quality: </strong>If at least 80% of the
  monitoring values for prescribed parameters in a water body comply with their
  respective target values, the water body is classified as having a
  &#x201C;good&#x201D; water quality status<strong>. </strong>Each water body is
  classified as being of &#x201C;good&#x201D; or &#x201C;not good&#x201D;
  status.<em> </em></p>

  <p><strong>Groundwater</strong>: Subsurface water occupying the saturated
  zone. </p>

  <p><strong>Groundwater body</strong>: A distinct volume of groundwater within
  an aquifer or aquifers (EU 2000). Groundwater bodies that cross river basin
  district (RBD) boundaries should be divided at the boundary with each separate
  portion of the groundwater body being reported separately along with its
  respective RBD. </p>

  <p><strong>Lake:</strong> Inland body of standing surface water of significant
  extent. </p>

  <p><strong>Non-point-source pollution:</strong> Pollution of water bodies from
  dispersed sources such as fertilizers, chemicals and pesticides used in
  agricultural activities.</p>

  <p><strong>Parameter: </strong>Water quality variable or characteristic of
  water quality, also called a determinand.</p>

  <p><strong>Point source pollution</strong>: Pollution with a precisely located
  origin.</p>

  <p><strong>Pollution (of water)</strong>: Introduction into water of any
  undesirable substance which renders the water unfit for its intended use.</p>

  <p><strong>Pollutant</strong>: Substance which disrupts and interferes with
  the equilibrium of a water system and impairs the suitability of using the
  water for a desired purpose. </p>

  <p><strong>Reservoir: </strong>Body of water, either natural or man-made, used
  for storage, regulation and control of water resources.</p>

  <p><strong>River: </strong>Large stream which serves as the natural drainage
  for a basin.</p>

  <p><strong>River basin: </strong>Geographical area having a common outlet for
  its surface runoff.</p>

  <p><strong>River basin district: </strong>Area of land, made up of one or more
  neighbouring river basins together with their associated groundwaters (EU,
  2000).</p>

  <p><strong>River water body</strong>: A coherent section of a river that is
  discrete (does not overlap with another water body) and is significant rather
  than arbitrarily designated. </p>

  <p><strong>Stream: </strong>Flowing body of water in a natural surface
  channel.</p>

  <p><strong>Surface water: </strong>Water which flows over, or lies on, the
  ground surface. Note: Indicator 6.3.2 does not include the monitoring of water
  quality in wetlands under monitoring level 1.</p>

  <p><strong>Target value</strong>: A value (or range) for any given water
  quality parameter that indicates the threshold for a designated water quality,
  such as good water quality rather than acceptable water quality.</p>

  <p><strong>Toxic substance</strong>: Chemical substance which can disturb the
  physiological functions of humans, animals and plants.</p>

  <p><strong>Transboundary waters: </strong>Surface or ground waters which mark,
  cross or are located on boundaries between two or more States; wherever
  transboundary waters flow directly into the sea, these transboundary waters
  end at a straight line across their respective mouths between points on the
  low-water line of the banks (UNECE, 1992).</p>

  <p><strong>Water quality index: </strong>The measured water quality results
  for all parameters combined into a numeric value for each monitoring location.
  These scores are then aggregated over the time of the assessment period. The
  index score can range between zero (worst) to 100 (best).</p>
UNIT_MEASURE: >-
  <p>The<strong> proportion</strong> of the number of bodies of water with good
  water quality to the total number of assessed water bodies in percent. To
  classify whether a water body is of &#x201C;good ambient water quality&#x201D;
  or not, a threshold is applied where 80 per cent or more of monitoring values
  meet their target values. This is then applied in turn to the Reporting Basin
  District, and then to the national level to generate the national indicator
  score.</p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>The indicator has been developed in close collaboration with member states
  in a proof of concept phase. There are no international standards.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The recommended sources of data are water quality monitoring data derived
  from in situ measurements and the analysis of samples collected from surface
  and groundwaters in national or sub-national ambient water quality monitoring
  programmes implemented by governmental authorities. Additional water quality
  monitoring data from research or citizen-science monitoring programmes can be
  used to supplement the available authoritative monitoring data, provided they
  are authorised by the national reporting agency.</p>

  <p>The number of monitoring locations required to determine the quality status
  of a water body depends on the type and size of the water body, but a minimum
  of one monitoring location per water body is required. The minimum data
  requirements for calculating this indicator are measurements for all of the
  recommended or alternative core parameters appropriate to the type of water
  body as defined in the methodology. </p>

  <p>Measurements should be taken routinely, at prescribed intervals, or the
  same time of year each year, from the same locations. Even if new monitoring
  stations are introduced, data should continue to be collected from the
  original locations. This ensures that results are comparable between reports,
  thereby enabling trends to be established over time. The monitoring data
  needed for the indicator computation may be collected by different monitoring
  programmes involving different agencies and organizations. It is therefore
  important to establish and maintain centralized data repositories at the
  national level that collate the data from the various stakeholders, ensuring
  compatibility in reporting units between all agencies submitting data. Data
  should be compiled for each core parameter at each sampling location in order
  to calculate the indicator.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The data is collected by UNEP and its Global Environment Monitoring System
  for Water (GEMS/Water) through electronic reporting in the global water
  quality information system GEMStat. At the national level, data reports are
  provided by the GEMS/Water National Focal Points or any other official
  counterpart appointed by the respective government. GEMS/Water offers
  consultation and support in selecting and compiling the required monitoring
  data, defining suitable river basin districts and delineating water bodies, as
  well as computing the indicator, upon request through its helpdesk. Data
  reported by the countries are checked for consistency with respect to the
  monitoring parameters, target values and spatial units and compared with
  monitoring data available in GEMStat, if applicable. </p>

INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>Identification of UNEP as custodian agency for SDG indicator 6.3.2 by
  Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators. GEMS/Water is the mechanism
  within UNEP supporting countries on all aspects around ambient freshwater
  quality.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Good ambient water quality is essential for protecting aquatic ecosystems
  and the services they provide, including: the preservation of biodiversity;
  the protection of human health during recreational use and through the
  provision of drinking water; the support of human nutrition through the
  provision of fish and water for irrigation; the enabling of a variety of
  economic activities; and the strengthening of the resilience of people against
  water-related disasters. Good ambient water quality is therefore closely
  linked to the achievement of many other Sustainable Development Goals.</p>

  <p>Target 6.3 aims at improving water quality and indicator 6.3.2 provides a
  mechanism for determining whether, and to which extent, water quality
  management measures are contributing to the improvement of water quality over
  time. The indicator is also directly linked to indicator 6.3.1 on wastewater
  treatment because inadequate wastewater treatment leads to degradation in
  quality of the waters receiving the wastewater effluents. It directly informs
  progress towards target 6.3 and is strongly linked to target 6.6 on
  water-related ecosystems, as well as target 14.1 on marine pollution (coastal
  eutrophication).</p>

  <p>The methodology recognises that countries have different capacity levels to
  monitor water quality, with many developed countries operating extensive and
  complex programmes that collect and report data to existing reporting
  frameworks beyond the scope of this methodology. For these countries it is
  recognised that this methodology will not contribute to improving their water
  quality; however it must be sufficiently flexible to capture data from
  existing monitoring frameworks without burdening countries with additional
  reporting obligations. Conversely, many of the least developed countries
  currently do not monitor water quality or operate very limited monitoring
  programmes. The methodology must therefore allow these countries to contribute
  to the global indicator, according to their national capacity and available
  resources. </p>

  <p>The development of the methodology builds on best practice for water
  quality monitoring promoted by the UN Environment GEMS/Water programme since
  1978 together with testing by several pilot countries during the Integrated
  Monitoring Initiative Proof of Concept phase of 2016, and external review by
  experts and international organizations. This led to revision of the original
  methodology, which was then further tested through the 2017 global data drive.
  The feedback received has contributed to the present refined methodology.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The monitoring and reporting of SDG Indicator 6.3.2 requires considerable
  national financial and human capacities to regularly measure water quality
  parameters at sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions, and to consistently
  collect, quality-assure and process the monitoring data to compute the
  indicator. Substantial investments in monitoring and data management
  infrastructures, as well as targeted capacity development in water quality
  monitoring programme design and operation, will be required in many countries
  to enhance national capacities to regularly and consistently report on the
  indicator. </p>

  <p>Recognizing the differences in monitoring and data processing capacities
  among countries, the indicator methodology offers a progressive monitoring
  approach allowing countries to start with reporting based on their existing
  capacity and progressively enhance the data coverage and indicator
  significance with increasing capacity.</p>

  <p>Level 1 monitoring includes a set of general, easily measurable,
  physico-chemical water quality parameters that can indicate water quality
  degradation. They can be used to assess the quality status of water bodies,
  facilitating global comparability and maintaining a balance between the
  significance of the indicator and the monitoring requirements for each
  country. </p>

  <p>Level 2 monitoring allows countries with enhanced capacities to include
  additional water quality parameters, such as toxic substances and biological
  monitoring, as well as more sophisticated quality classification schemes to
  assess and report on the quality of their water bodies more accurately.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p><strong>Computation Method:</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator is computed by first classifying all assessed water bodies
  based on the compliance of the monitoring data collected for selected
  parameters at monitoring locations within the water body with
  parameter-specific target values: </p>
