  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI) for Government Expenditures is
  defined as the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure, divided by the
  Agriculture value added share of GDP, where Agriculture refers to the
  agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting sector. The measure is a
  currency-free index, calculated as the ratio of these two shares. National
  governments are requested to compile Government Expenditures according to the
  Government Finance Statistics (GFS) and the Classification of the Functions of
  Government (COFOG), and Agriculture value added share of GDP according to the
  System of National Accounts (SNA).</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>Agriculture refers to the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting
  sector, or Division A of ISIC Rev 4 (equal to Division A+B of ISIC Rev 3.2).
  </p>

  <p>Government Expenditure are all expense and acquisition of non-financial
  assets associated with supporting a particular sector, as defined in the
  Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2014 developed by the
  International Monetary Fund (IMF). NOTE: Transactions in assets and
  liabilities, such as loans by general government units (disbursement and
  repayment), are excluded when compiling COFOG data for GFS reporting
  purposes.</p>

  <p>Government Expenditure are classified according to the Classification of
  the Functions of Government (COFOG), a classification developed by the
  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and published by
  the United Nations Statistical Division (UNSD). </p>

  <p>Agriculture value-added and GDP are based on the System of National
  Accounts (SNA). </p>

CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>The Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG) is a detailed
  classification of the functions, or socioeconomic objectives, that general
  government units aim to achieve through various kinds of expenditure.
  Functions are classified using a three level scheme, consistent with the
  International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities
  (ISIC), Rev.4. In particular, the scheme includes: </p>

  <ol>
    <li>10 first-level, or two digit, categories, referred to as divisions, including Economic Affairs (04) and Environmental Protection (05); </li>
    <li>2) within each division, 2 or more 3-digit three-digit categories, referred to as groups, such as Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting (042) and Protection of Biodiversity and Landscapes (054); and </li>
    <li>3) within each group, one or more four-digit categories, referred to as classes, such as Agriculture (0421), Forestry (0422) and Fishing and hunting (0423). </li>
  </ol>

  <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) questionnaire on Governmen Finance
  Statistics (GFS) collects data on the first two levels. The FAO questionnaire
  aims at collecting information on classes, as well as a breakdown of the
  related expenditure in recurrent and capital expenditures. The three
  classification levels and the contents of each class are described in the GFSM
  2014, accessible at https://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/gfsm/. </p>

  <p>FAOSTAT geographic classification is used to aggregate indicators across
  country groups (<a
  href="http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#definitions">http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#definitions</a>).</p>
SRC_TYPE_COLL_METHOD: ''
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Data on government expenditures is collected from countries through an
  annual questionnaire administered by FAO. These data are not affected by
  sampling error, given that countries typically compile the questionnaires
  administered by FAO on the basis of their financial and accounting systems,
  using administrative information on government expenditures based on the
  availability and comprehensiveness of source data. For some countries that do
  not report directly data to FAO, information is obtained either from the IMF
  GFS database; however in this cases information is not disaggregated of the
  basis of COFOG 042; or from official national governmental websites. </p>

  <p>Data on agriculture value-added and GDP are retrieved from the system of
  national accounts. THs is normally an analytical framework that includes
  national data from a mix of survey, census and administrative (e.g. tax)
  sources. This data is sourced from the UN Statistics Division, which provides
  national accounts estimates for 220 countries and territories.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>Data for the denominator are annually collected from countries using the
  FAO questionnaire on Government Expenditure on Agriculture (GEA), developed in
  collaboration with the IMF. Data from countries may be supplemented, for
  countries with missing information, with data collected by the IMF, or
  published on official national governmental websites. The official
  counterpart(s) at country level are, depending on the country, from the
  national statistics office, the ministry of finance (or other central planning
  agency), or the ministry of agriculture. Validation and consultation were
  conducted through various FAO commissions and committees, including its two
  agricultural statistics commissions in Africa and the Asia and Pacific, its
  Committee on Agriculture and Livestock Statistics in Latin America and the
  Caribbean, and its Committee on Agriculture. </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>The 2020 reference year data collection cycle for Government Expenditure on
  Agriculture (GEA) will start in March/April 2021. Due to time required to
  collect, compile and publish national data, countries may experience delays in
  reporting timely data. </p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>As this data is largely compiled annually, the next release for this
  indicator is planned for November2021, covering data up to reference year 2020
  (for the countries for which data collection, compilation, release is more
  timely).</p>

  <p>Article I of the FAO Constitution requires the Organization to
  &quot;collect, analyse, interpret and disseminate information relating to
  nutrition, food and agriculture.&quot;
  (http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5584e/x5584e00.htm). Member countries reaffirmed
  this mandate in 2000. Within the FAO&apos;s statistical program of work,
  member countries endorsed the development of an investment statistics domain,
  including ongoing work on government expenditure on agriculture, during
  meetings of three statutory bodies: the Asia and Pacific Commission on
  Agricultural Statistics (APCAS) held in Vietnam in February 2014; the African
  Commission on Agricultural Statistics (AFCAS) held in Morocco in December
  2013; and the IICA working group on agricultural and livestock statistics for
  Latin America and the Caribbean, held in Trinidad and Tobago in June 2013.

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>An Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI) greater than 1 reflects a higher
  orientation towards the agriculture sector, which receives a higher share of
  government spending relative to its contribution to economic value-added. An
  AOI less than 1 reflects a lower orientation to agriculture, while an AOI
  equal to 1 reflects neutrality in a government&#x2019;s orientation to the
  agriculture sector.</p>

  <p>Government spending in agriculture includes spending on sector policies and
  programs; soil improvement and soil degradation control; irrigation and
  reservoirs for agricultural use; animal health management, livestock research
  and training in animal husbandry; marine/freshwater biological research;
  afforestation and other forestry projects; etc.</p>

  <p>Spending in these agricultural activities helps to increase sector
  efficiency, productivity and income growth by increasing physical or human
  capital and /or reducing inter-temporal budget constraints. </p>

  <p>However, the private sector typically under-invests in these activities due
  to the presence of market failure (e.g. the public good nature of research and
  development; the positive externalities from improved soil and water
  conditions; lack of access to competitive credit due to asymmetric information
  between producers and financial institutions, etc.). Similarly, the high risk
  faced by agricultural producers, particular smallholders unable to hedge
  against risk, often requires government intervention in terms of income
  redistribution to support smallholders in distress following crop failures and
  livestock loss from pests, droughts, floods, infrastructure failure, or severe
  price changes. </p>

  <p>Government spending in agriculture is essential to address these market
  failures and the periodic need for income redistribution. This leads to
  several potential indicators for the SDGs, which include: a) the level of
  Government Expenditure on Agriculture (GEA); b) the Agriculture share of
  Government Expenditure, and c) the AOI for Government Expenditures.</p>

  <p>An indicator that measures GEA levels fails to take into account the size
  of an economy. If two countries, A and B, have the same level of GEA, and the
  same agriculture contribution to GDP, but country A&#x2019;s economy is 10
  times that of country B, setting the same target levels for GEA fails to take
  economic size into account. </p>

  <p>An indicator that measures the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure
  fails to take into account the relative contributions of the agricultural
  sector to a country&#x2019;s GDP. Consider two countries with the same
  economic size, C and D, where agriculture contributes 2 per cent to C&#x2019;s
  GDP, and 10 per cent to country D&#x2019;s GDP. If total Government
  Expenditures were equal in both countries, C would experience greater relative
  investment in Agriculture than D. If total Government Expenditures differed,
  the result could be magnified or diluted.</p>

  <p>The AOI index takes into account a country&#x2019;s economic size,
  Agriculture&#x2019;s contribution to GDP, and the total amount of Government
  Expenditure. While the indicator does not allow setting of a universal and
  achievable target, it is useful to interpret the AOI in combination with its
  numerator and denominator separately: the Agriculture share of Government
  Expenditure and the Agriculture value-added Share of GDP</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Since the numerator of this data is based on financial and accounting
  systems and administrative sources, there is no confidence interval or
  standard error associated with government expenditure data. For the
  denominator, national accounts data typically do not provide any standard
  error or confidence interval information.</p>

  <p>The key limitation with this indicator is that Consolidated General
  Government expenditure &#x2013; the best measure for cross-country comparisons
  &#x2013; is not available for all reporting countries. While most advanced
  economies &#x2013; and many emerging market economies &#x2013; do report these
  data, many smaller and/or low income economies either do not have significant
  fiscal interventions in agriculture at the state/provincial and
  local/municipal levels; or do not have adequate source data to compile
  meaningful general government estimates for each subsector, as relevant. Given
  that in several countries, significant intervention in agriculture is
  implemented by sub-national governments, the Indicator 2.a.1 is calculated
  using the highest level of government available for the reporting country. For
  some countries, such as India, where the general government sector is defined
  for fiscal policy purposes as budgetary central government plus state
  government, the Indicator will take this into account.</p>

  <p>Annex I lists the reporting countries, their M49 code, the latest year for
  which data are available and the level of government for which data has been
  reported. The level of government notation used is as follows: GG:
  Consolidated General Government; CG Consolidated Central Government (excluding
  Social Security Funds): CGI: Consolidated Central Government (including Social
  Security Funds); BA: Budgetary Central Government.</p>

  <p>Agriculture refers to the Division A of ISIC Rev 4 (agriculture, forestry,
  fishing and hunting), equal to Division A+B of ISIC Rev 3.2.</p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>Countries are asked to validate and update historical questionnaire data
  that pre-populates their questionnaire. FAO validates data against historical
  series, as well as data submitted to IMF and from country&apos;s websites.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>FAO revises data only when historical revisions or missing historical data
  are provided by countries, the IMF or when they become available through the
  national authorities&#x2019; websites. For example, prefilled questionnaires
  are sent out with reported data for n-2 through n-5, which countries are asked
  to review, revise where needed, and - to the extent possible &#x2013; fill-in
  missing information. Conversion of values into millions is done as well. </p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <h5><strong>At country level</strong></h5>

  <p>Missing values of -2019 government expenditure in agriculture were
  forecasted using trends in GDP and 3 to 5 year moving averages of the share of
  agriculture in total expenditure. Forecasted values are employed to compute
  regional and global aggregates, but not presented at the national level.</p>

  <h5><strong>At regional and global levels</strong></h5>

  <p>Regional and global aggregates of 2019 were based on a mixture of data
  directly reported by countries (to FAO or IMF) and forecasts of missing
  values. For the 2001-2018 period, regional and global aggregates are computed
  on the basis of based on available data countries and interpolations of
  missing.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Global and regional estimates are compiled by first separately summing
  across countries the four individual components of the index: government
  expenditure on agriculture, total government expenditure, agriculture
  value-added, and GDP. These are added only for those countries in a region (or
  globally) for which all components are available, and the index is then
  calculated for this larger region.</p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>Countries are requested to reference the IMF&apos;s Government Finance
  Statistics Methodology (GFSM 2014), particularly Chapter 6 - Annex:
  Classification of the Functions of Government and Chapter 2 &#x2013;
  Institutional Units and Sectors, available at
  https://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/gfsm.</p>
QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>Comparisons of key aggregates reported in both the FAO GEA and IMF GFS
  questionnaires are periodically conducted in order to ensure
  consistency.<br></p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>The FAO Statistics Quality Assurance Framework is available at:
  http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3664e/i3664e.pdf</p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>The quality of the data may vary considerably among countries, as not all
  of them apply the COFOG classification. In such cases, FAO seeks to validate
  reported aggregates against fiscal data published by national
  authorities&apos; websites. Since 2012, the FAO Statistics Division also
  fields a detailed annual questionnaire on Government Expenditure on
  Agriculture that is pre-populated with key major aggregates reported to the
  IMF or identified by FAO. Where reported details diverge significantly from
  the pre-populated aggregates, queries are sent to national counterparts, to
  ensure the methodological quality, objectivity and reliability of the data
  submitted by countries.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>Data are reported for the highest level of government available
  (Consolidated general government, consolidated central government or budgetary
  central government) and are available for about 100 countries on a regular
  basis. In some cases (for example, India and Pakistan), data may reflect the
  general government sector as per national norm. That is, budgetary central
  government combined with state government. </p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>From 2001 to 2019</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>Since this indicator is based on national accounts data and total
  government expenditures, it does not allow for disaggregation by demographic
  characteristics or geographic location.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>When in-country compilation errors are identified and FAO has modified
  government expenditure data reported by countries, or where errors are found
  in comparison with the IMF GFS COFOG data or fiscal data published on national
  authorities&apos; websites after querying to national respondents, there may
  be some difference between data reported by FAO and unrevised national
  figures.</p>
