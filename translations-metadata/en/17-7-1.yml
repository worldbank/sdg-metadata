  <p>United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has identified a number of SDGs
  where uptake of Environmentally Sound Technologies (ESTs) contributes to their
  achievement: Goal 7 on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable
  and modern energy for all; Goal 8 on the promotion of sustained, inclusive and
  sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work
  for all; Goal 12 on sustainable consumption and production patterns, and Goal
  13 on taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.</p>

  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>Environmentally Sound Technologies (ESTs) are technologies that have the
  potential for significantly improved environmental performance relative to
  other technologies. ESTs protect the environment, are less polluting, use
  resources in a sustainable manner, recycle more of their wastes and products,
  and handle all residual wastes in a more environmentally acceptable way than
  the technologies for which they are substitutes. ESTs are not just individual
  technologies. They can also be defined as total systems that include know-how,
  procedures, goods and services, and equipment, as well as organizational and
  managerial procedures for promoting environmental sustainability. This means
  that any attempt to provide an assessment of investment into ESTs on either a
  global or national level must incorporate ways to track funding flows into
  both hard and soft technologies.</p>

  <p>The purpose of this indicator is to develop a methodology for tracking the
  total amount of approved funding to promote the development, transfer,
  dissemination and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies. A
  two-pronged approach is suggested: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Level 1. Use globally available data to create a proxy of funding flowing to developing countries for environmentally sound technologies, or of trade in environmentally sound technologies </li>
    <li>Level 2. Collect national data on investment in environmentally sound technologies.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>There are five crucial elements which make up Goal 17 - finance, capacity
  building, systemic issues, technology and trade- all of which must be aligned
  for the Goal to be achieved. One of the key lessons over the last couple of
  decades has been that in order to achieve potential growth, measurement of
  financial flows (in terms of amount, type, geography, donor, recipient and
  investors) is a necessary step in such a transformation. In order to
  understand systemic issues, trade, capacity building, technology lock-in,
  innovation and deployment, we must understand how, why and where finance is
  being deployed. Only then we can begin to realign its flows.</p>

  <p>In deciding which technologies are most appropriate, there will always be
  trade-offs between cost and a range of economic, social, health and
  environmental impacts, to be determined based on national or local contexts
  and priorities. It would also not be feasible for all countries to strive
  towards the best available technologies globally if these are not appropriate
  in a domestic context. Given the highly contextual nature of ESTs, it is
  therefore something that is better defined at the national level, taking into
  account the national context and mainstream technologies nationally. However,
  there is a real need to support national, sub-national governments and other
  actors with decision-making and defining the most nationally or locally
  appropriate technologies.</p>

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Rational environmental management means making the best use of resources to
  meet basic human needs without destroying the sustaining and regenerative
  capacity of natural systems. This requires a good understanding of the
  intersecting elements within the larger frame of development and implies the
  adoption and use of alternative, environmentally sound development strategies
  and related technologies. ESTs play an important role to improve efficiency of
  resources (materials and energy), reduce pollution and waste from different
  sectors. The importance of Environmentally Sound Technology was first
  emphasized during Rio Earth Summit in 1992 and ever since it has become a
  major component of international environmental cooperation. Access to ESTs
  also play a central role in the ground-breaking agreement, the Addis Ababa
  Action Agenda &#x2013; which is an implementing mechanism for the global
  Sustainable Development Goals (2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development). The
  agreement was reached by the 193 UN Member States.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Various definitions of &#x2018;environmentally sound technology&#x2019;
  exist and are in use. Terms such as &#x2018;environmental technology&#x2019;,
  &#x2018;clean technology&#x2019;, &#x2018;and cleantech &#x2019;or
  &#x2018;low-carbon technology&#x2019; are sometimes used, although low-carbon
  technology can be considered as a sub-set of green technology. Other less
  commonly used terms include climate-smart and climate-friendly technology.</p>

  <p>Additional limitations include: different baseline years in numerous
  available databases, and the different purposes of available databases.</p>

  <p>Many national statistical systems lack the capacity to compile information
  on &#x201C;Total amount of approved funding to promote the development,
  transfer, dissemination and diffusion of environmentally sound
  technologies&#x201D;. Compiling data on this indicator presents a challenge in
  terms of consistent definitions and approaches. However, this methodology
  recognizes these difficulties and provides an approach that can allow a
  comparability among countries.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The methodology for tracking the total amount of approved funding to
  promote the development, transfer, dissemination and diffusion of
  environmentally sound technologies has a two-pronged approach: </p>

  <p><strong>Level 1</strong>. Use globally available data to create a proxy of
  funding flowing to developing countries for environmentally sound
  technologies, or of trade in environmentally sound technologies.</p>

  <p>The international proxy that provides the closest indicator of investment
  flows is that of trade (e.g. traded goods and services that have been
  internationally agreed to have a positive environmental benefit), using HS
  codes of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding Systems, preferably
  more than 6-digit level. </p>

  <p>The sectors deemed to be ESTs through historical research include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Air pollution control,</li>
    <li>Wastewater management,</li>
    <li>Solid and Hazardous waste management,</li>
    <li>Renewable Energy,</li>
    <li>Environmentally Preferable Products,</li>
    <li>Water Supply &amp; Sanitation,</li>
    <li>Energy Storage &amp; Distribution,</li>
    <li>Land &amp; Water Protection &amp; Remediation.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Level 2.</strong> Collect national data on investment in
  environmentally sound technologies.</p>

  <p>Identifying ESTs at the national level is a simple process based on a set
  of criteria and simple analysis tool &#x2013; the UNEP Questionnaire on
  Environmentally Sound Technologies, which is used to evaluate if the
  environmental objective is achieved and if the technology is suitable for the
  local market.</p>

  <p>The environmental objective can be assessed with the performance and
  operational data (in relevance to the environmental objective) and if the
  technology has any negative environmental impact (cross- media effects).
  Suitability of the technology for the national market could involve
  assessments on criteria related to economics, market considerations and
  suitability to local natural conditions.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Environmental considerations:<ul>
        <li>Performance of the technology and operational data &#x2013; Can the technology achieve the environmental objective (e.g. this could be compliance with local environmental law)</li>
        <li>Cross-media effects &#x2013; Does the technology has negative environmental impacts?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>2. Local considerations &#x2013; Is the technology suitable for the local
  market?</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <ul>
        <li>Economics impacts &#x2013; Capital and operating costs</li>
        <li>Market considerations &#x2013; Local market availability and suitability</li>
        <li>Suitability for the local natural conditions</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>Level 1 indicators: UNEP uses a random sampling for few countries and
  calculate the total of HS codes for export, import, re-export and re-import
  and compare with the automated produced amounts for those countries. The value
  per HS is also compared with the data on the COMTRADE database.</p>

  <p>Level 2 indicators: UNEP carries out data validation procedures and contact
  countries for clarification if needed. </p>
