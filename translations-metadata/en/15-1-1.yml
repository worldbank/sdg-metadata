  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>Forest area as a proportion of total land area</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>To provide a precise definition of the indicator, it is crucial to provide
  a definition of its two components:</p>

  <p>&#x201C;Forest&#x201D; and &#x201C;Land Area&#x201D;. </p>

  <p>According to the FAO, <strong><u>Forest</u></strong> is defined as:
  &#x201C;land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters
  and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these
  thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under
  agricultural or urban land use&#x201D;. More specifically:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Forest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of other predominant land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 meters.</li>
    <li>It includes areas with young trees that have not yet reached but which are expected to reach a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of 5 meters or more. It also includes areas that are temporarily unstocked due to clear-cutting as part of a forest management practice or natural disasters, and which are expected to be regenerated within 5 years. Local conditions may, in exceptional cases, justify that a longer time frame is used.</li>
    <li>It includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those of specific environmental, scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest.</li>
    <li>It includes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectares and width of more than 20 meters.</li>
    <li>It includes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of trees that have, or are expected to reach, a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of at least 5 meters.</li>
    <li>It includes areas with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless of whether this area is classified as land area or not.</li>
    <li>It includes rubberwood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations.</li>
    <li>It includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height and canopy cover criteria are met.</li>
    <li>It excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive orchards and agroforestry systems when crops are grown under tree cover. Note: Some agroforestry systems such as the &#x201C;Taungya&#x201D; system where crops are grown only during the first years of the forest rotation should be classified as forest.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong><u>Land area</u></strong> is the country area excluding area under
  inland waters and coastal waters.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Country area</strong>: Area under national sovereignty. It is the sum of land area, inland waters and coastal waters. It excludes the exclusive economic zone.</li>
    <li><strong>Inland waters</strong>: Areas corresponding to natural or artificial water courses, serving to drain natural or artificial bodies of water, including lakes, reservoirs, rivers, brooks, streams, ponds, inland canals, dams, and other land-locked waters. The banks constitute limits whether the water is present or not.</li>
    <li><strong>Coastal waters</strong>: Waters located in-between the land territory and the outer limit of the territorial sea. They comprise &apos;&apos;Internal waters&apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos;Territorial sea,&quot; and where applicable, &apos;&apos;Archipelagic waters.&quot; </li>
  </ul>
UNIT_MEASURE: <p>The indicator is expressed as percent.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p><strong>Forest area:</strong></p>

  <p>Data on Forest area are collected by FAO through the Global Forest
  Resources Assessment (FRA). This assessment has been carried out at regular
  intervals since 1946, and are now produced every five year. The latest of
  these assessments, FRA 2020, contains information for 236 countries and
  territories on about 60 variables related to the extent of forests, their
  conditions, uses and values for several points in time. </p>

  <p><strong>Land area:</strong></p>

  <p>Data on land area are collected from FAO members through the annual FAO
  Questionnaire on Land Use, Irrigation and Agricultural Practices. Missing data
  may be sourced from national statistical yearbooks and other official
  government data portals. Supplemental information for further gap filling may
  be derived from national and international sectoral studies and reports, as
  well as from land cover statistical information compiled by FAO and
  disseminated in FAOSTAT.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p><strong>Forest area:</strong></p>

  <p>Officially nominated national correspondents and their teams prepare the
  country reports for the assessment. Some prepare more than one report as they
  also report on dependent territories. For the remaining countries and
  territories where no information is provided, a report is prepared by FAO
  using existing information, literature search, remote sensing or a combination
  of two or more of them.</p>

  <p>All data are provided to FAO by countries in the form of a country report
  through an on-line platform following a standard format, which includes the
  original data and reference sources and descriptions of how these have been
  used to estimate the forest area for different points in time. The on-line
  platform is used for all data entry, review and quality control.</p>

  <p><strong>Land area:</strong></p>

  <p>The Land Use, Irrigation and Agricultural Practices FAO Questionnaire, <a
  href="http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-home/questionnaires/en/">http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-home/questionnaires/en/</a>,
  is sent annually to 205 countries and territories reaching out the National
  Focal Points in National Institutions, typically National Statistical Offices,
  Ministries of Agriculture or other relevant Agencies. The questionnaire is
  sent in Excel format together with accompanying cover letter explaining FAO
  mandate and scope of the data collection. </p>

  <p>Data returned in questionnaire are checked against previous reports and for
  consistency with the other land categories reported in questionnaire.
  Depending on questionnaire completeness and in case of non-reporting, Land
  area data may be derived by subtracting the Inland waters area and the Coastal
  waters area from the Country area. Missing Land area data are also imputed by
  carry-forward of the latest value officially reported by the country. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Forest area:</strong></p>

  <p>Data collection process for FRA 2020 was launched in 2018 and data
  collection took place in 2018-2019. Data collection for the next FRA is
  expected to start in 2022. </p>

  <p><strong>Land area:</strong></p>

  <p>The FAO Land Use, Irrigation and Agricultural Practices questionnaire is
  part of the joint dispatch of three questionnaires on agri-environmental
  statistics. Questionnaires are dispatched annually on 4th October with
  deadline after 4 weeks; first and second follow-ups are sent within 5 and 10
  weeks respectively from the dispatch date. </p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p><strong>Forest area:</strong></p>

  <p>Data with updated time series and including year 2020 was released July
  2020. Next release of a complete FRA dataset is scheduled for 2025. The
  possibilities of a more frequent reporting on forest area and other key
  indicators are currently being evaluated, and some countries may provide
  updates on forest area before 2025. </p>

  <p><strong>Land area:</strong></p>

  <p>Data release in year 2021 is planned for 30 June 2021.</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p><strong>Forest area:</strong></p>

  <p>Data on forest area are provided by the countries and reported to FAO
  through a global network of officially nominated national correspondents. For
  the countries and territories which do not have a national correspondent, a
  desk study is prepared by FAO using previously reported information,
  literature search, remote sensing or their combination.</p>

  <p><strong>Land area:</strong></p>

  <p>Data are provided by the National Focal Points in National Institutions,
  typically National Statistical Offices, Ministries of Agriculture or other
  relevant Agencies. Records of National Focal Points is maintained up to date
  through the questionnaire cover where countries are requested to confirm the
  focal point contact detail (e.g. Name, Title, Administration and Office, Email
  and Web site address) as well as through official communications from
  countries to FAO, or information provided to FAO during meetings, conferences
  or commissions. </p>
COMPILING_ORG: <p>FAO</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>Article 1 of FAO&#x2019;s constitution specifies that, &#x201C;The
  Organization shall collect, analyze, interpret, and disseminate information
  related to nutrition, food and agriculture.&#x201D; In this regard, FAO
  collects national level data from member countries, which it then standardizes
  and disseminates through corporate statistical databases. FAO is the custodian
  UN agency for 21 SDG indicators, including 15.1.1.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Forests fulfil a number of functions that are vital for humanity, including
  the provision of goods (wood and non-wood forest products) and services such
  as habitats for biodiversity, carbon sequestration, coastal protection and
  soil and water conservation. </p>

  <p>The indicator provides a measure of the relative extent of forest in a
  country. The availability of accurate data on a country&apos;s forest area is
  a key element for forest policy and planning within the context of sustainable
  development.</p>

  <p>Changes in forest area reflect the demand for land for other uses and may
  help identify unsustainable practices in the forestry and agricultural
  sector.</p>

  <p>Forest area as percentage of total land area may be used as a rough proxy
  for the extent to which the forests in a country are being conserved or
  restored, but it is only partly a measure for the extent to which they are
  sustainably managed.</p>

  <p>The indicator was included among the indicators for the Millennium
  Development Goals (MDG indicator</p>

  <p>7.1 &#x201C;Proportion of land covered by forest&#x201D;).</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Assessment of forest area is carried out at infrequent intervals in many
  countries. Although the improved access to remote sensing data can help some
  countries to update their forest area estimates more frequently, estimation of
  forest area using remote sensing techniques has certain challenges. In
  particular the assessment of forest area relates to land use, while remote
  sensing primarily assesses land cover. Furthermore, gradual changes, such as
  forest regrowth, require several years to become detectable in satellite
  imagery. In addition, forest areas with low canopy cover density (e.g. 10-30%)
  are still difficult to detect at large scale with affordable remote sensing
  techniques.</p>
DATA_COMP: <p>Forest area (reference year) / Land area (reference year) * 100</p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>All data submitted by countries to FRA, including the FAO estimates made in
  case of desk studies, are available at the FRA on-line platform (<a
  href="https://fra-data.fao.org/">https://fra-data.fao.org/</a>). The platform
  also includes the calculated indicator for 15.1.1. A request for validation
  was sent to the Head of Forestry of each country before finalization and
  publishing of data.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>When FAOSTAT land area data indicate variations in land area that are
  inconsistent and do not reflect real changes but are the effect of changes in
  assessment methodology or countries not having revised historical data points,
  inconsistent data points are imputed by FAO.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <ul>
    <li>At country level</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For countries and territories where no information was provided to FAO for
  FRA 2020 (47 countries and territories representing 0.5 percent of the global
  forest area), FAO made estimates of forest area based on existing information
  from previous assessments, literature search, remote sensing or a combination
  of these data sources. </p>

  <p>For countries/territories not included in FAOSTAT, land area data is
  collected from other sources (national Web sites, etc.). In a few cases where
  land area for a specific reference year is not available in FAOSTAT, land area
  is imputed by using data for closest available reference year.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>At regional and global levels</li>
  </ul>

  <p>See above</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Since information is available for all countries and territories, regional
  and global estimates are produced by aggregating country-level data. </p>

  </p>
QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>FAO is responsible for the quality of the internal statistical processes
  used to compile the published datasets. The FAO Statistics Quality Assurance
  Framework (SQAF), available at: <a
  href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3664e/i3664e.pdf">http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3664e/i3664e.pdf</a>,
  provides the necessary principles, guidelines and tools to carry out quality
  assessments. FAO is performing an internal bi-annual survey (FAO Quality
  Assessment and Planning Survey) designed to gather information on all of
  FAO&#x2019;s statistical activities, notably to assess the extent to which
  quality standards are being implemented with a view to increasing compliance
  with the quality dimensions of SQAF, documenting best practices and prepare
  quality improvement plans, where necessary. Domain-specific quality assurance
  activities are carried out systematically (e.g. quality reviews,
  self-assessments, compliance monitoring).</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>Data on forest area reported by countries to FAO are subject to a rigorous
  review process to ensure correct use of definitions and methodology as well as
  internal consistency. A comparison is made with past assessments and other
  existing data sources. Regular contacts between national correspondents and
  FAO staff by e-mail, through the FRA online platform and during
  regional/sub-regional review workshops form part of this review process.</p>

  <p>Data on land area are reported by FAO members through the FAO Land Use,
  Irrigation and Agricultural Practices questionnaire. Collected data are
  routinely checked for internal consistency (e.g. outliers and significant
  variation in time series). Observed discrepancies are routinely checked and
  validated with countries.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p>Data availability:</p>

  <p>Forest area data are available for all 236 countries and territories
  included in FRA 2020, and for the following points in time: 1990, 2000, 2010,
  2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.</p>

  <p>Land area data are updated annually and are available by country and year,
  covering up to 246 countries and territories for the period 1961-2018.</p>

  <p>Disaggregation:</p>

  <p>No further disaggregation of this indicator.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>Sources of discrepancies:</p>

  <p>The national figures in the database are reported by the countries
  themselves following standardized format, definitions and reporting years,
  thus eliminating any discrepancies between global and national figures. The
  reporting template requests that countries provide the full reference for
  original data sources as well as national definitions and terminology.
  Separate sections in the template country reports deal with the analysis of
  data (including any assumptions made and the methods used for estimates and
  projections to the common reporting years); calibration of data to the
  official land area as held by FAO; and reclassification of data to the classes
  used in FAO&#x2019;s Global Forest Resources Assessments.</p>
