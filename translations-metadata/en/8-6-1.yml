  <p><strong>Definition: </strong></p>

  <p>This indicator conveys the proportion of youth (aged 15-24 years) not in
  education, employment or training (also known as &quot;the youth NEET
  rate&quot;). </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts: </strong></p>

  <p>For the purposes of this indicator, youth is defined as all persons between
  the ages of 15 and 24 (inclusive). According to the International Standard
  Classification of Education (ISCED), education is defined as organized and
  sustained communication designed to bring about learning. Formal education is
  defined in ISCED as education that is institutionalized, intentional, and
  planned through public organizations and recognized private bodies and, in
  their totality, make up the formal education system of a country. </p>

  <p>Non-formal education, like formal education is defined in ISCED as
  education that is institutionalized, intentional and planned by an education
  provider but is considered an addition, alternative and/or a complement to
  formal education. It may be short in duration and/or low in intensity and it
  is typically provided in the form of short courses, workshops, or seminars.
  Informal learning is defined in ISCED as forms of learning that are
  intentional or deliberate, but not institutionalized. It is thus less
  organized and less structured than either formal or non-formal education.
  Informal learning may include learning activities that occur in the family, in
  the workplace, in the local community, and in daily life, on a self-directed,
  family-directed or socially directed basis. For the purposes of this
  indicator, persons will be considered in education if they are in formal or
  non-formal education, as described above, but excluding informal learning.
  </p>

  <p>Employment is defined as all persons of working age who, during a short
  reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or
  provide services for pay or profit. The difference between the two series for
  a given country is the operational criteria used to define employment, with
  one series based on the statistical standards from the 13th International
  Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) and the other series based on 19th
  ICLS standards. In the 19th ICLS series, employment is defined more narrowly
  as work done for pay or profit, while activities not done mainly in exchange
  for remuneration (i.e., own-use production work, volunteer work and unpaid
  trainee work) are recognized as other forms of work. </p>

  <p>For the purpose of this indicator, persons are considered to be in training
  if they are in a non-academic learning activity through which they acquire
  specific skills intended for vocational or technical jobs. </p>

  <p>Vocational training prepares trainees for jobs that are based on manual or
  practical activities, and for skilled operative jobs, both blue and white
  collar related to a specific trade, occupation, or vocation. Technical
  training on the other hand imparts learning that can be applied in
  intermediate-level jobs, in particular those of technicians and middle
  managers. </p>
UNIT_MEASURE: <p>Percent (%)</p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>Youth are defined as persons aged 15 to 24 (inclusive) for the purpose of
  this indicator.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The preferred official national data source for this indicator is a
  household-based labour force survey. </p>

  <p>In the absence of a labour force survey, a population census and/or other
  type of household survey with an appropriate employment module may be used to
  obtain the required data. </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The ILO Department of Statistics processes national household survey
  microdata sets in line with internationally agreed indicator concepts and
  definitions set forth by the International Conference of Labour Statisticians.
  For data that could not be obtained through this processing or directly from
  government websites, the ILO sends out an annual ILOSTAT questionnaire to all
  relevant agencies within each country (national statistical office, labour
  ministry, etc.) requesting the latest annual data and any revisions on
  numerous labour market topics and indicators, including many SDG indicators.
  </p>
FREQ_COLL: <p>Continuous</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: <p>Continuous</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>Mainly national statistical offices, and in some cases labour ministries or
  other related agencies, at the country-level. In some cases, regional or
  international statistical offices can also act as data providers. </p>
COMPILING_ORG: <p>International Labour Organization (ILO) </p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The ILO is the UN focal point for labour statistics. It sets international
  standards for labour statistics through the International Conference of Labour
  Statisticians. It also compiles and produces labour statistics with the goal
  of disseminating internationally comparable datasets, and provides technical
  assistance and training to ILO Member States to support their efforts to
  produce high quality labour market data.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The share of youth not in employment, education or training (youth NEET
  rate) provides a measure of youth who are outside the educational system, not
  in training and not in employment, and thus serves as a broader measure of
  potential youth labour market entrants than youth unemployment. It includes
  discouraged worker youth as well as those who are outside the labour force due
  to disability or engagement in household chores, among other reasons. Youth
  NEET is also a better measure of the current universe of potential youth
  labour market entrants as compared with the youth inactivity rate, as the
  latter includes those youth who are outside the labour force and are in
  education, and thus are furthering their skills and qualifications. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The calculation of this indicator requires having reliable information on
  both the labour market status and the participation in education or training
  of youth. The quality of such information is heavily dependent on the
  questionnaire design, the sample size and design and the accuracy of
  respondents&apos; answers. </p>

  <p>In terms of the analysis of the indicator, in order to avoid
  misinterpreting it, it is important to bear in mind that it is composed of two
  different sub-groups (unemployed youth not in education or training and youth
  outside the labour force not in education or training). The prevalence and
  composition of each sub-group would have policy implications, and thus should
  also be considered when analysing the NEET rate. </p>

DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>The ILO engages in annual consultations with Member States through the
  ILOSTAT questionnaire and related Statistics Reporting System (StaRS).
  National data providers receive a link to the portal where they can review all
  national SDG data available on ILOSTAT.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>Through the ILO Harmonized Microdata initiative, the ILO strives to produce
  internationally comparable labour statistics based on the indicator concepts
  and definitions adopted by the International Conference of Labour
  Statisticians.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <ul>
    <li><strong>At country level </strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Multivariate regression and cross-validation techniques are used to impute
  missing values at the country level. The additional variables used for the
  imputation include a range of indicators, including labour market and school
  enrolment data. However, the imputed missing country values are only used to
  calculate the global and regional estimates; they are not used for
  international reporting on the SDG indicators by the ILO. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>For further information on the estimates, please refer to the ILO modelled
  estimates methodological overview, available at
  https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/ilo-modelled-estimates/</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>At regional and global levels </strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Regional and global figures are aggregates of the country-level figures
  including the imputed values.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>The NEET aggregates are derived from the ILO modelled estimates that are
  used to produce global and regional estimates of, amongst others, rates of
  youth not in employment, with employment based on the 13<sup>th</sup> ICLS
  standards. These models use multivariate regression and cross-validation
  techniques to impute missing values at the country level, which are then
  aggregated to produce regional and global estimates. The regional and global
  NEET rates are obtained by first adding up, across countries, the numerator
  and denominator of the formula that defines NEET rates as outlined above. Once
  both magnitudes are produced at the desired level of aggregation, the ratio
  between the two is used to produce the NEET rate for each regional grouping
  and the global level. Notice that this direct aggregation method can be used
  due to the imputation of missing observations. For further information on the
  estimates, please refer to the ILO modelled estimates methodological overview,
  available at
  https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/ilo-modelled-estimates/.
  </p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>To calculate this indicator, reliable data are needed on both the labour
  market situation and the participation in the educational system of the youth.
  These data are collected at the national level mainly through labour force
  surveys (or other types of household surveys with an employment module). For
  the methodology of each national household survey, one must refer to the most
  comprehensive survey report or to the methodological publications of the
  national statistical office in question. </p>
QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>The processes of compilation, production, and publication of data,
  including its quality control, are carried out following the methodological
  framework and standards established by the ILO Department of Statistics, in
  compliance with the information technology and management standards of the
  ILO.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>Data consistency and quality checks are regularly conducted for validation
  of the data before dissemination in the ILOSTAT database. </p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>The final assessment of the quality of information is carried out by the
  Data Production and Analysis Unit of the ILO Department of Statistics. In
  cases of doubt about the quality of specific data, these values are reviewed
  with the participation of the national agencies responsible for producing the
  data if appropriate. If the issues cannot be clarified, the respective
  information is not published. </p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability: </strong></p>

  <p>Data for this indicator is available for 173 countries and territories in
  the 13<sup>th</sup> ICLS series and 102 countries and territories in the
  19<sup>th</sup> ICLS series. </p>

  <p><strong>Time series: </strong></p>

  <p>Country data for this indicator is available as of 2000 in the SDG
  Indicators Global Database, but longer time series are available in ILOSTAT.
  Global and regional data in this submission covers a period of 2005 to
  2022.</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>No disaggregation is specifically required for this indicator, although
  having it disaggregated by sex is desirable, as is disaggregation by detailed
  age groups within the youth age band. </p>

  <p> </p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>A number of factors can limit the comparability of statistics on the youth
  NEET rate between countries or over time. When differing from international
  standards, the operational criteria used to define employment and the
  participation in education or training will naturally affect the comparability
  of the resulting statistics, as will the coverage of the source of statistics
  (geographical coverage, population coverage, age coverage, etc.).</p>

  <p>Work statistics for countries not using the same set of statistical
  standards are not comparable. As such, each series is based on a single set of
  standards (i.e., 13<em>th</em> or 19<em>th</em> ICLS) and contains only data
  comparable within and across countries, allowing data users to continue making
  meaningful time series analysis and international comparisons. Users should
  not compare data across series.</p>
