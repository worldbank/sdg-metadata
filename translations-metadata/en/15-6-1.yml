  <p><strong>Definition</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator is defined as the number of countries that have adopted
  legislative, administrative and policy frameworks to ensure fair and equitable
  sharing of benefits. It refers to the efforts by countries to implement the
  Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable
  Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on
  Biological Diversity<em> </em>(2010) and the International Treaty on Plant
  Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (2001).</p>

  <p>The Nagoya Protocol covers genetic resources and traditional knowledge
  associated with genetic resources, as well as the benefits arising from their
  utilization by setting out core obligations for its contracting Parties to
  take measures in relation to access, benefit-sharing and compliance. The
  objectives of the International Treaty are the conservation and sustainable
  use of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture and the fair and
  equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of their use, in harmony with
  the Convention on Biological Diversity. </p>

  <p>The Protocol provides greater legal certainty and transparency for both
  providers and users of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge,
  and therefore, encourages the advancement of research on genetic resources
  which could lead to new discoveries for the benefit of all. </p>

  <p>The Nagoya Protocol also creates incentives to conserve and sustainably use
  genetic resources, and thereby enhances the contribution of biodiversity to
  development and human well-being. In addition, Parties to the Protocol are to
  encourage users and providers to direct benefits arising from the utilization
  of genetic resources towards the conservation of biological diversity and the
  sustainable use of its components.</p>

  <p>The International Treaty has established the Multilateral System of Access
  and Benefit-sharing, which facilitates exchanges of plant genetic resources
  for purposes of agricultural research and breeding, by providing a transparent
  and reliable framework for the exchange of crop genetic resources. The
  Multilateral System is instrumental to achieving the conservation and
  sustainable use of plant genetic resources as well as the fair and equitable
  sharing of benefits arising from their use. </p>

  <p>The ABS Clearing-House is a platform for exchanging information on access
  and benefit-sharing established by Article 14 of the Protocol, The ABS
  Clearing-House is a key tool for facilitating the implementation of the Nagoya
  Protocol, by enhancing legal certainty and transparency on procedures for
  access, and for monitoring the utilization of genetic resources along the
  value chain. The Protocol requires Parties to make information on legislative,
  administrative and policy measures available to the ABS Clearing-House.
  Non-Parties are also encouraged to make this information available in the same
  manner.</p>

  <p>In order to promote compliance with all the provisions of the International
  Treaty, including access and benefit sharing obligations, and to address
  issues of non-compliance, the Governing Body of the International Treaty has
  approved the procedures and operational mechanisms by Resolution 2/2011. Under
  V. 1, it is noted that each Contracting Party is to submit to the Compliance
  Committee, established by the Governing Body by Resolution 3/2006, through the
  Secretary, a report on the measures it has taken to implement its obligations
  under the International Treaty in one of the six languages of the United
  Nations. Contracting Parties have submitted their report by using a standard
  reporting format approved by the Governing Body, sending it to the Secretary.
  The Secretariat of the International Treaty prepares an analysis of reports
  received from Contracting Parties for consideration by the Compliance
  Committee. </p>

  <p>Relevant Resolutions of the Governing Body: <a

  (Resolution 9/2013)</p>

  <p>Regarding the number of SMTA, the Secretariat of the International Treaty
  has developed a system called &#x201C;Easy-SMTA&#x201D; (the link provided
  under 3.as Data sources) to assist users of plant genetic resources with
  compiling and generating SMTAs in the six official languages of the
  International Treaty and reporting on SMTAs concluded in accordance with the
  instructions made by the Governing Body of the International Treaty.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The Nagoya Protocol, to be operational, requires that certain enabling
  conditions are met at the national level for its effective implementation. In
  particular, countries will need, depending on their specific circumstances, to
  revise legislative, administrative or policy measures already in place or
  develop new measures in order to meet the obligations set out under the
  Protocol. </p>

  <p>In particular, the Nagoya Protocol provides that Parties are to take
  legislative, administrative or policy measures, as appropriate, to ensure the
  fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of
  genetic resources, including for genetic resources that are held by indigenous
  communities, and benefits arising from the utilization of traditional
  knowledge associated with genetic resources. </p>

  <p>The ABS Clearing-House is a platform for exchanging information on access
  and benefit-sharing established by Article 14 of the Protocol, The ABS
  Clearing-House is a key tool for facilitating the implementation of the Nagoya
  Protocol, by enhancing legal certainty and transparency on procedures for
  access, and for monitoring the utilization of genetic resources along the
  value chain. The Protocol requires Parties to make information on legislative,
  administrative and policy measures available to the ABS Clearing-House.
  Non-Parties are also encouraged to make this information available in the same
  manner. The goal is to allow users of genetic resources and associated
  traditional knowledge to easily find information on the ABS Clearing-House on
  how to access these resources and knowledge in an organized manner, and all in
  one convenient location.</p>

  <p>The International Treaty stipulates that Contracting Parties ensure the
  conformity of its laws, regulations and procedures with their obligations
  under the International Treaty (Article 4). Under the Multilateral System of
  Access and Benefit-sharing (Articles 10-13), countries grant each other
  facilitated access to their plant genetic resources, while users of plant
  genetic material from the Multilateral System are encouraged to share their
  benefits with the Multilateral System. Such benefits should primarily flow to
  farmers in developing countries who promote the conservation and sustainable
  use of plant genetic resources. </p>

  <p>Pursuant to Article 21, the Governing Body adopted the Procedures and
  operational mechanism to promote compliance and address issues of
  non-compliance. Under the monitoring and reporting in the Procedures, each
  Contracting Party is requested to submit a report on the measures it has taken
  to implement its obligations under the International Treaty, including the
  access and benefit-sharing measures. Contracting Parties report using an
  agreed standard format and through the Online Reporting System on Compliance.
  Additionally, information on the number of Standard Material Transfer
  Agreements is gathered from the Data Store of the International Treaty through
  Easy-SMTA. SMTA is a mandatory contract that Contracting Parties of the
  International Treaty have agreed to use whenever plant genetic resources
  falling under the Multilateral System are made available. </p>

  <p>Indicator 15.6.1 directly measures progress made by countries in
  establishing legislative, administrative or policy frameworks on access and
  benefit-sharing (ABS). By developing their ABS frameworks, countries are
  contributing to the achievement of SDG Target 15.6 and to the conservation and
  sustainable use of biological and genetic diversity. Progress in this
  indicator is assessed through measuring the increase in the number of
  countries that have adopted ABS legislative, administrative and policy
  measures and that have made available this information in the ABS
  Clearing-House and through the Online Reporting System on Compliance of the
  International Treaty in relation to plant genetic resources for food and
  agriculture. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>This indicator can be used to measure progress in adopting ABS legislative,
  administrative and policy frameworks over time.</p>

  <p>This indicator does not assess the scope or effectiveness of ABS
  legislative, administrative and policy frameworks. </p>

  <p>The notion of framework suggests that there is a complete set of rules
  established on access and benefit-sharing. However, it is difficult to have a
  predefined idea of what constitutes an ABS framework. In the context of this
  indicator, the publication by a country of one or more ABS legislative,
  administrative and policy measure in the ABS Clearing-House would be
  considered progress by that country on having an ABS legislative,
  administrative and policy framework, and through the Online Reporting System
  on Compliance of the International Treaty in relation to plant genetic
  resources for food and agriculture.</p>

  <p>Regarding the number of SMTA, the data is the number of SMTA reported
  through the online system of the International Treaty (Easy-SMTA) for each
  country, while the actual number of SMTA issued (signed) could be higher, as
  all SMTAs signed may not be reported through the online system and therefore
  not recorded. SMTA is a private contract, therefore it is reported by users,
  not by a government focal point. Users have also a two-year period for
  reporting their SMTAs, and therefore the number reported for a specific year
  would be fixed in two years (may also change during the two years). </p>

COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>Sources of discrepancies:</p>

  <p>Reliability of the indicator is dependent on countries making information
  available to the ABS Clearing-House of the Nagoya Protocol and to the Online
  Reporting System on Compliance of the International Treaty on ABS legislative,
  administrative or policy measures.</p>

  <p>In addition to the information made available by countries to the ABS
  Clearing-House, the CBD Secretariat collects information from other sources:
  national biodiversity strategies and actions plans, national reports submitted
  under the CBD, the interim national reports on the implementation of the
  Nagoya Protocol (due in 2017) and official communications to the SCBD
  (responses to notifications, email communications, etc.). The information
  collected from these sources inform the Secretariat&#x2019;s inputs to other
  processes under the Protocol, in particular the consideration by the
  Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the
  Protocol (COP-MOP) of national reports (Article 29) and assessment and review
  (Article 31). The resulting information on the number of countries with ABS
  legislative, administrative or and policy measures may differ from the number
  of countries that have made available this information in the ABS
  Clearing-House. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>In addition to the information made available by countries to the Online
  Reporting System on Compliance of the International Treaty, FAO collects
  information from countries, submitted through their national reports, on
  conservation and use of PGRFA and their efforts in this regard for the
  preparation of the <em>State of the World&#x2019;s Plant Genetic Resources for
  Food and Agriculture</em>. </p>
