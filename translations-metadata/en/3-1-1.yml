  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal
  deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time
  period. It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live
  births and essentially captures the risk of death in a single pregnancy
  (proxied by a single live birth).</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>In the <em>International statistical classification of diseases and related
  health problems (ICD) </em>WHO defines the following:</p>

  <p><strong>Maternal death</strong>: The death of a woman while pregnant or
  within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and
  site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the
  pregnancy or its management (from direct or indirect obstetric death), but not
  from unintentional or incidental causes.</p>

  <p>A death occurring during pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium (also known
  as a <strong>pregnancy-related death</strong>): The death of a woman while
  pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the
  cause of death.</p>
UNIT_MEASURE: '<p>Maternal deaths per 100,000 live births</p>'
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>Maternal deaths are classified according to the <em>International
  statistical classification of diseases and related health problems</em> (ICD)
  definition. The specific codes used under ICD-10 (the 10<sup>th</sup> revision
  of the ICD) to define a maternal death are: O00-O96; O98, O99 and A34.</p>

  <p>ICD-11 (the 11th revision of the ICD) was adopted by the World Health
  Assembly in May 2019 and comes into effect on 1<sup>st</sup> January 2022.
  Further information is available at: <a
  href="http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/">www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/</a>
  The coding rules related to maternal mortality are being edited to fully match
  the new structure of ICD-11, but without changing the resulting statistics.
  The ICD-11 rules can be accessed in the reference guide of ICD-11, at <a
  href="https://icd.who.int">https://icd.who.int</a> . Forthcoming releases from
  2022 onwards will transition to use ICD-11 coding. Care has been taken to
  ensure that the definition of maternal death used for international comparison
  of mortality statistics remains stable over time, but the word
  &#x201C;unintentional&#x201D; has been used in the ICD-11 definition in place
  of the word &#x201C;accidental&#x201D; which was previously used, in
  ICD-10.</p>

COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The United Nations Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group (UN
  MMEIG) &#x2013; comprising WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, the World Bank Group and the
  United Nations Population Division (UNDESA/Population Division) maintains an
  input database consisting of maternal mortality data from civil registration,
  population-based surveys, surveillance systems, censuses, and other
  specialized studies/surveys. This database is updated before the release of
  every new round of estimates and is used to calculate the proportion of
  maternal deaths (PM) among women of reproductive age (WRA). The maternal
  mortality ratio (MMR) is then calculated as MMR = PM(D/B); where &quot;D&quot;
  is the number of all-cause deaths among women WRA and &quot;B&quot; is the
  number of live births. The number of live births is based upon the World
  Population Prospects published by UNDESA/Population Division. </p>

  <p>Statistical modelling is undertaken to generate comparable country,
  regional, and global level estimates. Adjustments are made according to the
  data source type (See Section 4e below). The analysis accounts for stochastic
  errors, sampling error in the data source, errors during data collection and
  processing, and other random error. The model&apos;s fit is assessed by
  cross-validation.</p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>The input datasets are updated prior to each new publication round of the
  maternal mortality ratio (MMR) estimates. Source data are collected by
  countries, typically annually for civil registration and vital statistics
  (CRVS) sources, every 3-5 years for specialized reviews, every 5-7 years for
  population-based surveys, and every 10 years for censuses. </p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>The maternal mortality estimates are updated approximately every 2-3
  years.</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>National-level data providers are typically statistical offices,
  specialized epidemiology monitoring authorities and/or Ministry of Health.</p>

  <p> </p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>World Health Organization (WHO) is the custodian UN agency for the maternal
  mortality ratio.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>All maternal mortality indicators include a point-estimate and an 80%
  uncertainty interval (UI). Both point-estimates and 80% UIs should be taken
  into account when assessing estimates.</p>

  <p>For example: &#x201C;The estimated 2020 global MMR is 223 (UI 202 to
  255).&#x201D;</p>

  <p>This means:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The point-estimate is 223 and the 80% uncertainty interval ranges 202 to 255.</li>
    <li>There is a 50% chance that the true 2020 global MMR lies above 223, and a 50% chance that the true value lies below 223.</li>
    <li>There is an 80% chance that the true 2020 global MMR lies between 202 and 255.</li>
    <li>There is still a 10% chance that the true 2020 global MMR lies above 255, and a 10% chance that the true value lies below 202.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Other accurate interpretations include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>We are 90% certain that the true 2020 global MMR is at least 202.</li>
    <li>We are 90% certain that the true 2020 global MMR is 255 or less.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The amount of data available for estimating an indicator and the quality of
  that data determine the width of an indicator&#x2019;s UI. As data
  availability and quality improve, the certainty increases that an
  indicator&#x2019;s true value lies close to the point-estimate.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The extent of maternal mortality in a population is essentially the
  combination of two factors:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The risk of death in a single pregnancy or a single live birth.</li>
    <li>The fertility level (i.e. the number of pregnancies or births that are experienced by women of reproductive age).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal
  deaths during a given time period per 100 000 live births during the same time
  period. It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live
  births and essentially captures (i) above.</p>

  <p>By contrast, the maternal mortality rate (MMRate) is calculated as the
  number of maternal deaths divided by person-years lived by women of
  reproductive age. The MMRate captures both the risk of maternal death per
  pregnancy or per total birth (live birth or stillbirth), and the level of
  fertility in the population. </p>

  <p>In addition to the MMR and the MMRate, it is possible to calculate the
  adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality for women in the population. An
  alternative measure of maternal mortality, the proportion of deaths among
  women of reproductive age that are due to maternal causes (PM), is calculated
  as the number of maternal deaths divided by the total deaths among women aged
  15&#x2013;49 years.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) can be calculated by dividing recorded
  (or estimated) maternal deaths by total recorded (or estimated) live births in
  the same period and multiplying by 100 000. Measurement requires information
  on pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within
  42 days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death.</p>

  <p>The MMR can be calculated directly from data collected through vital
  registration systems, household surveys or other sources. There are often data
  quality problems, particularly related to the underreporting and
  misclassification of maternal deaths. Therefore, data are often adjusted in
  order to take these data quality issues into account. Some countries undertake
  these adjustments or corrections as part of specialized/confidential enquiries
  or administrative efforts embedded within maternal mortality monitoring
  programmes.</p>

  <p><strong>Bayesian maternal mortality estimation model (the BMat
  model):</strong></p>

  <p>Estimation and projection of maternal mortality indicators are undertaken
  using the BMat model. This model is intended to ensure that the MMR estimation
  approach is consistent across all countries but remains flexible in that it is
  based on covariate-driven trends to inform estimates in countries or
  country-periods with limited information; captures observed trends in
  countries with longer time series of observations; and takes into account the
  differences in stochastic and sampling errors across observations.</p>

  <p>The model is summarized as follows:</p>

  <p><em>Estimation of HIV-related indirect maternal deaths:</em></p>

  <p>For countries with generalized HIV epidemics and high HIV prevalence,
  HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of death during pregnancy and post-delivery. There
  is also some evidence from community studies that women with HIV infection
  have a higher risk of maternal death, although this may be offset by lower
  fertility. If HIV is prevalent, there will also be more incidental HIV deaths
  among pregnant and postpartum women. When estimating maternal mortality in
  these countries, it is, thus, important to differentiate between incidental
  HIV deaths (non-maternal deaths) and HIV-related indirect maternal deaths
  (maternal deaths caused by the aggravating effects of pregnancy on HIV) among
  HIV-positive pregnant and postpartum women who have died (i.e. among all
  HIV-related deaths occurring during pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium).</p>

  <p>Where: </p>

  <p>a*E = the total number of HIV-related deaths among all deaths to women aged

  <p><em>v = </em>is the proportion of HIV-related deaths to women aged
  15&#x2013;49 that occur during pregnancy. The value of <em>v </em>can be
  computed as follows: <em>v </em>= <em>c k GFR / [</em>1 +
  <em>c</em>(<em>k-</em>1) <em>GFR] </em>where<strong> </strong>GFR is the
  general fertility rate, and where<em> c </em>is the average exposure time (in
  years) to the risk of pregnancy-related mortality per live birth (set equal to
  1 for this analysis), and where <em>k </em>is the relative risk of dying from
  AIDS for a pregnant versus a non-pregnant woman (reflecting both the decreased
  fertility of HIV-positive women and the increased mortality risk of
  HIV-positive pregnant women). The value of <em>k </em>was set at 0.3.</p>

  <p>u = is the fraction of pregnancy-related AIDS deaths assumed to be indirect
  maternal deaths. The United Nations Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency
  Group (UN MMEIG)/TAG reviewed available study data on AIDS deaths among
  pregnant women and recommended using <em>u = </em>0.3.</p>

  <p>For observed PMs, we assumed that the total reported maternal deaths are a
  combination of the proportion of reported non-HIV-related maternal deaths and
  the proportion of reported HIV-related (indirect) maternal deaths, where the
  latter is given by a*v for observations with a &#x201C;pregnancy-related
  death&#x201D; definition and a*v*u for observations with a &#x201C;maternal
  death&#x201D; definition.</p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>Estimates are reviewed with Member States through a World Health
  Organization (WHO) country consultation process and SDG focal points. In 2001,
  the WHO Executive Board endorsed a resolution (EB. 107.R8) seeking to
  &#x201C;establish a technical consultation process bringing together personnel
  and perspectives from Member States in different WHO regions&#x201D;. A key
  objective of this consultation process is &#x201C;to ensure that each Member
  State is consulted on the best data to be used&#x201D;. Since the process is
  an integral step in the overall estimation strategy, it is described here in
  brief.</p>

  <p>The country consultation process entails an exchange between WHO and
  technical focal person(s) in each country. It is carried out prior to the
  publication of estimates. During the consultation period, WHO invites focal
  person(s) to review input data sources, methods for estimation and the
  preliminary estimates. Focal person(s) are encouraged to submit additional
  data that may not have been taken into account in the preliminary
  estimates.</p>

  </p>

  <p>To summarise the key adjustments in brief:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Adjustments for variation in definitions of the input data:</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Previous studies found incidental or accidental deaths (comprise 10% of
  pregnancy-related deaths (excluding HIV-related deaths) in sub-Saharan African
  countries, and 15% in other low- and middle-income countries. Adjustments are
  applied to pregnancy-related deaths to account for these non-maternal
  deaths.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Adjustment for crisis years:</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The proportion of pregnancy-related deaths among the deaths attributable to
  mortality shock from crisis is assumed to be equal to the proportion of women
  in the population who are pregnant or postpartum at the time of the crisis.
  The proportion of pregnant women in the population is set equal to the general
  fertility rate, based on the assumption of a one-year period associated with a
  live birth. Additional uncertainty is added to the estimates of crisis
  years.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Adjustment for age distribution in population-based surveys:</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Population-based surveys such as Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and
  Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) obtain information by interviewing
  respondents about the survival of their siblings. This approach, commonly
  referred to as the direct sisterhood method. Given the study design (based on
  sisters of respondents), the population exposed to risk may be atypical of the
  population at large. Therefore, we compute an age-standardized value of PM,
  based on the female population of households at the time of the survey.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Adjustment for underreporting (unregistered) and misclassification in civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems:</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Underreporting and misclassification in CRVS systems are accounted for with
  specialized studies. Model estimated country-year specific adjustment factors
  are obtained and applied to CRVS data.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Adjustment for under-reporting in non-CRVS and non-specialised sources:</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It is widely believed that some form of upward adjustment is required for
  data sources that are not CRVS or specialised studies, to account for deaths
  early in pregnancy that might not have been captured. Therefore, an upwards
  adjustment of 10% was applied to maternal deaths that were not obtained from
  CRVS systems or specialized studies.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <ul>
    <li><strong>At country level</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Missing values are treated at the country-level. This is done as follows.
  There is no treatment of missing values at the regional level.</p>

  <p><strong>Predictor variable data:</strong></p>

  <p>Complete and comparable predictor data is obtained by constructing time

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>Current maternal mortality ratio (MMR) estimates are reported at national,
  regional, and global levels. Countries and territories included in the
  analyses are WHO Member States with populations over 100 000, plus two
  territories (Puerto Rico, and the occupied Palestinian Territory, including
  east Jerusalem).</p>

  <p>The <strong>time series</strong> available is currently 2000 to 2020.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>The maternal mortality ratio is defined as the number of maternal deaths
  divided by live births. However, to account for potential incompleteness of
  death recording in various data sources, the United Nations Maternal Mortality
  Estimation Inter-Agency Group (UN MMEIG) first computes the fraction of deaths
  due to maternal causes from original data sources (referred to as the
  &#x201C;proportion maternal&#x201D;, or PM), and then applies that fraction to
  WHO estimates of total deaths among women of reproductive age to obtain an
  estimate of the number of maternal deaths. </p>

  <p>In other words, the following fraction is first computed from country data
  sources:</p>

  <p>PM= Number of maternal deaths 15-49/All female deaths at ages 15-49 </p>

  <p>and then the PM is used to compute the MMR as follows:</p>

  <p>MMR=PM &#xD7; (All female deaths at ages 15-49/Number of live births)</p>

  <p>Where the estimate of all deaths at ages 15-49 in the second equation is
  derived from WHO Global Health Estimates life tables, and the number of live
  births is from the World Population Prospects 2019.</p>

  <p>With this as background, a few reasons that MMEIG estimates may differ from
  national statistics are as follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Civil registration and vital statistics systems are not always complete (i.e., they do not always capture 100% of all deaths) and completeness may change over time. The MMEIG estimation approach attempts to correct for this by using the above approach, which involves first computing the PM.</li>
    <li>The MMEIG often applies adjustment factors to the PM computed from original data to account for measurement issues (such as how the country defined &#x201C;maternal&#x201D; deaths; misclassification; or incompleteness). </li>
    <li>The MMEIG uses the standardized series of live births from the United Nations Population Division, as published in World Population Prospects 2022, in the denominator of the MMR equation. To better inform the WPP, countries should discuss discrepancies directly with the United Nations Population Division: the contact address is population@un.org; this email address is monitored regularly, and messages are dispatched to the appropriate analysts for each country or concern. </li>
    <li>Statistically speaking, maternal deaths are a relatively rare event, which can lead to noisy time trends in data over time. As the goal of the MMEIG estimates is to track long term progress in reducing maternal mortality, the estimation process involves some smoothing to generate a curve that better captures changes in underlying risk</li>
