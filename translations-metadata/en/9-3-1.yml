  <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>

  <p>Small-scale industrial enterprises, in the SDG framework also called
  &#x201C;small-scale industries&#x201D;, defined here for the purpose of
  statistical data collection and compilation refer to statistical units,
  generally enterprises, engaged in production of goods and services for market
  below a designated size class.</p>

  <p>Proportion of &#x201C;small-scale industries&#x201D; in total industry
  value added represents an indicator calculating the share of manufacturing
  value added of small-scale manufacturing enterprises in the total
  manufacturing value added.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>International recommendations for industrial statistics 2008 (IRIS 2008)
  (United Nations, 2011) define an <strong>enterprise</strong> as the smallest
  legal unit that constitutes an organizational unit producing goods or
  services. The enterprise is the basic statistical unit at which all
  information relating to its production activities and transactions, including
  financial and balance-sheet accounts, are maintained. It is also used for
  institutional sector classification in the 2008 System of National
  Accounts.</p>

  <p>An <strong>establishment</strong> is defined as an enterprise or part of an
  enterprise that is situated in a single location and in which only a single
  productive activity is carried out or in which the principal productive
  activity accounts for most of the value added. An establishment can be defined
  ideally as an economic unit that engages, under single ownership or control,
  that is, under a single legal entity, in one, or predominantly one, kind of
  economic activity at a single physical location. Mines, factories and
  workshops are examples. This ideal concept of an establishment is applicable
  to many of the situations encountered in industrial inquiries, particularly in
  manufacturing.</p>

  <p>Although the definition of an establishment allows for the possibility that
  there may be one or more secondary activities carried out in it, their
  magnitude should be small compared with that of the principal activity. If a
  secondary activity within an establishment is as important, or nearly as
  important, as the principal activity, then the unit is more like a local unit.
  It should be subdivided so that the secondary activity is treated as taking
  place within an establishment separate from the establishment in which the
  principal activity takes place.</p>

  <p>In the case of most <strong>small-sized businesses</strong>, the enterprise
  and the establishment will be identical. Some enterprises are large and
  complex with different kinds of economic activities undertaken at different
  locations. Such enterprises should be broken down into one or more
  establishments, provided that smaller and more homogeneous production units
  can be identified for which production data may be meaningfully compiled. </p>

  <p>As introduced in IRIS 2008 (United Nations, 2011), an <strong>economic
  activity</strong> is understood as referring to a process, that is, the
  combination of actions carried out by a certain entity that uses labor,
  capital, goods and services to produce specific products (goods and services).
  In general, industrial statistics reflect the characteristics and economic
  activities of units engaged in a class of industrial activities that are
  defined in terms of the International Standard Industrial Classification of
  All Economic Activities, Revision 4 (ISIC Rev.4) (United Nations, 2008) or
  International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities,
  Revision 3.1 (ISIC Rev. 3) (United Nations, 2002).</p>

  <p><strong>Total numbers of persons employed</strong> is defined as the total
  number of persons who work in or for the statistical unit, whether full-time
  or part-time, including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Working proprietors</li>
    <li>Active business partners</li>
    <li>Unpaid family workers</li>
    <li>Paid employees (for more details see United Nations, 2011).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The size of a statistical unit based on employment should be defined
  primarily in terms of the average number of persons employed in that unit
  during the reference period. If the average number of persons employed is not
  available, the total number of persons employed in a single period may be used
  as the size criterion. The size classification should consist of the following
  classes of the average number of persons employed: 1-9, 10-19, 20-49, 50-249,
  250 and more. This should be considered a minimum division of the overall
  range; more detailed classifications, where required, should be developed
  within this framework.</p>

  <p><strong>Value added</strong> cannot be directly observed from the
  accounting records of the units. It is derived as the difference between gross
  output or census output and intermediate consumption or census input (United
  Nations, 2011). The value added at basic prices is calculated as the
  difference between the gross output at basic prices and the intermediate
  consumption at purchasers&#x2019; prices. The valuation of value added closely
  corresponds to the valuation of gross output. If the output is valued at basic
  prices, then the valuation of value added is also at basic prices (the
  valuation of intermediate consumption is always at purchasers&#x2019;
  prices).</p>

  <p>All above mentioned terms are introduced to be in line with IRIS 2008
  (United Nations, 2011).</p>

SOURCE_TYPE: <p>National statistical offices (NSOs)</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>Countries were contacted to provide information on data availability for
  monitoring small-scale manufacturing enterprises. The data come mostly from
  annual industrial surveys, where value added is disaggregated by size classes
  given in terms of number of employees and from surveys focusing particularly
  on small enterprises, or small and medium enterprises in general.</p>
FREQ_COLL: '<p>Data are collected annually from NSOs, OECD and EUROSTAT.</p>'
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>UNIDO SDG-9 database is updated between March and April every year
  including the 9.3.1 indicator.</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>Data are collected primary from national sources, from official
  publications and official websites, and from OECD (Structural and Demographic
  Business Statistics) and EUROSTAT (Structural Business Statistics
  database).</p>
COMPILING_ORG: <p>United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>UNIDO, as the specialized UN agency on industrial development, has the
  international mandate for collecting, producing and disseminating
  internationally comparable industrial statistics. UNIDO&#x2019;s mandate
  covers (i) the maintenance and updating of international industrial statistics
  databases; (ii) methodological and analytical products based on statistical
  research and experience of maintaining internationally comparable statistics;
  (iii) contributions to the development and implementation of international
  statistical standards and methodology; and (iv) technical cooperation services
  to countries in the field of industrial statistics. With the repositioning of
  UNIDO as the focal agency for inclusive and sustainable industrial development
  (ISID), its statistical mandate was expanded to cover all dimensions of
  industrial development, including its inclusiveness and environmental
  sustainability.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Industrial enterprises are classified to small compared to large or medium
  for their distinct nature of economic organization, production capability,
  scale of investment and other economic characteristics. &#x201C;Small-scale
  industries&#x201D; can be run with a small amount of capital, relatively
  unskilled labor and using local materials. Despite their small contribution to
  total industrial output, their role in job creation, especially in developing
  countries is recognized to be significant where the scope of absorbing surplus
  labor force from traditional sectors such as agriculture or fishery is very
  high. &#x201C;Small-scale industries&#x201D; are capable of meeting domestic
  demand of basic consumer goods such as food, clothes, furniture, etc. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The main limitation of existing national data is varying size classes by
  country indicating that data are obtained from different target populations.
  Data of one country are not comparable to another. </p>

  <p>The definition of size class in many countries is tied up with the legal
  and policy framework of the country. It has implications on registration
  procedure, taxation and different waivers aimed to promote &#x201C;small-scale
  industries&#x201D;. Therefore, countries may agree on a common size class for
  compilation purposes. In this context, UNIDO proposes that all countries
  compile the employment and value-added data by a size class of
  &#x201C;small-scale industries&#x201D; as with less than 20 persons employed.
  From such data, an internationally comparable data on the share of
  &#x201C;small-scale industries&#x201D; in total could be derived.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The proportion of &#x201C;small-scale industries&#x201D; in total value
  added is an indicator calculated as a share of value added for small-scale
  manufacturing enterprises in total manufacturing value added:</p>
