  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator proportion of individuals using the Internet is defined as
  the proportion of individuals who used the Internet from any location in the
  last three months.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>The Internet is a worldwide public computer network. It provides access to
  a number of communication services including the World Wide Web and carries
  e-mail, news, entertainment and data files, irrespective of the device used
  (not assumed to be only via a computer - it may also be by mobile telephone,
  tablet, PDA, games machine, digital TV etc.). Access can be via a fixed or
  mobile network.</p>
UNIT_MEASURE: <p>Percent (%)</p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>For countries that collect this data on the proportion of individuals using
  the Internet through an official survey, and if data allow breakdown and
  disaggregation, the indicator can be broken down by region (urban/rural), by
  sex, by age group, by educational level (ISCED), by labour force status (ILO),
  and by occupation (ISCO). ITU collects data for all of these breakdowns from
  countries.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The indicator proportion of individuals using the Internet is based on an
  internationally agreed definition and methodology, which have been developed
  under the coordination of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU),
  through its Expert Groups and following an extensive consultation process with
  countries. It is also a core indicator of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for
  Development&apos;s Core List of Indicators, which has been endorsed by the UN
  Statistical Commission (last time in 2020). Data on individuals using the
  Internet are collected through an annual questionnaire that ITU sends to
  national statistical offices (NSO). In this questionnaire ITU collects
  absolute values. The percentages are calculated a-posteriori. The survey
  methodology is verified to ensure that it meets adequate statistical
  standards. The data are verified to ensure consistency with previous
  years&#x2019; data and situation of the country for other related indicators
  (ICT and economic).</p>

  <p>The percentage of individuals using the Internet data are based on
  methodologically sound household surveys conducted by national statistical
  agencies. If the NSO has not collected Internet user statistics, then ITU
  estimates the percentage of individuals using the Internet.</p>

  <p>Data are usually not adjusted, but discrepancies in the definition, age
  scope of individuals, reference period or the break in comparability between
  years are noted in a data note. For this reason, data are not always strictly
  comparable.</p>

  <p>Some countries conduct a household survey where the question on Internet
  use is included every year. For others, the frequency is every two or three
  years. </p>

  <p>ITU makes the indicator available for each year for 200 economies by using
  survey data and estimates for almost all countries of the world.</p>

INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>As the UN specialized agency for information and communication technology
  (ICTs), International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the official source for
  global ICT statistics, collecting ICT data from its Member States. </p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The Internet has become an increasingly important tool to access public
  information, which is a relevant means to protect fundamental freedoms. The
  number of Internet users has increased substantially over the last decade and
  access to the Internet has changed the way people live, communicate, work and
  do business. Internet uptake is a key indicator tracked by policy makers and
  others to measure the development of the information society and the growth of
  Internet content &#x2013; including user-generated content &#x2013; provides
  access to increasing amounts of information and services.</p>

  <p>Despite growth in networks, services and applications, information and
  communication technology (ICT) access and use is still far from equally
  distributed, and many people cannot yet benefit from the potential of the
  Internet. This indicator highlights the importance of Internet use as a
  development enabler and helps to measure the digital divide, which, if not
  properly addressed, will aggravate inequalities in all development domains.
  Classificatory variables for individuals using the Internet &#x2013;such as
  age, sex, education level or labour force status &#x2013; can help identify
  digital divides in individuals using the Internet. This information can
  contribute to the design of targeted policies to overcome those divides.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>While the data on the percentage of individuals using the Internet are very
  reliable for countries that have collected the data through official household
  surveys, they are less reliable in cases where the number of Internet users is
  estimated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). ITU is
  encouraging all countries to collect data on this indicator through official
  surveys and the number of countries with official data for this indicator is
  increasing.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>For countries that collect data on this indicator through an official
  survey, this indicator is calculated by dividing the total number of in-scope
  individuals using the Internet (from any location) in the last 3 months by the
  total number of in-scope individuals. For countries that have not carried out
  a survey, data are estimated (by ITU) based on the number of Internet
  subscriptions and other socioeconomic indicators (GNI per capita) and on the
  time series data.</p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>Data are submitted by Member States to International Telecommunication
  Union (ITU). ITU checks and validates the data, in consultation with the
  Member States. </p>
ADJUSTMENT: <p>No adjustments are made to the data submitted by countries.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>

  <p>In the absence of official household surveys, International
  Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimates the percentage of individuals using
  the Internet (Internet users as a percentage of total population) using
  various techniques, such as hot-deck imputation, regression models and time
  series forecast, using data such as income, education and other ICT
  indicators.</p>

  <p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>

  <p>In the absence of official household surveys, ITU estimates the percentage
  of individuals using the Internet (Internet users as a percentage of total
  population) using various techniques, such as hot-deck imputation, regression
  models and time series forecast, using data such as income, education and
  other ICT indicators.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Country-level data on the percentage of individuals using the Internet
  (Internet users as a percentage of total population) are first estimated using
  various techniques, such as hot-deck imputation, regression models and time
  series forecast. Hot-deck imputation uses data from countries with
  &#x201C;similar&#x201D; characteristics, such as GNI per capita and geographic
  location. In cases when it is not possible to find an adequate imputation
  based on similar cases, regression models based on a set of countries with
  relatively similar characteristics are applied.</p>

  <p>Once the country-level percentages are available for all countries, the
  number of Internet users are calculated by multiplying the percentages to the
  population of the country. The regional and world total Internet users were
  calculated by summing the country-level data. The aggregate percentages were
  calculated by dividing the regional totals by the population of respective
  groups.</p>

  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>Overall, the indicator is available for more than 130 countries at least
  from one survey.</p>

  <p>ITU makes the indicator available for each year for 200 economies by using
  survey data and estimates for almost all countries of the world.</p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>2000 onwards</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>For countries that collect this data on the proportion of individuals using
  the Internet through an official survey, and if data allow breakdown and
  disaggregation, the indicator can be broken down by region (geographic and/or
  urban/rural), by sex, by age group, by educational level, by labour force
  status, and by occupation. ITU collects data for all of these breakdowns from
  countries. Estimates of regional aggregates by sex are also calculated.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>Differences between global and national figures may arise when countries
  use a different definition than the one agreed internationally and used by
  ITU. Discrepancies may also arise in cases where the age scope of the surveys
  differs, or when the country only provides data for a certain age group and
  not the total population.</p>
