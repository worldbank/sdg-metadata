  <p><strong>Definition</strong><br>Total funding from government (central,
  regional, local), private sources (household, corporate &amp; sponsorship and
  international sources) in the preservation, protection and conservation of
  cultural and/or natural heritage for a given year per capita. The results
  should be express in Purchasing Power Parities (PPP) in constant $. </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Cultural heritage:</strong> includes artefacts, monuments, a group
  of buildings and sites, museums that have a diversity of values including
  symbolic, historic, artistic, aesthetic, ethnological or anthropological,
  scientific and social significance. It includes tangible heritage (movable,
  immobile and underwater), intangible heritage (ICH) embedded into cultural,
  and natural heritage artefacts, sites or monuments. The definition excludes
  ICH related to other cultural domains such as festivals, celebration etc. It
  covers industrial heritage and cave paintings. Mixed heritage that refer to
  sites containing elements of both natural and cultural significance are
  including in cultural heritage.</p>

  <p><strong>Natural heritage</strong>: refers to natural features, geological
  and physiographical formations and delineated areas that constitute the
  habitat of threatened species of animals and plants and natural sites of value
  from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty. It includes
  private and publically protected natural areas, zoos, aquaria and botanical
  gardens, natural habitat, marine ecosystems, sanctuaries and reservoirs.</p>

  <p><strong>Conservation</strong> <strong>of cultural heritage</strong> refers
  to the measures taken to extend the life of cultural heritage while
  strengthening transmission of its significant heritage messages and values. In
  the domain of cultural property, the aim of conservation is to maintain the
  physical and cultural characteristics of the object to ensure that its value
  is not diminished and that it will outlive our limited time span.</p>

  <p><strong>Conservation of natural heritage</strong> refers to the protection,
  care, management and maintenance of ecosystems, habitats, wildlife species and
  populations, within or outside of their natural environments, in order to
  safeguard the natural conditions for their long-term permanence.</p>

  <p>The aim of<strong> Preservation </strong>is to obviate damage liable to be
  caused by environmental or accidental factors, which pose a threat in the
  immediate surroundings of the object to be conserved. Accordingly, preventive
  methods and measures are not usually applied directly but are designed to
  control the microclimatic conditions of the environment with the aim of
  eradicating harmful agents or elements, which may have a temporary or
  permanent influence on the deterioration of the object.</p>

  <p><strong>Protection</strong>: is the act or process of applying measures
  designed to affect the physical condition of a property by defending or
  guarding it from deterioration, loss or attack, or to cover or shield the
  property from danger or injury. In the case of buildings and structures, such
  treatment is generally of a temporary nature and anticipates future historic
  preservation treatment; in the case of archaeological sites, the protective
  measure may be temporary or permanent.</p>

  <p><strong>Public expenditure</strong> refers to spending on heritage incurred
  by public funds. Public funds are state, regional and local government bodies
  (Adapted from OECD glossary). Expenditure that is not directly related to
  cultural and natural heritage is, in principle, not included. Public
  expenditure in the preservation, protection and conservation of national
  cultural and/or natural heritage covers direct expenditure (including
  subsides), transfers and indirect public expenditures including tax
  incentives.</p>

  <p><strong>Direct public expenditure</strong> includes subsidies, grants and
  awards. Direct expenditure comprises generally spent on personnel, goods and
  services, capital investment and other heritage activities. </p>

  <p><strong>A Transfer </strong>is a transaction in which one institutional
  unit provides a good, service, or asset to another unit without receiving from
  the latter any good, service, or asset in return as a direct counterpart (IMF,
  2014). </p>

  <p><strong>Net Intergovernmental transfers </strong>are net transfers of funds
  designated for heritage activities from one level of government to
  another.</p>

  <p><strong>Indirect public expenditures</strong> include tax
  incentives&#x2013; reduction of taxable income that arises due to several of
  heritage expenses incurred by a taxpayer<strong>.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>National/Federal level </strong>consists of the institutional units
  of central government and non-market institutions controlled by central
  government. Central government expends their authority over the entire
  territory of country. It is responsible for providing heritage services for
  the benefit of the community as a whole, but also it may make transfers to
  other institutional units, as well levels of government.</p>

  <p><strong>Regional/State/Provincial level </strong>is a subdivision of
  government, which shares political, fiscal and economic power with central
  government. In federal government, regional level is represented by state
  government. In unitary states, regional government is known as a provincial
  government. This level of government consists of institutional units, which
  have some of the functions of government at a level below of that of central
  government and above the local level. A regional government usually has the
  fiscal authority to raise taxes within its territory and has the ability to
  spend at least some of its income according to its own policies, and appoint
  or elect its own officers.</p>

  <p>If a regional unit is fully dependent on funds from the central government
  and a central government determines those funds, expenditures on regional
  level should be treated as a part of central government for statistical
  purposes.</p>

  <p><strong>Local/municipal level </strong>is a public administration that
  exists at the lowest administration level within government state such as
  municipality of district. Local level refers to local government units, which
  consist of local government institutional units and nonmarket institutions
  controlled by local level. A local government often has the fiscal authority
  to raise taxes within its territory and should have the ability to spend at
  least some of its income according to its own policies, and appoint or elect
  its own officers.</p>

  <p><strong>Total Public expenditure on heritage </strong>is consolidated
  expenditure on heritage made by national/federal, regional/States/Provincial
  and local governments. </p>

  <p><strong>Private heritage expenditure </strong>refers to privately funded
  preservation, protection and conservation of national cultural and/or natural
  heritage and includes, but is not limited to: donations in kind, private
  non-profit sector and sponsorship. Private funding includes donations by
  individual and legal entities, donations by bilateral and multilateral funds
  such as Official Development Aid (ODA), income from admissions/selling
  services and goods to individual and legal entities and corporate
  sponsorship.</p>

  <p><strong>Donation</strong> refers to cash and gifts-in-kind given by a
  physical or legal entity. Donations can be in the form of cash and in kind
  donations. Cash donations refer to the gift in money, payment checks or other
  monetary equivalents. Gifts-in-kind donations refer to donations in goods,
  services or other things such as supplies. Donations can be conditional or
  unconditional. Conditional donations are limited by the conditions imposed by
  the donor. Unconditional donations refer to the gift, which has no concrete
  purpose, given to organization/institution in order to help them in
  realization of their mission.</p>

  <p><strong>Donations by individuals</strong> refer to cash and in kind
  donation given by individual or physical person. </p>

  <p><strong>Donations by legal entity </strong>(corporation, enterprises) refer
  to any cash or in kind contributions given as a gift by legal entity &#x2013;
  corporation, enterprises etc. This kind of donation is also known as a
  corporate philanthropy charitable giving to any organization/institution. </p>

  <p><strong>Corporate sponsorships</strong> refer to financial or in kind
  contribution by business sector in exchange for benefits in the form of
  advertising, reputation, promotion etc. Corporate sponsorships represent some
  kind of marketing in which corporation pays to programme/project/event in
  exchange for some marketing benefits. </p>

  <p><strong>Income from admissions/membership fees/ selling services and goods
  </strong>refers to amount of money received by entree sales to households /
  membership fees or selling services and goods to households or legal entities.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Official Development </strong>Aid refers to the flows of official
  financing administered with the promotion of the economic development and
  welfare of developing countries as the main objective, and which are
  concessional in character with a grant element of at least 25 percent (using a
  fixed 10 percent rate of discount). By convention, ODA flows comprise
  contributions of donor government agencies, at all levels, to developing
  countries (&#x201C;bilateral ODA&#x201D;) and to multilateral institutions.
  ODA receipts comprise disbursements by bilateral donors and multilateral
  institutions. Lending by export credit agencies&#x2014;with the pure purpose
  of export promotion is excluded. (OECD).</p>

  <p><strong>Donations by bilateral and multilateral</strong> sources refer to
  any cash and in kind contribution given to another organization as a gift by
  bilateral party (foreign states) or multilateral party (international body,
  organization, etc.). It can be in the form of development assistance or
  official development assistance or private international/foreign donation.
  Private bilateral/multilateral donation is financial aid given by private
  foundation from one foreign country or private foundations from several
  foreign countries. </p>

  <p><strong>Total heritage expenditure </strong>refers to private and public
  spending on conservation, protection and preservation of heritage. Total
  expenditure comprises public and private expenditure for natural and cultural
  heritage. Using the ISIC Rev. 4 classification, total heritage expenditure
  covers expenditures (public and private) for library and archives activities,
  museum activities and operation of historical sites and buildings as well
  resources invested in botanical and zoological gardens and nature reserve
  activities.<strong> </strong></p>

SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p><u>For public expenditure:</u></p>

  <p>At national level, ministries of finance, and/or ministries of culture,
  environment financial management systems are the source of government
  expenditure on culture. Data on expenditure by lower levels of government can
  be centralized or collected directly from local authorities.</p>

  <p>Household expenditure on culture is collected through general consumption
  expenditure surveys or dedicated cultural participation and consumption
  surveys.</p>

  <p><u>For private expenditure:</u></p>

  <p>Data on other private sources of funding for heritage such (e.g. corporate
  sponsorship and philanthropy; private donations) are rarely collected
  systematically and would often require additional surveys proceeded by
  significant analytical, preparatory and advocacy work.</p>

  <p>International sources may be available through governmental financial
  systems when they are recorded on-budget, and off-budget international funding
  may sometimes be available through governmental aid management systems,
  although rarely with the disaggregation needed (ex. For heritage only). Data
  sources for international funding, such as the Official Development Aid data
  from the OECD-DAC database may be used as a complement, but often present
  problems of compatibility with other sources, such as government records. </p>

  <p>The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) is the statistical branch of the

  fields of education, science, culture and communication for countries at all
  stages of development.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>This indicator measures the per capita expenditure (public and private) in
  the preservation, protection and conservation of cultural and/or natural
  heritage over time. To monitor change over time of national efforts for the
  protection and safeguard of cultural and/or natural heritage.</p>

  <p>This indicator illustrates how financial efforts/actions made by public
  authorities, both at the local, national and international levels, alone or in
  partnership with civil society organizations (CSO) and the private sector, to
  protect and safeguard the world&#x2019;s cultural and natural heritage has a
  direct impact in making cities and human settlements more sustainable. This
  means that cultural resources and assets are safeguarded to keep attracting/to
  attract people (inhabitants, workers, tourists, etc.) and financial
  investments, to ultimately enhance the total amount of expenditure. This
  indicator is a proxy to measure the target. </p>

  <p>This indicator would allow insight into whether or not countries are
  strengthening their efforts into safeguarding their cultural and natural
  heritage. It will help to identify areas that require more attention for
  policy purposes.</p>

  <p>Expressing the indicator in PPP$ allows for comparison between countries
  and using constant values when looking at time-series is necessary to evaluate
  how real (eliminating the effects of inflation) resources evolve over
  time.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>1) In general, the availability of public expenditure data for heritage
  varies between countries.</p>

  <p>2) In general, the availability of private expenditure data for heritage is
  significantly lower so that it will take several years, capacity building, and
  financial investment in order to increase coverage to an acceptable level.
  </p>

  <p>This indicator comprises public and private monetary investments in
  heritage. It does not measure non-monetary factors such as national
  regulations or national/local policies for the preservation, protection and
  conservation of national cultural and/or natural heritage including World
  Heritage. These policies could take the form of fiscal incentives such as tax
  benefits for donations or sponsorships.</p>

  <p>International definitions and concepts that will support the harmonization
  of the data and indicators for cultural and natural heritage will be defined
  according to the 2009 UNESCO Framework for cultural statistics.</p>

  <p>The use of existing international classifications such as the
  Classification of the Function of the Government (COFOG) could be used. </p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The indicator is calculated by dividing total public funding in heritage
  (i.e. including transfers paid but excluding transfers received) from
  government (central, regional, local) and the total of private funding from
  households, other private sources such as donations, sponsorships or
  international sources in a given year by the number of inhabitants and by the
  PPP$ conversion factor.</p>

  data processing tools to facilitate processing of data and ensure the quality
  of data.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>All data collected will be reviewed by UIS for accuracy and quality.</p>

  <p>The process for quality assurance includes review of survey documentation,
  making sure compliance with international standards (for example the 2009
  UNESCO FCS, COFOG, ISIC), calculation of measures of reliability, and
  examining the consistency and coherence within the data set as well as with
  the time series of data and the resulting indicators examination of
  consistency of indicator values derived from different sources and, if
  necessary, consultation with data providers.</p>

  <p>Before its annual data release and addition to the global SDG Indicators
  Database, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics submits all indicator values and
  notes on methodology to SDG focal points, National Statistical Offices,
  Ministries of culture or other relevant agencies in individual countries for
  their review and validation.</p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>The data should comply with the definitions and guidelines provided
  international and comprehensive coverage of public and private expenditure on
  cultural and natural heritage </p>

  <p>Criteria for quality assessment include: data sources must include proper
  documentation; data values shall be nationally representative and, if not,
  should be footnoted; data are plausible and based on trends and consistency
  with previously published/reported values for the indicator.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>For the first data collection on SDG 11.4.1 in 2020, 50 countries
  representing 24% of all countries worldwide completed the UIS questionnaire.
  Due to lack of available data, less than 30 were able to calculate the
  indicator fully or partially.</p>

  <p>The availability of private expenditure on heritage is limited.</p>

  <p>If further disaggregation is not available at national level, the
  identification of cultural and natural heritage using the COFOG classification
  in public Finance statistics is not always straightforward. This explains why
  some countries were not able to report the relevant data to calculate SDG
  11.4.1.</p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>Annual data collection as of 2020.</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>Disaggregated by source of funding (public, private) <br>Disaggregated by
  type of heritage (cultural, natural)<br>Disaggregated by type of level of
  government (national, regional and local/municipal)</p>

  <p>Quantifiable derivatives (1). Comparison of the relative expenditures in
  heritage with GDP per capita of countries, which will provide a complementary
  measure of a nation&#x2019;s capacities and levels of development.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>There are no differences in the underlying data. Difference may occur due
  to the use of difference data for population data used to calculate
  indicators.</p>
