  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>Number of victims of violent crime in the previous 12 months who reported
  their victimization to competent authorities or other officially recognized
  conflict resolution mechanisms, as a percentage of all victims of violent
  crime in the previous 12 months</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>Competent authorities includes police, prosecutors or other authorities
  with competencies to investigate relevant crimes, while &#x2018;other
  officially recognized conflict resolution mechanisms&#xB4; may include a
  variety of institutions with a role in the informal justice or dispute
  resolution process (e.g. tribal or religious leaders, village elders,
  community leaders), provided their role is officially recognized by state
  authorities</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Victimisation surveys provide direct information on this indicator, as they
  collect information on the experience of violent crime and on whether the
  victim has reported it to competent authorities.</p>

  <p>UNODC collects data on reporting rates for violent crime through its annual
  data collection (UN-CTS). The data collection through the UN-CTS is
  facilitated by a network of over 130 national Focal Points appointed by
  responsible authorities.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>There is a consolidated system of annual data collection on crime and
  criminal justice (UN- Crime Trends Survey, UN-CTS) which represents the basis
  of data on intentional homicide, criminal justice outputs, penitentiary
  statistics and prevalence of victimization. The UN-CTS data collection is
  largely based on the network of national Focal Points, which are
  institutions/officials appointed by countries and have the technical capacity
  and role to produce data on crime and criminal justice (around 130 appointed
  Focal Points as of 2016).</p>

  <p>The UN-CTS collects data on reporting rate by victims respectively of
  &#x201C;physical assault&#x201D; and &#x201C;sexual assault&#x201D;. The
  current data collection is currently reviewed to collect data on this
  indicator.</p>

  <p>Data for SDG monitoring will be sent to countries for consultation prior to
  publication </p>

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Reporting to competent authorities is the first step for crime victims to
  seek justice: if competent authorities are not alerted they are not in a
  condition to conduct proper investigations and administer justice. However,
  lack of trust and confidence in the ability of the police or other authorities
  to provide effective redress, or objective and subjective difficulties in
  accessing them, can influence negatively the reporting behaviour of crime
  victims. As such, reporting rates provide a direct measure of the confidence
  of victims of crime in the ability of the police or other authorities to
  provide assistance and bring perpetrators to justice. Reporting rates provide
  also a measure of the &#x2018;dark figure&#x2019; of crime, that is the
  proportion of crimes not reported to the police. Trends in reporting rates of
  violent crime can be used to monitor public trust and confidence in competent
  authorities on the basis of actual behaviours and not perceptions.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The target relates to the multidimensional concepts of rule of law and
  access to justice and at least two indicators are required to cover the main
  elements of access to justice and efficiency of the justice system. The
  indicator 16.3.1 covers an important aspect of victim&#x2019;s access to
  criminal justice, while it doesn&#xB4;t cover civil or administrative
  disputes. The indicator as formulated is a standard indicator widely published
  when a victimization survey is undertaken, but further work is required to
  enhance a consistent interpretation and application of this indicator. In
  particular, some important elements of this indicator needs methodological
  guidance, such as the type of violent crime to include beyond physical
  assault; counting rules regarding reporting rates (e.g. prevalence-based,
  incidence-based, based on last victimization experience) and the type of
  competent authorities to consider.</p>

  <p>Methodological guidance on these issues is currently under development.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Number of victims of violent crime in the previous 12 months who reported
  their victimization to competent authorities or other officially recognized
  conflict resolution mechanisms, divided by the number of all victims of
  violent crime in the previous 12 months (also called the &#x2018;crime
  reporting rate&#x2019;)</p>

  <p>Both the number of victims of violent crime as well as the number of all
  victims of violent crime are measured through sample surveys of the general
  population, most often dedicated crime victimization surveys.</p>
