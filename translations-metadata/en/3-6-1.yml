  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Death rate due to road traffic injuries as defined as the number of road
  traffic fatal injury deaths per 100,000 population. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong> </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Numerator: Number of deaths due to road traffic crashes </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Absolute figure indicating the number of people who die as a result of a
  road traffic crash. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Denominator: Population (number of people by country) </p>
UNIT_MEASURE: <p>Rate per 100 000 population </p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>Road injuries are defined in terms of the International Classification of
  Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) (See Annex A of the WHO methods and data
  sources for global causes of death, 2000&#x2013;2019) </p>
SRC_TYPE_COLL_METHOD: ''
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>For the road traffic deaths we have two sources of data. Data from Global
  Status Report on Road Safety survey and Vital registration or certificate
  deaths data that WHO receive every year from member states (ministries of
  health). </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>For the population, we used data from the United Nations / Department of
  Economic and Social Affairs/ Population division. </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The methodology involved collecting data from a number of different sectors
  and stakeholders in each country is as follows. National Data Coordinators
  (NDCs), who were nominated by their governments, were trained in the project
  methodology. As representatives of their ministries, they were required to
  identify up to eight other road safety experts within their country from
  different sectors (e.g. health, police, transport, nongovernmental
  organizations and/or academia) and to facilitate a consensus meeting of these
  respondents. While each expert responded to the questionnaire based on their
  expertise, the consensus meeting facilitated by NDCs allowed for discussion of
  all responses, and the group used this discussion to agree on one final set of
  information that best represented their country&#x2019;s situation at the time
  (up to 2014, using the most recent data available). This was then submitted to
  the World Health Organization (WHO). More details are in the Global Status
  Report on Road Safety 2018 and the WHO methods and data sources for global
  causes of death, 2000&#x2013;2019. </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>WHO annually requests tabulated death registration data (including all
  causes of death) from Member States. Countries may submit annual
  cause-of-death statistics to WHO on an ongoing basis.</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: <p>End of 2020</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>The road traffic deaths data were provided nationally by mainly three
  ministries, namely, ministry of health, ministry of interior and ministry of
  transport.</p>
COMPILING_ORG: >-
  <p>WHO is the organization responsible for compilation and reporting on this
  indicator at the global level.</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>According to Article 64 of its constitution, WHO is mandated to request
  each Member State to provide statistics on mortality. Furthermore, the WHO
  Nomenclature Regulations of 1967 affirms the importance of compiling and
  publishing statistics of mortality and morbidity in comparable form. Member
  States started to report mortality data to WHO since the early fifties and
  this reporting activity is continuing until today. </p>
OTHER_METHOD: ''
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Road traffic injuries remain an important public health problem,
  particularly for low-income and middle-income countries.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>There are no vital registration data for all countries to make comparison
  against the data received on the survey. Also we cannot collect road traffic
  data every year using this methodology outlined in the Global status report.
  </p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The methods used for the analysis of causes of death depend on the type of
  data available from countries: </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>For countries with a high-quality vital registration system including
  information on cause of death, the vital registration that member states
  submit to the WHO Mortality Database were used, with adjustments where
  necessary, e.g. for under-reporting of deaths, unknown age and sex, and
  ill-defined causes of deaths. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>For countries without high-quality death registration data, cause of death
  estimates are calculated using other data, including household surveys with
  verbal autopsy, sample or sentinel registration systems, special studies.</p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>The number of deaths due to road injury were country consulted with country
  designated focal points (usually at the Ministry of Health or National
  Statistics Office) as part of the full set of causes of death prior to the
  release.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>Deaths of unknown sex were redistributed pro-rata within cause-age groups
  of known sexes, and then deaths of unknown age were redistributed pro-rata
  within cause-sex groups of known ages.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <ul>
    <li>At country level </li>
  </ul>

  <p> </p>

  <p>For countries with high-quality cause-of-death statistics,
  interpolation/extrapolation was done for missing country-years; for countries
  with only low-quality or no data on causes of death, modelling was used.

  <p>NA</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Country estimates of number of deaths by cause are summed to obtain
  regional and global aggregates.</p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>The cause of death categories (including road injury) follow the
  definitions in terms of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth
  Revision (ICD-10). Please see Annex Table A of the WHO methods and data
  sources for global causes of death, 2000&#x2013;2019
  (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/gho-documents/global-health-estimates/ghe2019_cod_methods.pdf)</p>
QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) established a Reference Group on Health
  Statistics in 2013 to provide advice on population health statistics to WHO
  with a focus on methodological and data issues related to the measurement of
  mortality and cause-of-death patterns. The group facilitated interaction
  between multilateral development institutions and other independent academic
  groups with WHO expert groups in specific subject areas including methods to
  the estimation on causes of death.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>The data principles of the World Health Organization (WHO) provide a
  foundation for continually reaffirming trust in WHO&#x2019;s information and
  evidence on public health. The five principles are designed to provide a
  framework for data governance for WHO. The principles are intended primarily
  for use by WHO staff across all parts of the Organization in order to help
  define the values and standards that govern how data that flows into, across
  and out of WHO is collected, processed, shared and used. These principles are
  made publicly available so that they may be used and referred to by Member
  States and non-state actors collaborating with WHO.</p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>All statements and claims made officially by WHO headquarters about
  population-level (country, regional, global) estimates of health status (e.g.
  mortality, incidence, prevalence, burden of disease), are cleared by the
  Department of Data and Analytics (DNA) through the executive clearance
  process. This includes the GATHER statement. GATHER promotes best practices in
  reporting health estimates using a checklist of 18 items that should be
  reported every time new global health estimates are published, including
  descriptions of input data and estimation methods. Developed by a working
  group convened by the World Health Organization, the guidelines aim to define
  and promote good practice in reporting health estimates.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p>Data availability:</p>

  <p>Almost 70 countries currently provide WHO with regular high-quality data on
  mortality by age, sex and causes of death, and another 58 countries submit
  data of lower quality. However, comprehensive cause-of-death estimates are
  calculated by WHO systematically for all of its Member States (with a certain
  population threshold) every 3 years. </p>

  <p>Time series:</p>

  <p>From 2000 to 2019</p>

  <p>Disaggregation:</p>

  <p>Sex, age group </p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>Sources of discrepancies:</p>

  <p>WHO&apos;s estimation of road traffic rates are, in many countries,
  different to the official estimates for the reasons described above that
  relate to our methodology. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>There are also differences in the data used for population between the
  national data and the estimates produced by the United Nations department of
  population. </p>
