  <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>

  <p>This metadata is focused only on the public service sub-component of
  indicator 16.7.1. It measures representation in the public service with
  respect to the sex, age, disability and population group status of public
  servants, and assesses how these correspond to the proportion of these groups
  in society as a whole. </p>

  <p>More specifically, this indicator measures the proportional representation
  of various demographic groups (women, youth, persons with disability, and
  nationally relevant population groups) across various occupational categories
  as well as across two administrative levels (national and sub-national).</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>This indicator builds on various concepts and terms from international
  statistical standards and classifications as well as normative frameworks:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>Institutional units covered:</em></strong><em> </em>The concepts of &#x2018;General Government Sector&#x2019; and &#x2018;General Government Employment&#x2019;<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4">[3]</a></sup>,<strong> </strong>as found in the 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA) but with some minor modifications<sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5">[4]</a></sup>, define the boundaries of the institutional units covered under this indicator. <ul>
        <li>The following institutional units should be included: All units of central and &#x201C;state&#x201D; (or equivalent sub-central level) government, i.e. all ministries, agencies, departments and non-profit institutions that are controlled by public authorities.</li>
        <li>The following institutional units should be excluded: local government units<sup><a href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6">[5]</a></sup>, the military, social security funds, public corporations and quasi-corporations that are owned and controlled by government units.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong><em>Administrative levels: </em></strong>As outlined above, this indicator covers employment at both central and sub-central levels of government (but excludes local government). Employment data will therefore be collected at two levels: <ul>
        <li>Employment in national/central government; and </li>
        <li>Employment in &#x2018;state government units&#x2019;, described in the 2008 SNA as &#x201C;institutional units whose fiscal, legislative and executive authority extends only over the individual &#x2018;states&#x2019; into which the country as a whole may be divided&#x201D;.<sup><a href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7">[6]</a></sup> </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong><em>Occupational categories in the public service: </em></strong>Target 16.7 calls for responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making <em>at all levels.</em> As such, reporting on indicator 16.7.1(b) needs to be done separately for various levels of decision-making. Since there is no international definition of &#x2018;positions&#x2019; in the public service and therefore most countries have their own national classification for public service positions, a harmonized set of occupational categories in the public service is needed to ensure the comparability of data reported for this indicator. <ul>
        <li>The International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-08) was used to identify four &#x2018;core&#x2019; occupational categories in the public service<sup><a href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8">[7]</a></sup> found to be relatively typical in every government, namely Managers (ISCO-08 Major Group 1), Professionals (ISCO-08 Major Group 2), Technicians and Associate Professionals (ISCO-08 Major Group 3) and Clerical Support Workers (ISCO-08 Major Group 4). </li>
        <li>Moreover, the rationale of this indicator places a particular focus on &#x2018;front-line service workers&#x2019; which frequently interact directly with the public,<sup><a href="#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9">[8]</a></sup> such as police personnel, education personnel, health personnel and front-desk administrative personnel. While this list of front-line public service jobs is not exhaustive, these four categories were selected given the substantial portion of public service jobs they account for, and the frequent direct interaction these public servants have with the public. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong><em>Appointed/elected positions:</em> </strong>In order to ensure consistent reporting, it is important to distinguish positions that are appointed (or elected) by the government or the head of government, and career public servant positions obtained on the basis of merit and seniority. This indicator only considers the latter &#x2013; i.e. positions held by career public servants, obtained on the basis of merit and seniority. NB: This consideration is most likely to affect positions in the &#x2018;managers&#x2019; occupational category. <sup><a href="#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10">[9]</a></sup> </li>
    <li><strong><em>Disability status:</em> </strong>To disaggregate public servant data by disability status, it is recommended that countries use the <a href="https://www.washingtongroup-disability.com/fileadmin/uploads/wg/Documents/Questions/Washington_Group_Questionnaire__1_-_WG_Short_Set_on_Functioning.pdf">Short Set of Questions on<strong> </strong>Disability<strong> </strong>elaborated by the Washington Group</a>.<sup><a href="#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11">[10]</a></sup> </li>
  </ul><div class="footnotes"><div><sup class="footnote-number"
  id="footnote-4">3</sup><p> It is important to note that data on general
  government employment is different from data on &#x2018;public sector
  employment&#x2019;, calculated under the International Labour Organisation
  (ILO) framework, which includes employment in public corporations (here to be
  excluded) <a href="#footnote-ref-4">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup
  class="footnote-number" id="footnote-5">4</sup><p> The following types of
  government employees are included in the SNA definition of general government,
  but excluded for the purposes of this indicator: local government units (see
  also next footnote for further detail), social security funds, military. <a
  href="#footnote-ref-5">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class="footnote-number"
  id="footnote-6">5</sup><p> Employment data from local government units should
  <em>not</em> be collected for reporting on indicator 16.7.1. Even though
  &#x2018;local government units&#x2019;, defined in the 2008 SNA as
  &#x201C;institutional units whose fiscal, legislative and executive authority
  extends over the smallest geographical areas distinguished for administrative
  and political purposes&#x201D;, are, in principle, part of the general
  government sector, this metadata does <em>not </em>require reporting on
  government employment at this administrative level. In order for local
  government units to be treated as institutional units, the 2008 SNA specifies
  that they &#x201C;must be entitled to own assets, raise funds and incur
  liabilities by borrowing on their own account; similarly, they must have some
  discretion over how such funds are spent. They should also be able to appoint
  their own officers, independently of external administrative control.&#x201D;
  Since this is not the case in all countries, global reporting on this
  indicator excludes this administrative level. <a

  id="footnote-7">6</sup><p> Such &#x2018;states&#x2019; may be described by
  different terms in different countries. In some countries, especially small
  countries, individual states and state governments may not exist. However, in
  large countries, especially those that have federal constitutions,
  considerable powers and responsibilities may be assigned to state
  governments.&#x201D; <a href="#footnote-ref-7">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup
  class="footnote-number" id="footnote-8">7</sup><p> ISCO-08 is a tool for
  organizing jobs into a clearly defined set of groups according to the tasks
  and duties undertaken in the job. It is the basis for many national occupation
  classifications and the standard for labour information worldwide. A job is
  defined in ISCO-08 as &#x201C;a set of tasks and duties performed, or meant to
  be performed, by one person, including for an employer or in
  self-employment&#x201D;. Occupation refers to the kind of work performed in a
  job. More specifically, the concept of occupation is defined in ISCO-08 as a
  &#x201C;set of jobs whose main tasks and duties are characterized by a high
  degree of similarity&#x201D;. <a
  href="#footnote-ref-8">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class="footnote-number"
  id="footnote-9">8</sup><p> Diverse representation among front-line service
  workers is important as it has been found to help raise the quality of public
  services by improving the understanding of community needs and ameliorating
  social dialogue and communication with the wider population. (OECD (2009),

  individuals from a certain disadvantaged population group) to leadership
  positions that change with elections is fundamentally different (and can be
  done much more quickly) from promoting women (or a disadvantaged population
  group) through the ranks to top positions in the public service. As such, if
  no distinction was made between appointed positions and career public
  servants, countries deciding to include only on appointed positions may appear
  more representative than countries reporting on career public servants. <a

  <p>International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) &#x2013; The
  indicator recommends the use of the classification to identify the four
  requested occupational categories in the public services. </p>

  the use of the institutional sector of economy definitions to identify and
  collect information on the institutional units covered in the indicator.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>There are no existing international datasets on the public service with the
  level of disaggregation required for this indicator i.e. first by
  administrative level &#x2013; national vs. sub-national, then by occupational
  category, and thirdly by socio-demographic characteristics. Data for this
  indicator must therefore be collected at the country level.</p>

  <p>The types of national data sources that provide information on the public
  service include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Surveys:</em> Very few countries carry out periodic employment surveys specifically focused on the public service. Generally, survey data on public service employment is a subset of more comprehensive employment datasets collected through other national surveys, such as labour force surveys, household surveys, surveys/censuses of economic establishments, etc. National population censuses are a better source in term of coverage and level of disaggregation, but they happen only every ten years. Given the level of disaggregation required for this indicator, it is unlikely that existing survey data will be sufficient to report on this indicator.<sup><a href="#footnote-12" id="footnote-ref-12">[11]</a></sup> </li>
    <li><em>Administrative records:</em> Centralized registries on public servants tend to be more precise (i.e. no sampling error), more up-to-date and more amenable to disaggregation than public service employment statistics derived from surveys. In most countries, several national institutions produce administrative records on public service employment. These typically include: </li>
    <li>A Public Service Commission (or related institution such as a Ministry of Public Administration or a Ministry of Finance) maintaining a centralized registry on the public service workforce <em>at the national/central level</em>; </li>
    <li>Another institution maintaining a similar registry on the public service workforce <em>at the sub-national level</em> (such as a Ministry of Local Government or of Municipal Affairs); </li>
    <li>A Police Services Commission or the like maintaining a centralized registry on police personnel; and</li>
    <li>A National Statistical Office (NSO) producing general government employment statistics from labour force survey data, or from administrative data submitted by the above-mentioned national institutions maintaining public service registers.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The most common and most comprehensive method for collecting public servant
  data is a Human Resource Management Information System (HRMIS), which is
  typically maintained by a Public Service Commission (or related institution
  such as a Ministry of Public Administration or a Ministry of Finance). Such
  systems have been found to produce the most robust data and to have the
  greatest potential for expansion on various dimensions of disaggregation.
  Since administrative data produced by a HRMIS is not considered
  &#x201C;official&#x201D; data in its raw form, it is recommended that the
  national institution maintaining a HRMIS collaborate with the NSO for the
  latter to provide the necessary quality assurance over the data produced by
  the public service body. </p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup

  to consult the ILO&#x2019;s &#x201C;Quick Guide on Sources and Uses of Labour
  Statistics&#x201D;, which reviews various sources that can be used to produce
  labour statistics, including labour force surveys and national account
  statistics. With regards to using administrative records, the ILO Guide notes
  that while such records &#x201C;were not designed for statistical purposes,
  they do have a significant underlying statistical potential, and can be used
  to produce statistics as a by-product.&#x201D; <a

  <p>NSOs should coordinate with primary data-producing entities at national and

  <ul>
    <li>Public Service Commissions (or responsible bodies producing public servant data) should submit all relevant data to the NSO. If a different institution produces public service data at sub-national level (such as a Ministry of Local Government or a Ministry of Municipal Affairs), this institution should submit all relevant data to the NSO.</li>
    <li>Similarly, if a different institution produces data on police personnel (such as a Police Services Commission or the like), this institution should also submit all relevant data to the NSO.</li>
    <li>NSOs, as the main coordinator of the national statistical system, should quality assure the content of the Data Reporting Form before submitting it for SDG reporting at the international level. </li>

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The public service is the bedrock of government &#x2013; where the
  development and implementation of public policies and programmes takes place
  and where society interacts with the government. In most countries, the public
  service is also the single largest employer. It is in this context that SDG
  16, under its target 16.7, encourages countries to ensure that the public
  service is representative of the people it serves &#x201C;at all
  levels&#x201D;.</p>

  <p>Indicator 16.7.1 focuses on proportional representation in public
  institutions; it measures the extent to which a country&#x2019;s public
  institutions are representative of the general population. Proportional
  representation (also known as &#x2018;descriptive representation&#x2019;) in
  the public service is concerned with the extent to which the composition of
  the public service mirrors the various socio-demographic groups in the
  national population. The underlying assumption is that when the public service
  reflects the social diversity of a nation, this may lead to greater legitimacy
  of the public service in the eyes of citizens, as public servants resemble the
  people they provide services to. Proportional representation has been found to
  be associated with higher levels of trust in public institutions, as people
  perceive more inclusive policymaking processes to improve the quality and
  fairness of policy decisions, and to help curb the undue influence of vested
  interests over decision-making.<sup><a href="#footnote-13"

  Trust.</em> <a href="#footnote-ref-13">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>Measuring representation: </em></strong>The significance of &#x2018;descriptive&#x2019; or &#x2018;proportional&#x2019; representation has been challenged in different ways:<ul>
        <li>There is the question of why be attentive to some groups (women, young people, minorities, etc.) but not others (the poor, LGBTI, &quot;ethnic&quot; groups who might not be officially recognized, etc.). Moreover, in countries whose populations are a mosaic of many diverse groups (some of which may account for less than 1 percent of the population), an exact reflection of such pluralism in the composition of the public service would be impossible and unnecessary. Finally, descriptive representation has the danger of ultimately becoming an end in itself. Concerns about effective representation should not end once the public service has the appropriate number of public servants representing each minority groups. These public servants should be able to articulate minority concerns and should have the same opportunities as others to have some influence on policy formulation and implementation. Nevertheless, if a public service includes none, or very few, women, young people or minorities, that is probably a worrying sign that the interests of these particular groups are not being heard. </li>
        <li>The age, sex, disability and population group status of individuals holding positions at various levels of decision-making in the public service provide an indication at the symbolic level of the way in which power is shared within an institution. However, there is no certainty that because a Manager is young (or old), a woman (or a man), or belongs to a minority group, s/he will bring to the fore issues of interest to groups with the same socio-demographic profile.</li>
        <li>Tracking the age of public servants offers some measure of youth representation in the public service. However, in most ministries and agencies constituting the public service around the world, leadership positions such as those falling in the category of &#x2018;Managers&#x2019; are considered senior functions which require considerable experience, and are awarded on the basis of seniority. This means that such positions are by nature unlikely to be held by individuals in the younger age brackets. As such, for positions falling in the category of &#x2018;Managers&#x2019;, more relevant insights will be generated on the basis of sex disaggregation, or disaggregation based on disability or population group status. </li>
        <li>Finally, governments use various ways to deliver public services, including through a range of partnerships with the private or not-for-profit sectors, and this indicator does not account for the staffing composition of other such entities which may have been contracted by the government to deliver public services. While in several countries, the large majority of health care providers, teachers and emergency workers are directly employed by the government, in others, public-private service delivery arrangements are in place, which means that many of these professionals are employed by organisations that are not state-owned, or by private contractors. Since this indicator does not account for the outsourcing of public service provision by the government, it may not give a complete picture of the representativeness of those who provide public services &#x2013; irrespective of who their employer is. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong><em>Rationale for computing ratios rather than proportions: </em></strong>It may be noted that the below computation methods lead to ratios rather than simple proportions. The rationale for this is simple: while a simple proportion of &#x2018;young&#x2019; public servants is not internationally comparable. For instance, 32% of &#x2018;young&#x2019; public servants (<a href="https://au.int/sites/default/files/treaties/7789-treaty-0033_-_african_youth_charter_e.pdf">34 years old or younger</a>) may be an over-representation of youth in country A where only 20% of the national population (above eligibility age for a public service job) falls in this age bracket (Ratio 3 = 38/20 = 1.6), but in country B where 40% of the national population is 34 years old or younger (and above eligibility age for a public service job), the same 32% would be interpreted as under-representation (Ratio = 32/40 = 0.8). In this example, the figure of 32% is not internationally comparable (it means over-representation in one country and under-representation in another), but the ratios 1.6 and 0.8 are internationally comparable. They help us understand whether 32% of public servants aged 34 years old or less is close to, or far from, proportional representation of this age group in the national population.<strong><em> </em></strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>Sensitivity of collecting disability and population group data in the public service: </em></strong>In certain contexts, population group status may prove to be a sensitive and politically charged variable. For example, several countries actively restrict or ban identification of ethnic or religious status, in order to protect vulnerable populations or discourage inter-ethnic conflict. In addition, definitions of groups that constitute a minority vary greatly between countries. Furthermore, there is a strong human rights principle that individuals must be able to choose to identify themselves as members of a minority, or not. It would not be appropriate for public service bodies (or any other body) to assume or to assign public servants a certain membership of a particular population group. As such, administrative data collection systems in the public service should allow public servants to self-report on membership of nationally relevant population groups. Similarly, discriminatory perceptions and implicit bias against disability can make the collection of data by public service bodies on this characteristic equally sensitive. This is partly because public servants with disabilities, like everyone else, have a right to privacy and therefore are not under an obligation to reveal a disability. Moreover, in many states, information concerning disability falls under the umbrella of health data and is therefore confidential, thus preventing public service bodies to release this information even on an anonymous basis.<sup><a href="#footnote-14" id="footnote-ref-14">[13]</a></sup> </li>
    <li><strong><em>Normative framework: </em></strong>The indicator calls for disaggregation of positions by age, sex, nationally relevant population groups and disability status. The following international human rights instruments contain provisions on enhancing opportunities for participation by individuals and groups holding such characteristics: <ul>
        <li><em>The universal right and opportunity to participate in public affairs: </em>Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) recognizes &#x201C;the right and opportunity, without distinction of any kind such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives&#x201D;. General Comment 25 of the Human Rights Committee elaborates that access to public service employment should be based on equal opportunity and general principles of merit, and that the provision of secured tenure would ensure that persons holding public service positions are free from political interference or pressures.</li>
        <li><em>Sex: </em>The 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) provides the basis for realizing equality between women and men through ensuring women&apos;s equal access to, and equal opportunities in, political and public life, including the right to participate in the formulation of government policy and the implementation thereof and to hold public office and perform all public functions at all levels of government (Article 7). States parties agree to take all appropriate measures to overcome historical discrimination against women and obstacles to women&#x2019;s participation in decision-making processes (Article 8), including legislation and temporary special measures (Article 4). The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action also call for women&#x2019;s equal access to public service jobs, by setting a target of a minimum of 30 percent of women in leadership positions.</li>
        <li><em>Age: </em>The 2015 Security Council Resolution 2250 urges Member States to consider ways to increase inclusive representation of <em>youth</em> in decision-making at all levels in local, national, regional and international institutions and mechanisms to prevent and resolve conflict and counter violent extremism. </li>
        <li><em>&#x2018;Population group&#x2019; status: </em>The Declaration on the Rights of Persons belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities (1992) and the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2007) provide that persons belonging to minorities and indigenous peoples have the right to participate in the political, economic, social and cultural life of the State. </li>
        <li><em>Disability status: </em>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006) calls upon State Parties to ensure that persons with disabilities can effectively and fully participate in political and public life on an equal basis with others. Under Article 31 of the Convention, State Parties commit to collecting disaggregated information, including statistical and research data to give effect to the Convention, and assume responsibility for the dissemination of these statistics. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong><em>Transposing national classifications of public service jobs into ISCO-08 based occupational categories for the public service: </em></strong>The ISCO-08 based occupational categories proposed above for this indicator are meant to be broad enough to accommodate considerable diversity among national classifications. When transposing their national classifications, countries should strive to respect the criteria listed for each occupational category and the references provided to specific ISCO-08 codes, while noting any divergence when reporting. A list of specific criteria is provided below to guide the transposition from national classifications to the ISCO-08-based occupational categories in the public service prioritized for this indicator. </li>

  <p>Indicator 16.7.1(b) aims to compare the proportion of various demographic
  groups (by sex, age, disability and population groups) represented in the
  public service, with the proportion of these same groups in the national
  population. More specifically, the proportional representation of these
  demographic groups is assessed across various occupational categories as well
  as across two administrative levels. </p>

  <p>When computing these proportions, all the considerations detailed above in
  the section &#x201C;concepts and definitions&#x201D; should be respected,
  including on institutional units covered, administrative levels, occupational
  categories and appointed/elected positions.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>An online SDG 16 Data Reporting Platform </em>(<a href="https://sdg16reporting.undp.org">https://sdg16reporting.undp.org</a> &#x2013; to be launched in April 2020) was developed by custodian agency UNDP to assist countries in reporting on this indicator, at the level of both national and sub-national government, and on the basis of sex, location (urban/rural), income or expenditure quintiles, age groups, nationally relevant population groups and disability status. Countries should use the online data forms and accompanying guidance provided on this platform to report on this indicator.<em> </em></li>
    <li><em>Countries are encouraged to report data that is available</em>, understanding that public servant disaggregated data for disability status and nationally-relevant population groups may not be currently available in many jurisdictions. Countries are encouraged to build additional capacities to disaggregate data by these demographic groups. </li>
    <li><em>Information for part-time positions should be given in full-time equivalents</em> and should be counted only for permanent posts actually filled. It is important to consider the part-time or full-time status of posts to address the risk that some target groups may be underemployed and over-reported (e.g. If women are more likely to receive part-time posts than full-time posts, there might be a false impression that women are equally represented in those posts, when in reality they work less than their male counterparts due to their part-time status). </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Global reporting on indicator 16.7.1(b) can be done in three steps: </p>

  <p><strong>Step 1 </strong>requires data producers to compile the raw numbers
  of personnel in the public service, disaggregated along administrative level,
  occupational categories, and the various demographic characteristics. The
  table below provides an illustration of how this &#x201C;raw&#x201D; data can
  be compiled. (NB: For ease of presentation, this table excludes
  &#x2018;total&#x2019; columns and rows, which data producers may wish to
  include).</p>

  <p><strong>Step 3 </strong>then requires generating ratios comparing the
  proportion of women, &#x2018;youth&#x2019;, persons with a disability, and
  specific population groups in the public service relative to the proportion of
  the same groups in the national population, across each occupational category,
  at both national and sub-national government levels</p>

  <p>The World Population Prospects database, published by the United Nations
  Population Division, provides official statistics collected from over 230
  national statistical offices on national population sizes disaggregated by age
  (groups) and sex. These statistics are required to calculate the denominators
  of the sex and age-related ratios.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that when comparing ratios of certain groups in the
  public service with corresponding shares of the same groups in the national
  population, it is important to use the working-age population of that group in
  the national population as a comparator i.e. above the minimum age required to
  apply for a public servant job, and below the mandatory retirement age for
  public servants<sup><a href="#footnote-15"
  id="footnote-ref-15">[14]</a></sup>. These lower and upper age boundaries will
  vary depending on the country, and need to be defined by each country in the
  below formula. For instance, if the minimum age to be eligible for a public
  service job in a given country is 18 years old, and the mandatory retirement
  age for public servants is 65 years old, then comparing public servants
  belonging to a particular population group (say, a particular ethnic group)
  with the corresponding share of this ethnic group in the national population,
  then it is important to focus only on those members of this ethnic group aged
  between 18 and 65. </p>

  <p>The resulting ratios can be interpreted as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>0, when there is no representation at all in the respective sub-category of the public service</li>
    <li>&lt;1, when the representation in the respective sub-category is lower in the public service than in the working-age population </li>
    <li>=1, when the representation in the respective sub-category is equal across the public service and the working-age population </li>
    <li>&gt;1, when the representation in the respective sub-category is higher in the public service than in the working-age population</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Prioritization:</strong></p>

  <p>Countries are expected to fill out the above table to the best of their
  ability, and to report as many representation ratios as possible, for women,
  &#x2018;youth&#x2019;, persons with a disability, and specific population
  groups, across all occupational categories, at both national and sub-national
  levels.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, global reporting on indicator 16.7.1(b) will focus on 4
  &#x2018;priority ratios&#x2019; (see cells highlighted in green in the table
  above), namely: </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ratios 1a) and b): Representation of female public servants &#x2018;overall&#x2019; (across all occupational categories) and representation of women in the &#x2018;Manager&#x2019; category </strong><em>(separate ratios for national and sub-national levels):</em> These two ratios are important because women remain significantly underrepresented in the public service across all regions, both in the public service as a whole and in the top levels of the public service (UNDP, Gender Equality in Public Administration &#x2013; GEPA, 2014). The target of a minimum of 30 percent of women in leadership positions, originally endorsed by ECOSOC in 1990 and reaffirmed in the Beijing Platform for Action in 1995, remains unmet in most countries. For instance, according to the Worldwide Index of Women as Public Sector Leaders developed (Ernst &amp; Young, 2013), across the G20 major economies, women represent less than 20 percent of public sector leadership. </li>
    <li><strong>Ratio 2: Representation of &#x2018;young&#x2019; public servants<em> </em>aged 34 and below across all occupational categories </strong><em>(separate ratios for national and sub-national levels):</em><strong> </strong>This ratio is important because in several countries, there is a significant age gap between those in public service and the people they serve (UNDP GEPA, 2014), which has been found to undermine young people&#x2019;s trust in public institutions (OECD, 2017). To remedy this situation, the UN Security Council has urged Member States to &#x201C;consider ways to increase inclusive representation of youth in decision-making at all levels in local, national, regional and international institutions&#x201D; (UN SC Resolution 2250, 2015).</li>
    <li><strong>Ratio 3: Representation of public servants with a disability across all occupational categories </strong><em>(separate ratios for national and sub-national levels): </em>This ratio is important because persons with disabilities remain significantly underrepresented in the public service, and under Article 31 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006), State Parties have committed to collecting disaggregated information to give effect to the Convention&#x2019;s call to ensure that persons with disabilities can effectively and fully participate in public life on an equal basis with others.</li>
    <li><strong>Ratio 4: Representation of public servants belonging to Population Group A (B,C,D, etc.) across all occupational categories </strong><em>(separate ratios for national and sub-national levels): </em>This ratio important because evidence shows that when public servants resemble the people they provide services to, with respect to their ethnic, linguistic or religious affiliations, or to their indigenous status, citizens perceive the public service to be more legitimate. Proportional representation of nationally-relevant population groups in the public service has been found to be associated with higher levels of public trust in public institutions.</li>
  </ul><div class="footnotes"><div><sup class="footnote-number"
  id="footnote-15">14</sup><p> In the event that a mandatory retirement age
  (MRA) has not been set for the public service specifically in a given country,
  the &#x201C;default retirement age&#x201D; (DRA) could be used as an
  alternative. The DRA applies to all employment in a given country, and
  &#x201C;is the minimum age at which employers can (if they choose to) set a
  mandatory retirement age, requiring employees to retire.&#x201D; If neither a
  MRA nor a DRA exist in a country, it is suggested to use the age of 65 as a
  ceiling, which is a common MRA across countries. <a

DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>The countries are requested to input the indicator in a reporting platform
  that provides separate fields for the metadata and statistics. By providing
  the metadata and statistics the custodian can identify possible
  inconsistencies and have further consultation with the national partner to
  validate the statistics provided. The fields used to comprehend/verify and
  validate refer to: the primary source of information; the excluded
  units<sup><a href="#footnote-16" id="footnote-ref-16">[15]</a></sup> and
  public servants<sup><a href="#footnote-17"
  id="footnote-ref-17">[16]</a></sup>; the corresponding grades and levels in
  the cases of countries that have not implemented ISCO-08; the
  inclusion/exclusion of appointed civil servants in the reported statistics;
  information and sources of disaggregation on sex, age and disability.
  Additionally, the reporting platform requests any additional methodological
  deviation that might exist between the collected statistics and the
  recommendations provided in the metadata. In addition to the metadata the
  countries are requested to input the nominator and denominator separately, as
  well as the disaggregated statistics, thus allowing to collect the information
  at a refined level.</p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup

  UNDP has dedicated staff to verify the collected data and liaise with the data

QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>It is recommended that NSOs serve as the main contact for compiling the
  necessary data to report on 16.7.1(b), in close coordination with relevant
  public service bodies in the country. This is to leverage and further
  consolidate the important quality assurance role played by NSOs in reviewing
  and &#x2018;vetting&#x2019; data produced by other parts of the national
  statistical system. It has been shown that official data sourced from NSOs
  tend to have more influence over policy analysis and decision-making at
  national level than other sources that have not gone through the appropriate
  vetting and quality assurance processes managed by NSOs.<sup><a

QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>The quality assessment is conducted based on the information provided in
  the reporting platform in an assessment of the metadata and statistics
  provided. When necessary and requested by the country the agency can support
  in designing a protocol for assessing the alignment of data produced with
  users&#x2019; needs, the compliance with guidelines in terms of computations,
  the timeliness of data production, the accessibility of statistics produced,
  the consistent use of methodology both in terms of geographic representation
  and through time, the coherence in terms of data production, and the
  architecture of data production. </p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>Most countries already have a Human Resource Management Information System
  (HRMIS) in place to track the composition of the public service. However, each
  HRMIS produces different types of data, using different definitions and
  different formats. This metadata file as well as additional guidance material
  provided by the custodian agency (UNDP) aims to facilitate harmonized
  reporting on this indicator. </p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>As mentioned throughout the above discussions, a three-way disaggregation
  of the data is recommended, along the following cumulative levels:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Administrative level<em> (central level; &#x201C;state&#x201D; level or equivalent)</em></li>
    <li>Occupational categories <em>(four ISCO-based categories, and select &#x201C;front-line service&#x201D; categories)</em></li>
    <li>Various demographic characteristics:<ul>
        <li>Sex <em>(male; female)</em></li>
        <li>Age group <em>(below 35 years; 35-44; 45-54; 55-64; 65 and above)</em></li>
        <li>Disability status <em>(disability; no disability)</em></li>
        <li>Population subgroup <em>(country-specific)<sup><a href="#footnote-19" id="footnote-ref-19">[18]</a></sup></em></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol><div class="footnotes"><div><sup class="footnote-number"
  id="footnote-19">18</sup><p> The population of a country is a mosaic of
  different population groups that can be identified according to racial,
  ethnic, language, indigenous or migration status, religious affiliation, or
  sexual orientation, amongst other characteristics. For the purpose of this
  indicator, particular focus is placed on minorities. <em>Minority groups are
  </em>groups that are numerically inferior to the rest of the population of a
  state, in a non-dominant position, whose members&#x2014;being nationals of the
  state&#x2014;possess ethnic, religious or linguistic characteristics differing
  from those of the rest of the population and show, even if only implicitly, a
  sense of solidarity directed towards preserving their culture, traditions,
  religion or language. While the nationality criterion included in the above
  definition has often been challenged, the requirement to be in a non-dominant
  position remains important (United Nations, 2010). Collecting public servant
  data disaggregated by population groups should be subject to the legality of
  compiling such data in a particular national context and to a careful
  assessment of the potential risks of collecting such data for the safety of
  respondents). <a href="#footnote-ref-19">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>
