  <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>

  <p>Proportion of population covered by a mobile network, broken down by
  technology, refers to the percentage of inhabitants living within range of a
  mobile-cellular signal, irrespective of whether or not they are mobile phone
  subscribers or users. This is calculated by dividing the number of inhabitants
  within range of a mobile-cellular signal by the total population and
  multiplying by 100.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator is based on where the population lives, and not where they
  work or go to school, etc. When there are multiple operators offering the
  service, the maximum population number covered should be reported. Coverage
  should refer to LTE and above (4G), broadband (3G) and any technology (2G)
  mobile-cellular technologies and include:</p>

  <p>- 2G mobile population coverage: refers to the percentage of inhabitants
  that are within range of at least a 2G mobile-cellular signal, irrespective of
  whether or not they are subscribers. This includes mobile-cellular
  technologies such as GPRS, CDMA2000 1x and most EDGE implementations. The
  indicator refers to the theoretical ability of subscribers to use
  non-broadband speed mobile data services, rather than the number of active
  users of such services. </p>

  <p>- 3G population coverage: refers to the percentage of inhabitants that are
  within range of at least a 3G mobile-cellular signal, irrespective of whether
  or not they are subscribers. This is calculated by dividing the number of
  inhabitants that are covered by at least a 3G mobile-cellular signal by the
  total population and multiplying by 100. It excludes people covered only by
  GPRS, EDGE or CDMA 1xRTT.</p>

  <p>- LTE population coverage: Refers to the percentage of inhabitants that
  live within range of LTE/LTE-Advanced, mobile WiMAX/WirelessMAN or other more
  advanced mobile-cellular networks, irrespective of whether or not they are
  subscribers. This is calculated by dividing the number of inhabitants that are
  covered by the previously mentioned mobile-cellular technologies by the total
  population and multiplying by 100. It excludes people covered only by HSPA,
  UMTS, EV-DO and previous 3G technologies, and also excludes fixed WiMAX
  coverage.</p>

  <p>As technologies evolve and as more and more countries will deploy and
  commercialize more advanced mobile-broadband networks (5G etc.), the indicator
  will include further breakdowns.</p>

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The percentage of the population covered by a mobile cellular network can
  be considered as a minimum indicator for Information and Communication
  Technology (ICT) access since it provides people with the possibility to
  subscribe to and use mobile-cellular services to communicate. Over the last
  decade, mobile-cellular networks have expanded rapidly and helped overcome
  very basic infrastructure barriers that existed when fixed-telephone networks
  &#x2013; often limited to urban and highly populated areas - were the dominant
  telecommunication infrastructure.</p>

  <p>While 2G (narrowband) mobile-cellular networks offer limited (and mainly
  voice-based) services, higher-speed networks (3G and LTE) provide increasingly
  high-speed, reliable and high-quality access to the Internet and its
  increasing amount of information, content, services, and applications. Mobile
  networks are therefore essential to overcoming infrastructure barriers,
  helping people join the information society and benefit from the potential of
  ICTs, in particular in least developed countries.</p>

  <p>The indicator highlights the importance of mobile networks in providing
  basic, as well as advanced communication services and will help design
  targeted policies to overcome remaining infrastructure barriers, and address
  the digital divide. Many governments track this indicator and have set
  specific targets in terms of the mobile population coverage (by technology)
  that operators must achieve.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Some countries have difficulty calculating overall mobile-cellular
  population coverage. In some cases, data refer only to the operator with the
  largest coverage, and this may understate the true coverage.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The indicator percentage of the population covered by a mobile network,
  broken down by technology, refers to the percentage of inhabitants living
  within range of a mobile-cellular signal, irrespective of whether or not they
  are mobile phone subscribers or users. This is calculated by dividing the
  number of inhabitants within range of a mobile-cellular signal by the total
  population and multiplying by 100.</p>

  <p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>

  <p>Missing values are estimated using data published by mobile cellular
  operators that have the largest market share.</p>

  <p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>

  <p>Missing values are estimated using data published by mobile cellular
  operators that have the largest market share.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Global and regional estimates are produced using weighted country-level
  data. First, the missing country-level data are estimated using data of the
  dominant mobile operator. Once all the country-level percentages are
  available, the number of people covered by the mobile signal is calculated by
  multiplying the percentage of population covered by the signal to the
  population of the country. The regional and world total population covered by
  a signal were calculated by summing the country-level data. The aggregate
  percentages were calculated by dividing the regional totals by the population
  of respective groups.</p>
