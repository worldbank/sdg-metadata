  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The percentage of youth and adults in a given age range (e.g. 15-24 years,
  25-64 years, etc.) participating in formal or non-formal education or training
  in a given time period (e.g. last 12 months).</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>Formal education and training is defined as education provided by the
  system of schools, colleges, universities and other formal educational
  institutions that normally constitutes a continuous &#x2018;ladder&#x2019; of
  full-time education for children and young people, generally beginning at the
  age of 5 to 7 and continuing to up to 20 or 25 years old. In some countries,
  the upper parts of this &#x2018;ladder&#x2019; are organized programmes of
  joint part-time employment and part-time participation in the regular school
  and university system.</p>

  <p>Non-formal education and training is defined as any organized and sustained
  learning activities that do not correspond exactly to the above definition of
  formal education. Non-formal education may therefore take place both within
  and outside educational institutions and cater to people of all ages.
  Depending on national contexts, it may cover educational programmes to impart
  adult literacy, life-skills, work-skills, and general culture.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Administrative data from schools and other places of education and training
  or household survey data on participants in formal and non-formal education
  and training by single year of age; population censuses and surveys for
  population estimates by single year of age (if using administrative data on
  enrolment). </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>Data are collected from the respective organizations responsible for each
  survey. </p>
FREQ_COLL: <p>Various depending on survey and country.</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: <p>Various depending on survey and country.</p>
DATA_SOURCE: <p>Ministries of Education and /or National Statistical Offices.</p>
COMPILING_ORG: <p>UNESCO Institute for Statistics</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>To show the level of participation of youth and adults in education and
  training of all types. A high value indicates a large share of the population
  in the relevant age group is participating in formal and non-formal education
  and training.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Formal and non-formal education and training can be offered in a variety of
  settings including schools and universities, workplace environments and others
  and can have a variety of durations. Administrative data often capture only
  provision in formal settings such as schools and universities. Participation
  rates do not capture the intensity or quality of the provision nor the
  outcomes of the education and training on offer.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The number of people in selected age groups participating in formal or
  non-formal education or training is expressed as a percentage of the
  population of the same age.</p>

  <p>PRAGi = EAGi</p>

  <p>PAGi</p>

  <p>where:</p>

  <p>PRAGi = participation rate of the population in age group i in formal and
  non-formal education and training</p>

  <p>EAGi = enrolment of the population in age group i in formal and non-formal
  education and training</p>

  <p>PAGi = population in age group i</p>

  <p>i = 15-24, 15 and above, 25-64 etc.</p>
