  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> </p>

  <p>This indicator provides information on the number of fatal and non-fatal
  occupational injuries per 100,000 workers in the reference group during the
  reference period. It is a measure of the personal likelihood or risk of having
  a fatal or a non-fatal occupational injury for each worker in the reference
  group. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>The number of occupational injuries expressed per a given number of workers
  in the reference group is also known as the incidence rate of occupational
  injuries. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong> </p>

  <p>Definitions of the main concepts presented below are derived from the
  Resolution concerning statistics of occupational injuries (resulting from
  occupational accidents), adopted by the 16th International Conference of
  Labour Statisticians (ICLS) in 1998 </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Occupational accident: an unexpected and unplanned occurrence, including
  acts of violence, arising out of or in connection with work which results in
  one or more workers incurring a personal injury, disease or death.
  Occupational accidents are to be considered travel, transport or road traffic
  accidents in which workers are injured and which arise out of or in the course
  of work; that is, while engaged in an economic activity, or at work, or
  carrying out the business of the employer. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Occupational injury: any personal injury, disease or death resulting from
  an occupational accident. An occupational injury is different from an
  occupational disease, which comes as a result of an exposure over a period of
  time to risk factors linked to the work activity. Diseases are included only
  in cases where the disease arose as a direct result of an accident. An
  occupational injury can be fatal or non-fatal (and non-fatal injuries could
  entail the loss of workdays). </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Fatal occupational injury: an occupational injury leading to death within
  one year of the day of the occupational accident. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Case of occupational injury: the case of one worker incurring one or more
  occupational injuries as a result of one occupational accident. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Workers in the reference group: workers in the reference group refer to the
  average number of workers in the particular group under consideration and who
  are covered by the source of the statistics on occupational injuries (for
  example, those of a specific sex or in a specific economic activity,
  occupation, region, age group, or any combination of these, or those covered
  by a particular insurance scheme, accident notification systems, or household
  or establishment survey). </p>
UNIT_MEASURE: '<p>Ratio of cases per 100,000 workers</p>'
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>Migrant status is determined according to country of birth (native-born or
  foreign-born) or country of citizenship (citizen or non-citizen). </p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The recommended data sources are different types of administrative records,
  such as records of national systems for the notification of occupational
  injuries (labour inspection records and annual reports; insurance and
  compensation records, death registers), supplemented by household surveys
  (especially in order to cover informal sector enterprises and the
  self-employed) and/or establishment surveys. </p>

  <p>The metadata should clearly specify (i) whether the statistics relate to
  cases of occupational injury which have been reported (to an accident
  notification system or to an accident compensation scheme), compensated (by an
  accident insurance scheme) or identified in some other way (for example
  through a survey of households or establishments) and (ii) whether cases of
  occupational disease and cases of injury due to commuting accidents are
  excluded from the statistics, as recommended. </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The ILO Department of Statistics processes national household survey
  microdata sets in line with internationally agreed indicator concepts and
  definitions set forth by the International Conference of Labour Statisticians.
  For data that could not be obtained through this processing or directly from
  government websites, the ILO sends out an annual ILOSTAT questionnaire to all
  relevant agencies within each country (national statistical office, labour
  ministry, etc.) requesting the latest annual data and any revisions on
  numerous labour market topics and indicators, including many SDG indicators.

INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The ILO is the UN focal point for labour statistics. It sets international
  standards for labour statistics through the International Conference of Labour
  Statisticians. It also compiles and produces labour statistics with the goal
  of disseminating internationally comparable datasets and provides technical
  assistance and training to ILO Member States to support their efforts to
  produce high quality labour market data. </p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>This indicator provides valuable information that could be used to
  formulate policies and programmes for the prevention of occupational injuries,
  diseases and deaths. It could also be used to monitor the implementation of
  these programmes and to signal particular areas of increasing risk such as a
  particular occupation, industry or location. Although the principal objective
  of this indicator is to provide information for prevention purposes, it may be
  used for a number of other purposes, such as to identify the occupations and
  economic activities with the highest risk of occupational injuries; to detect
  changes in the pattern and occurrence of occupational injuries, so as to
  monitor improvements in safety and reveal any new areas of risk; to inform
  employers, employers&#x2019; organizations, workers and workers&#x2019;
  organizations of the risks associated with their work and workplaces, so that
  they can take an active part in their own safety; to evaluate the
  effectiveness of preventive measures; to estimate the consequences of
  occupational injuries, particularly in terms of days lost or costs; and to
  provide a basis for policymaking aimed at encouraging employers,
  employers&#x2019; organizations, workers and workers&#x2019; organizations to
  introduce accident prevention measures. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>There may be problems of underreporting of occupational injuries, and
  proper systems should be put in place to ensure the best reporting and data
  quality. Underreporting is thought to be present in countries at all levels of
  development but may be particularly problematic in some developing countries.
  Data users should be aware of this issue when analysing the data. Double
  counting of cases of occupational injury may also happen in cases where data
  from several registries (records kept by different agencies, for example) are
  consolidated to have more comprehensive statistics. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Because data quality issues may be present, it may be more relevant to
  analyse indicator trends rather than levels. When measured over a period of
  time, the data can reveal progress or deterioration in occupational safety and
  health, and thus point to the effectiveness of prevention measures. This
  indicator is volatile and strong annual fluctuations may occur due to
  unexpected but significant accidents or national calamities. The underlying
  trend should therefore be analysed. </p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The incidence rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries will be
  calculated separately, since statistics on fatal injuries tend to come from a
  different source than those on non-fatal injuries, which would make their sum
  into total occupational accidents inaccurate.</p>

  <p>The fatal occupational injury incidence rate is expressed per 100,000
  workers in the reference group, and thus, is calculated as follows:</p>

  <p>In calculating the average number of workers, the number of part-time
  workers should be converted to full-time equivalents. For the calculation of
  rates, the numerator and the denominator should have the same coverage. For
  example, if self-employed persons are not covered by the source of statistics
  on fatal occupational injuries, they should also be taken out of the
  denominator. </p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>The ILO engages in annual consultations with Member States through the
  ILOSTAT questionnaire and related Statistics Reporting System (StaRS).
  National data providers receive a link to the portal where they can review all
  national SDG data available on ILOSTAT.</p>

  <p>This indicator could come from a variety of sources at the national level,
  including various kinds of administrative records (insurance records, labour
  inspection records, etc.), household surveys and establishment surveys. </p>

QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>The processes of compilation, production, and publication of data,
  including its quality control, are carried out following the methodological
  framework and standards established by the ILO Department of Statistics, in
  compliance with the information technology and management standards of the
  ILO.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>Data consistency and quality checks are regularly conducted for validation
  of the data before dissemination in the ILOSTAT database. </p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>The final assessment of the quality of information is carried out by the
  Data Production and Analysis Unit of the ILO Department of Statistics. In
  cases of doubt about the quality of specific data, these values are reviewed
  with the participation of the national agencies responsible for producing the
  data if appropriate. If the issues cannot be clarified, the respective
  information is not published.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong> </p>

  <p>Data on fatal injuries per 100,000 workers is available for 97 countries
  and territories. Data on non-fatal injuries per 100,000 workers is available
  for 95 countries and territories.</p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong> </p>

  <p>The submission covers data from 2000 to 2021.</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>This indicator should be disaggregated by both sex and migrant status. </p>

  <p>Wherever possible, it would also be useful to have information
  disaggregated by economic activity and occupation. </p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>The variety of possible sources of data on occupational injuries hinders
  the comparability of data across countries since each type of source provides
  information on different specific concepts. Data derived from administrative
  records are not strictly comparable since they include numerous types of
  records that follow different rules and are maintained by different agencies.
  Two main sources of data are records of notifications by employers to the
  competent authority and insurance records of the authority compensating the
  victims. These two would clearly yield different results, since it is possible
  that not all injuries that were compensated to workers were reported by the
  employer and vice versa. It is also possible that these records have a
  different geographical coverage or that they cover different economic
  activities.</p>

  <p>When statistics come from an establishment survey, the results would be
  closer to those from records of notifications made by employers since it is
  also the employer who provides the establishment survey information. However,
  establishment surveys tend not to cover the informal sector, establishments of
  a very small size and sometimes the agricultural sector. </p>

  <p>When statistics come from a household survey, their reliability depends
  heavily on the accuracy of the respondents, who may be subjective in the
  information given. </p>
