  <h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>

  <h2>Definition:</h2>

  <p>Amount of water- and sanitation-related official development assistance
  that is part of a government-coordinated spending plan is defined as the
  proportion of total water and sanitation-related Official Development
  Assistance (ODA) disbursements that are included in the government budget.</p>

  <h2>Concepts:</h2>

  <p>&#x201C;International cooperation and capacity-building support&#x201D;
  implies aid (most of it quantifiable) in the form of grants or loans by
  external support agencies. The amount of water and sanitation-related Official
  Development Assistance (ODA) can be used as a proxy for this, captured by OECD
  Creditor Reporting System (CRS). ODA is defined as flows of official financing
  administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of
  developing countries as the main objective, and which are concessional in
  character with a grant element of at least 25 per cent (using a fixed 10 per
  cent rate of discount). By convention, ODA flows comprise contributions of
  donor government agencies, at all levels, to developing countries
  (&#x201C;bilateral ODA&#x201D;) and to multilateral institutions. ODA
  receipts, from a recipient perspective, comprise disbursements by bilateral
  donors and multilateral institutions. Lending by export credit
  agencies&#x2014;with the pure purpose of export promotion&#x2014;is excluded
  (see <a
  href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm">http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm</a>).</p>

  <p>&#x201C;Developing countries&#x201D; refer to countries, which are eligible
  to receive official development assistance (see <a
  href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/daclist.htm">http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/daclist.htm</a>).
  This limits the scope of reporting to those countries receiving water and
  sanitation ODA, and the number of such countries is expected to decrease going
  forward.</p>

  <p>Water and sanitation-related activities and programmes include those for
  water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) (targets 6.1, 6.2), wastewater and
  water quality (6.3), water efficiency (6.4), water resource management (6.5),
  and water-related ecosystems (6.6). As per target 6.a wording, it includes
  activities and programmes for water harvesting, desalination, water
  efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies. </p>

  <p>A government coordinated spending plan is defined as a financing
  plan/budget for the water and sanitation sector, clearly assessing the
  available sources of finance and strategies for financing future needs.</p>

  <h1>Data sources</h1>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

  <p>The UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and
  Drinking-Water (GLAAS) provides information on governance, monitoring, human
  resources, and financing in the water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sector.
  The UN-Water GLAAS survey is currently conducted on a biennial basis, led by
  WHO, and collected data from 94 countries (predominantly low and lower-middle
  income countries) in the most recent cycle in 2013-2014. The scope of the
  question on external funding has been expanded beyond WASH for the 2016-17
  GLAAS cycle to include wastewater and water quality, water efficiency, water
  resource management, and the status of water-related ecosystems. GLAAS has
  completed three full cycles (2009-2010, 2011-2012, and 2013-2014), as well as
  a pilot conducted in 2008. </p>

  <p>National governments participating in the GLAAS survey fill out the
  questionnaire, preferably supported by a multi-stakeholder review. Although
  one ministry leads the process, it is often the case that many different
  ministries and departments must be involved in the process in order to obtain
  the data required to complete the questionnaire. A GLAAS national focal person
  supports the lead ministry to coordinate data collection, to compile the
  national response to the questionnaire, and to lead on the process of data
  validation.</p>

  <p>The OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) has been collecting data on
  aid flows since 1973 through the OECD Creditor Reporting System based on a
  standard methodology and agreed definitions from member countries and other
  aid providers. The data are generally obtained on an activity level, and
  include numerous parameters to allow disaggregation by provider and recipient
  country, by type of finance, and by type of resources provided. Data are
  available for essentially all high-income countries as bilateral donors, and
  for an increasing number of middle-income aid providers, as well as
  multi-lateral lending institutions. Methodology on ODA data collection by OECD
  can be found here: <a
  href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm">http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm</a></p>

  <p>The data will be complemented by Integrated Water Resources Management
  (IWRM) reporting in SDG target 6.5 (for wastewater and water quality, water
  efficiency, water resource management, and the status of water-related
  ecosystems) (UNEP 2016). The analysis of IWRM has been done in the past by
  UN-Water in 2008 (led by UN-DESA) and in 2012 (led by UNEP, UNDP, GWP and
  SIWI) as requested by the UN Commission for Sustainable Development (UN-Water
  2008, 2012).</p>

  <h2>Collection process:</h2>

  <p>National governments participating in the UN-Water Global Analysis and
  Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) survey fill out the
  questionnaire, preferably supported by a multi-stakeholder review. Although
  one ministry leads the process (e.g. Ministry of Water, Ministry of
  Environment, etc. depending on country), it is often the case that many
  different ministries and departments must be involved in the process in order
  to obtain the data required to complete the questionnaire. A GLAAS national
  focal person supports the lead ministry to coordinate data collection, to
  compile the national response to the questionnaire, and to lead on the process
  of data validation. For each GLAAS submission, information on the country
  processes is collected (number of ministries involved, whether a national
  meeting was held to support the filling of the questionnaire, stakeholder
  validation, use of documentation, etc.). Once received, the country submission
  undergoes a thorough data validation process, which is often an iterative
  process requiring communication and feedback with regional and country
  counterparts.</p>

  <p>Countries are also requested to provide consent to publish individual,
  validated data responses as supplied to GLAAS. Thus through the data
  collection, validation and consultation processes, the results are expected to
  be comparable and no further adjustments are foreseen.</p>

RATIONALE: >-
  <h2>Rationale:</h2>

  <p>The amount of water and sanitation-related Official Development Assistance
  (ODA) is a quantifiable measurement as a proxy for &#x201C;international
  cooperation and capacity development support&#x201D; in financial terms. It is
  essential to be able to assess ODA in proportion with how much of it is
  included in the government budget to gain a better understanding of whether
  donors are aligned with national governments while highlighting total water
  and sanitation ODA disbursements to developing countries over time. </p>

  <p>A low value of this indicator (near 0%) would suggest that international
  donors are investing in water and sanitation related activities and programmes
  in the country outside the purview of the national government. A high value
  (near 100%) would indicate that donors are aligned with national government
  and national policies and plans for water and sanitation.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>

  <p>Data on water and sanitation-related ODA included in the government budget
  will be available by end-2016 with the current cycle of UN-Water Global
  Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) data. Until
  then, total water and sanitation-related ODA (denominator) will be reported.
  Total water and sanitation-related ODA will continue to be reported as an
  additional indicator going forward.</p>

  <p>In addition, the proportion of ODA channelled through the government
  treasury will be reported as an additional indicator. ODA channelled through
  treasury indicates a high level of cooperation and alignment between donors
  and national government in which the donors channel funds through the national
  budget process. </p>

  <p>The OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS) currently disaggregates ODA for
  the water and sanitation among several categories including: sector policy and
  administration, water resources protection, large and basic water and
  sanitation systems, river basin infrastructure, waste management, agricultural
  water resources, and education and training. While these categories do not
  align directly with the target areas of SDG 6 individually, which limits the
  disaggregation of ODA among the SDG target areas, the combined ODA from these
  categories does align with a majority of the reported ODA to the water
  sector.</p>

  <p>As the numerator and denominator come from different sources, there is the
  possibility of different underlying assumptions regarding what should be
  included/excluded in the ODA figures. This could lead to situations in which
  the proportion of ODA included in government budget is greater than 1 (100%)
  if total ODA reported to OECD is lower than ODA reported to be included the
  budget. To guard against this possibility, the OECD will supply GLAAS with the
  reported ODA figures, broken down to the project level, so that respondents
  can match these with their on-budget project data. </p>

  <p>ODA represents only one aspect of international cooperation. To capture
  other dimensions, additional supporting indicators are available, including
  indicators for the Collaborative Behaviours identified by the Sanitation and
  Water for All (SWA) partnership. Each behaviour has one or two key indicators
  for governments and for development partners. If the behaviours are jointly
  adapted by governments and development partners, long-term sector performance
  and sustainability would improve. For additional information on the
  Collaborative Behaviours see: <a
  href="http://sanitationandwaterforall.org/about/the-four-swa-collaborative-behaviours/">http://sanitationandwaterforall.org/about/the-four-swa-collaborative-behaviours/</a></p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <h1>Methodology</h1>

  <h2>Computation method:</h2>

  <p>The indicator is computed as the proportion of total water and
  sanitation-related ODA that is included in the government budget, i.e. the
  amount of water and sanitation-related ODA in the government budget divided by
  the total amount of water and sanitation-related ODA.</p>

  <p>The numerator on water and sanitation-related ODA in the government budget
  will be obtained from the UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of
  Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) survey for the 2016-2017 cycle. The
  question on external funding collects data on the amount of donor funds that
  were included in government budget. Data for 2015 ODA disbursements through
  GLAAS will be available by end-2016. The scope of the question on external
  funding has been expanded beyond WASH for the 2016-17 cycle to address all
  targets under SDG 6, including wastewater and water quality, water efficiency,
  water resource management, and water-related ecosystems.</p>

  <p>The denominator on total water and sanitation-related ODA disbursements
  will be obtained through OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS) (purpose codes
  14000-series for the water sector and purpose code 31140 for agricultural
  water resources). Data on ODA disbursements for 2015 will be made available
  through CRS in December 2016.</p>

  <h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Due to the highly country- and context-specific nature of ODA disbursements
  and whether they are aligned with national government plans, no estimates are
  produced for countries that are missing data.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>At regional and global levels:</em></strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>If no data is provided for the amount of ODA included in the budget, then
  the country is excluded from the regional and/or global analysis.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <h2>Regional aggregates:</h2>

  <p>Global and regional aggregates for ODA are derived based on summation of
  recipient country ODA disbursement for the water sector (purpose codes 14000-
  series) and agricultural water resources (purpose code 31140) from the OECD
  Creditor Reporting System. </p>

  <p>Global and regional proportions of ODA disbursements as part of a
  government budget are derived for countries based on a summation of ODA for
  the water sector that is included in the budget divided by a summation of
  total ODA for water sector. The calculation of global and regional aggregates
  would only be performed for those countries reporting the amount of ODA for
  the water sector that is included in the budget. If no data is provided for
  the amount of ODA in the budget, then the country is excluded from the
  regional and/or global analysis.</p>

  The data included in the indicator are ODA flows from all donors to developing
  countries eligible for ODA for the water sector (water and sanitation (purpose
  codes 14000- series), agricultural water resources (purpose code 31140), flood
  prevention/control (purpose code 41050), and hydroelectric power plants
  (purpose code 23220)).</p>

QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <h2>Quality assurance:</h2>

  <p>Data are collected using a converged reporting system whereby bilateral and
  multilateral providers of development co-operation use a single file format
  (Creditor Reporting System &#x2013; CRS) to report at item level on all flows
  of resources to developing countries. Item-level reporting is validated
  against key aggregates also reported by donors and then serves as the basis
  for producing various other aggregate statistics. For further details, see: <a
  href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm">http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm</a>

  <p>A statistical reporter is responsible for the collection of DAC statistics
  in each providing country/agency. This reporter is usually located in the
  national aid agency, Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Finance etc.</p>

  <h2>Time series:</h2>

  <p>Time series of parameters under the indicator are available for 2008, 2010,
  2012, and 2014.</p>

  <h2>Disaggregation:</h2>

  <p>Subsector disaggregation (basic vs. large systems)</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>

  <p>There may be differences in how much development aid is reported by a
  recipient country and the amount of ODA disbursed to that country as reported
  by the OECD-CRS. While OECD captures a significant amount of the aid flows (as
  reported by external donors) to the water and sanitation sector, countries may
  receive development aid for water and sanitation from national and
  international donors that do not report to the OECD-CRS data system. Other
  differences may occur if recipient countries define development aid more or
  less rigorously than OECD&#x2019;s definition of ODA, or use different
  timeframes (e.g. fiscal year instead of calendar year) to report aid flows. In
  order to ensure data is as consistent as possible, the OECD will supply the
  reported ODA figures broken down to the project level, so that respondents can
  match these with their on-budget project data.</p>
