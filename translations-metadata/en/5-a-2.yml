  <p>Definition:</p>

  <p>Indicator 5.a.2 looks at the extent to which the legal framework (including
  customary law) guarantees women&#x2019;s equal rights to land ownership and/or
  control. </p>

  <p>The indicator &#x201C;measures&#x201D; the level to which a
  country&#x2019;s legal framework supports women&#x2019;s land rights, by
  testing that framework against six proxies drawn from international law and
  internationally accepted good practices , in particular the Convention on the
  Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) ratified by 189 countries,
  and the Voluntary Guidelines for the Responsible Governance of the Tenure of
  Land Fisheries and Forestry (VGGT) endorsed unanimously by Committee of Food
  Security (CFS) members in 2012.</p>

  <p>The six proxies through which indicator 5.a.2 is monitored are the
  following:</p>

  <p>Proxy A: Joint registration of land compulsory or encouraged through
  economic incentives</p>

  <p>Proxy B: Compulsory spousal consent for land transactions</p>

  <p>Proxy C: Women&#x2019;s and girls&#x2019; equal inheritance rights</p>

  <p>Proxy D: Allocation of financial resources to increase women&#x2019;s
  ownership and control over land</p>

  <p>Proxy E: In legal systems that recognise customary land tenure, existence
  of explicit protection of the land rights of women</p>

  <p>Proxy F: Mandatory quotas for women&#x2019;s participation in land
  management and administration institutions</p>

  <p>Concepts:</p>

  <p>The indicator tracks progress on legal reforms that guarantee
  women&#x2019;s land rights (including customary) in terms of ownership and/or
  control. </p>

  <p>The indicator refers to customary law. The inclusion of the customary
  dimension in the indicator is very important because in many contexts in which
  these systems prevail, women&#x2019;s land rights tend to be denied or
  insecure. However, the enormous diversity of customs and social norms that
  govern customary land among countries and their unwritten nature, create a
  significant challenge for assessing whether the proxies are present in these
  systems. To solve this issue, it is proposed that the customary dimension will
  be considered only when the formal legal framework recognizes customary land
  tenure. </p>

  <p>Finally, the indicator refers to ownership and/or control of land which are
  two critical but different dimensions regarding women&#x2019;s land rights.
  Land ownership refers to the legally recognised right to acquire, to use and
  to transfer landed property, while the control over land is associated with
  the ability to make decisions over land.</p>

  <p>Key definitions are the following:</p>

  <p>Land: Land is defined as all immovable property &#x2013; for instance the
  house, the land upon which a house is built and land which is used for other
  purposes, such as agricultural production. It also encompasses any other
  structures built on land to meet permanent purposes. Legal frameworks commonly
  use the terms &#x2018;immovable property&#x2019; or &#x2018;real
  property&#x2019; when referring to land.</p>

  <p>Land ownership: Land ownership is a legally recognised right to acquire, to
  use and to transfer land. In private property systems, this is a right akin to
  a freehold tenure. In systems where land is owned by the state, the term land
  ownership refers to possession of the rights most akin to ownership in a
  private property system &#x2013; for instance, long-term leases, occupancy,
  tenancy or use rights granted by the state that are transferrable and are
  granted to users for several decades (for instance 99 years).</p>

  <p>Control over land: Control over land is the ability to make decisions over
  land. It may include rights to make decisions about how the land should be
  used, including what crops should be planted, and to benefit financially from
  the sale of crops, including what crops should be planted, and to benefit
  financially from the sale of crops. </p>

  <p>Customary land tenure: Customary land tenure is defined as the bodies of
  rules and institutions governing the way land and natural resources are held,
  managed, used and transacted within customary legal systems.</p>

  <p>Customary legal systems: Customary legal systems are systems that exist at
  the local or community level, that have not been set up by the state, and that
  derive their legitimacy from the values and traditions of the indigenous or
  local group. Customary legal systems may or may not be recognized by national
  law. </p>

  <p>Legal and policy framework: The legal and policy framework encompasses the
  Constitution, policy, primary legislation and secondary legislation. The legal
  and policy framework includes customary legal systems where they have been
  recognised by statutory law.</p>

  <p>Personal laws: Personal law is defined as a set of codified rules and norms
  applying to a group of people sharing a common religious faith with regard to
  personal matters. These laws usually cover family relations, marriage, and
  inheritance. The term can be used interchangeably with &#x2018;religious
  laws&#x2019;.</p>

  <p>Primary legislation: Primary legislation refers to (i) acts or statutes
  that have been formally adopted at national level following the official
  parliamentary procedure for the passage of laws (in parliamentary systems);
  (ii) other acts at the national level with the force of law, such as
  decree-laws and legislative decrees and otherwise (in parliamentary systems);
  (iii) other legal instruments that have that have been formally endorsed by a
  law-making body, for instance presidential and royal orders or presidential
  and royal decrees (in non-parliamentary systems or systems where law-making
  power lies in an additional institution to the parliament). In all cases,
  primary legislation must have the force of law, be binding. For the purposes
  of this assessment primary legislation also includes the Constitution. </p>

  <p>Secondary legislation: Secondary legislation includes subsidiary, delegated
  or subordinate legal instruments that have the force of law, are binding and
  shall not be in contradiction with primary legislation. They are usually
  passed by the executive, such as national regulations, rules, by-laws,
  determinations, directions, circulars, orders, and implementing decrees.</p>

  <p>Joint registration: Joint registration is where the names of both spouses
  or both partners in an unmarried couple, are entered into the land registry as
  the owners or principal users of the land being registered. Joint registration
  signifies a form of shared tenure over the land &#x2013; usually either a
  joint tenancy/occupancy or a tenancy in common). In legal systems which
  include a framework for land titling, joint registration is commonly referred
  to as joint titling. </p>

  <p>Unmarried couples: Unmarried couples are defined as couples who live
  together (cohabit) in an intimate relationship, but who are not married in
  accordance with the marriage law of the country. Often this will refer to
  couples who were married under custom or religious laws, where such marriages
  are not recognised or do not comply with the requirements of the formal law.
  It may also refer to relationships that are recognised by the state but that
  are not considered a marriage &#x2013; for instance a civil partnership and a
  de facto relationship that is registered with the state. The term
  &#x2018;unmarried couples&#x2019; is often used interchangeably with
  &#x2018;de facto unions&#x2019;, &#x2018;consensual unions&#x2019; or
  &#x2018;irregular unions&#x2019;. The members of an unmarried couple are
  referred to as &#x2018;partners&#x2019;.</p>

  <p>Land transactions: Land transactions for the purpose of the methodology are
  major land transactions, specifically the sale and encumbrance (mortgage) of
  land. </p>

  <p>Inheritance: Inheritance is defined as property passing at the owner&apos;s
  death to the heir or those entitled to succeed.</p>

  <p>Deceased&#x2019;s estate: The deceased&#x2019;s estate encompasses the
  legal rights, interests and entitlements, to property of any kind (not only
  land) which the deceased spouse or partner enjoyed at the time of death, less
  any liabilities. Depending on the legal system, marital property may be
  excluded fully from the calculation of deceased&#x2019;s estate, or, the
  deceased&#x2019;s 50% share in the marital property will be included. </p>

  <p>Equal inheritance rights for sons and daughters: Equal inheritance rights
  for sons and daughters refer to the situation when the lines of succession in
  the legal and policy framework governing inheritance states equality of rank
  and shares between brothers and sisters or between daughters and sons, or are
  gender neutral.</p>
UNIT_MEASURE: <p>Articles present in primary and/or secondary legislation.</p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>The 6 proxies are drawn from international law and internationally accepted
  good practices, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of
  Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) ratified by 189 countries, and the
  Voluntary Guidelines for the Responsible Governance of the Tenure of Land
  Fisheries and Forestry (VGGT) endorsed unanimously by Committee of Food
  Security (CFS) members in 2012.</p>
SRC_TYPE_COLL_METHOD: ''
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Sources of data for measuring Indicator 5.a.2 are the official versions of
  national policies, primary law and secondary legislation which must be
  publicly available. More specifically, the relevant laws include the
  following: land, family, marriage, inheritance, land registration, gender
  equality laws, constitution, agrarian reform. Relevant policies include
  policies include policies on land, agriculture and gender.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>For the purpose of the official reporting at the global level, ONLY the
  proxies localized in the primary and/or secondary law will be reported because
  of their binding nature. The only exception to this rule is Proxy D where also
  national wide programs are considered for the purpose of the assessment.
  However, for the meaningfulness of the assessment, relevant policies are
  considered for the analysis because they represent the foundations of the law
  setting out the principles that indicate the direction towards which the
  country aims to move and very often suggest reforms that need to be adopted in
  the legal framework. In this sense, if the proxies are present in these types
  of instruments they constitute an important step towards a more gender
  sensitive legal framework.</p>

  <p>The data are extracted directly from the laws in force at the moment when
  the assessment is carried out. Data collection/provision entails the
  assessment of the relevant laws to determine if the six proxies are present or
  not in the legal framework. Data will be compiled in an electronic
  questionnaire organized as follows:</p>

  <p>Section 1: General Instructions </p>

  <p>&#x2022;. Respondant Information</p>

  <p>&#x2022; Instructions for filling the questionnaire</p>

  <p>Section 2: Legal Assessment</p>

  <p>&#x2022;. Checklist of policy and legal instruments relevant for the
  assessment in order to guide the expert in the identification of the proxies
  in the policy and legal framework of the country analysed.</p>

  <p>&#x2022;. Form 1 &#x201C;Policy and legal instruments, including provisions
  for Proxy (x)&#x201D;. This form composed of a set of questions to be answered
  (YES or No) to determine if the proxy is present. The details of the
  instruments containing the Proxy are to be provided in this form.</p>

  <p>&#x2022;. Form 2 &#x201C;results of Assessment &#x2013; Proxy (x)&#x201D;.
  This form summarizes the results of the assessment for each proxy.</p>

  <p>Section 3: Summary of the Assessment (Country Results)</p>

  <p>To complete the indicator 5.a.2 assessment, national legal experts must
  examine the national legal and policy framework and complete the electronic
  questionnaire following the methodological guidelines. This involves three
  steps that must be repeated for each proxy. </p>

  <p>1. Collect all the relevant policy and legal documents, using the checklist
  contained in the electronic questionnaire as a guide as to the instruments to
  check for the concerned proxy.</p>

  <p>2. Using the detailed methodological guidelines, determine whether the
  proxy exists in the legal and policy framework and in which instruments. </p>

  <p>3. Complete the questionnaire for each proxy, citing the instrument and the
  relevant provisions where the proxy was located as well as any further
  relevant information or exception. Include a hyperlink to the text of the
  legal and policy instrument. </p>

  <p>After these three steps have been undertaken for all six proxies the
  national responsible institution will identify the level of protection to
  women&#x2019;s land rights present in the legal framework according to the
  number of proxies located. </p>

  <p>The filled questionnaire will be communicated to FAO for the quality
  control and global reporting to the UN SDGs Secretariat. </p>
FREQ_COLL: <p>Countries are expected to report every two years.</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>All countries are in a position to start reporting on the first year as the
  source of data (the laws) are available in all of them and
  &#x201C;measuring&#x201D; the indicator is very straightforward. Moreover, the
  assessment can be conducted by one legal expert in a very short timeframe
  (about 15 days).</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>Governments should nominate a national entity responsible for the
  collection of data and monitoring for indicator 5.a.2. The concerned indicator
  has three important features that should guide Government&#x2019;s decision in
  the selection of the institution that will have the responsibility for the
  monitoring of tis indicator: the legal nature of the indicator, land tenure
  aspects and gender/women&#x2019;s rights. In view of this, the most adequate
  national institutions that could be designated for having this responsibility
  are land related institutions (i.e. Ministries of Land or the national
  institution governing land matters) or a national gender institution (i.e.
  Gender Equality Commissions, Women&#xB4;s Affairs or Gender Ministries).
  Alternatively, a national institution with responsibility for upholding the
  rule of law such as the Ministries of Justice or Human Rights Commissions
  would be also appropriate.</p>
COMPILING_ORG: >-
  <p>FAO is responsible for compilation and reporting on this indicator at the
  global level. After checking and validating the results, the national
  responsible entity submits the questionnaire to FAO. Upon receipt of the
  questionnaire, FAO will undertake a quality check, and revert to the national
  responsible institution in case clarifications or revisions are needed. FAO
  will then compute the indicator based on the information supplied by countries
  and communicate the results to the UN SDGs Secretariat.</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>Article I of the FAO constitution requires that the Organization collect,
  analyses, interpret and disseminate information relating to nutrition, food
  and agriculture. </p>

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Indicator 5.a.2 measures the extent to which countries&#x2019; legal
  framework (including customary law) guarantees women&#x2019;s equal rights to
  land ownership and/or control.</p>

  <p>The focus on land of Indicator 5.a.2 reflects the recognition that land is
  a key economic resource inextricably linked to access to, use of and control
  over other economic and productive resources. It is a key input for
  agricultural production; it can be used as collateral to access financial
  resources, extension services or to join producer organisations; and, it can
  generate income directly, if rented or sold. It also acknowledges that
  women&#x2019;s ownership of and/or control of land is critical for poverty
  reduction, food security, inclusiveness and overall sustainable development
  objectives. Finally, gender equality in land ownership and control is a human
  right. For example, Article 3 of the International Covenant on Civil and
  Political Rights (ICCPR) guarantees equality between women and men, and
  prohibits discrimination based on sex in Article 2. Article 26 of the treaty
  enshrines equality before the law, and can be applied to defend women&#x2019;s
  right to non-discrimination and equality, not only with respect to civil and
  political rights, but also with economic and social rights. Further, the
  Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW),
  emphasizes that discrimination against women &#x201C;violates the principles
  of equality of rights and respect for human dignity&quot;.</p>

  <p>The following paragraphs describe the scope and rationale of the proxies,
  as well as its specific content. </p>

  <p>For guidance on the meaning of the terms used in the proxies please refer
  to the terminology in section 2.a &#x201C;Definitions and concepts&#x201D; of
  this document. For detailed information on the conditions determining whether
  the proxy exists in the legal and policy framework please refer to the
  methodological guidelines &#x201C;Realizing women&#x2019;s rights to land in
  the law. A Guide for reporting on SDG Indicator 5.a.2&#x201D;.</p>

  <p>Proxy A: Is the joint registration of land compulsory or encouraged through
  economic incentives?</p>

  <p>Without the inclusion of their names on the land title, deed or
  certificate, women&#x2019;s property rights remain insecure, especially in the
  context of land registration programs and of property acquired by the spouses
  during the marriage. This is particularly the case for married women who
  separate, divorce, are abandoned or become widows.</p>

  <p>The proxy therefore assesses whether the legal and policy framework include
  provisions requiring joint registration of land or encouraging joint
  registration through economic incentives for both married and unmarried
  couples. For the proxy to be present it is sufficient that joint registration
  is provided at least for married couples.</p>

  <p>Proxy B: Does the legal and policy framework require spousal consent for
  land transactions?</p>

  <p>Whenever actions are taken unilaterally by a husband or male partner
  regarding land related transactions such sale, mortgage or lease, especially
  when they concern the family home or other critical assets, they can leave
  women and any children homeless and without means of subsistence. Therefore,
  spousal or partner consent requirements prior to any land transaction
  strengthen women&#x2019;s control rights over land whether they are married or
  within an unmarried couple. By supporting equality in the marriage and the
  joint administration of important property, such provisions directly
  contribute to the achievement of indicator 5.a.2, particularly with regard to
  gender equality in the control over land. </p>

  <p>The proxy examines whether countries incorporate into the legal and policy
  framework a spouse or partner consent for land transactions. As with proxy A,
  the assessment covers both married and unmarried couples. Yet, for proxy B to
  be present it is sufficient that spousal consent is provided at least for
  married couples.</p>

  <p>Proxy C: Does the legal and policy framework support women&#x2019;s and
  girls&#x2019; equal inheritance rights?</p>

  <p>Inheritance is one of the main channels through which women acquire
  property and secure independent land rights. However, the persistence of
  discriminatory cultural and legal norms often denies women&#x2019;s and
  girls&#x2019; equal inheritance rights and hinder women&#x2019;s opportunity
  to acquire property on an equal footing to men. Personal laws and customary
  laws in particular have often denied women&#x2019;s right to inherit or at
  least to inherit equal shares, and many post-colonial governments have
  incorporated these rules in the formal legal architecture. In some cases,
  daughters may only be entitled to inherit in the absence of a traceable male
  relative. </p>

  <p>Proxy C examines the extent to which states have incorporated into their
  legal and policy framework provisions that guarantee equal inheritance rights
  over land to surviving children and surviving spouses.</p>

  <p>This proxy aims to identify if the legal and policy framework of a country:
  </p>

  <p>1. Provide that sons and daughters have equal inheritance rights and equal
  shares; and</p>

  <p>2. Provide that male and female surviving spouse and/or partner are
  entitled to an equal right of the deceased spouse&#x2019;s estate and/or to a
  lifetime user right to the family home.</p>

  <p>Both equal inheritance rights for sons and daughters and surviving spouse
  and/or partner have to be ensured for Proxy to be present.</p>

  <p>Proxy D: Does the legal and policy framework provide for the allocation of
  financial resources to increase women&#x2019;s ownership and control over
  land?</p>

  <p>Legal reforms to support gender equality in land ownership and/or control
  and access to other productive resources have not always translated into
  practice. The poor implementation of land and agriculture related policies and
  laws geared towards enhancing gender equality, is partially due to the lack or
  insufficiency of financial resources. </p>

  <p>For this reason, this proxy identifies any legal provision that commits the
  government to allocate financial resources for the purpose of increasing
  women&#x2019;s ownership and control over land or access to productive
  resources, including land. Such provisions are widely regarded as innovative
  measures to support women&#x2019;s land rights, and have been consistently
  endorsed by the CEDAW Committee in its deliberations and comments on state
  parties&#x2019; reports under the treaty. The &#x201C;condition sine qua
  non&#x201D; for this proxy to be satisfied that the fund is anchored into the
  national law and explicitly mentions the purpose of improving women&#x2019;s
  land rights.</p>

  <p>Since Proxy D amounts to a &#x201C;special measure&#x201D;, as per Art. 4
  of CEDAW, countries that do not include this measure in their legal and policy
  framework, yet provide official national statistical data showing the
  achievement of at least 40 percent of women&#x2019;s ownership and/or control
  over land (e.g. data on SDG 5.a.1, or 1.4.2.), will equally satisfy the
  proxy.</p>

  <p>Proxy E: In legal systems that recognise customary land tenure, does the
  legal and policy framework explicitly protect the land rights of women?</p>

  <p>Many countries have incorporated customary land tenure rights into the
  formal legal system, in effect &#x2018;formalizing&#x2019; them. The legal
  recognition of customary land tenure however may reinforce discriminatory
  practices where there is no explicit protection for women&#x2019;s customary
  land rights. Further, the use of gender neutral provisions in the context of
  formalisation of customary land tenure has in practice been associated with a
  lack of protection of women&#x2019;s rights. To avoid such outcomes explicit
  provisions securing the protection of the land rights of women should
  accompany any legal provision recognizing customary land rights. </p>

  <p>Proxy E assesses whether the Constitution and/or any land related law that
  recognises customary land tenure provides explicit protections for
  women&#x2019;s land rights. </p>

  <p>It is important to note that for those countries where customary law has
  not been incorporated into the legal framework, Proxy E is not applicable and
  will not be assessed in the computation. As noted above, the only feasible way
  to take into account/to measure the customary dimension of this indicator is
  when it has been legally recognised, and therefore incorporated in the legal
  framework. </p>

  <p>Proxy F: Does the legal and policy framework mandate women&#x2019;s
  participation in land management and administration institutions?</p>

  <p>Land related institutions are responsible for governing the land tenure
  systems, and are in charge of land administration and management. Women are
  often excluded from participating in the day-to-day processes of land
  governance at all levels, and therefore have limited capacity to influence
  decision-making. A lack of women&#x2019;s representation in land governance
  tends to lead to biased outcomes in land recording and registration processes
  and the hindering of women&#x2019;s land claims, for instance by overlooking
  women&#x2019;s rights on common lands. </p>

  <p>Proxy F aims to identify provisions within the legal framework requiring
  mandatory participation of women (quotas) in land related management and
  administration institutions.</p>

  <p>Since Proxy F amounts to a &#x201C;special measure&#x201D;, as per Art. 4
  of CEDAW, countries that do not include this measure in their legal and policy
  framework, yet provide official national statistical data showing the
  achievement of at least 40 percent of women&#x2019;s ownership and/or control
  over land (e.g. data on SDG 5.a.1, or 1.4.2.), will equally satisfy the
  proxy.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Customary law. Indicator 5.a.2 entails an important challenge in terms of
  the assessment and computation of the results due to the reference to
  customary law in the title of the indicator. Customary law is not a homogenous
  system of law. Therefore, unless it is recognised by the general legal system,
  it will be extremely difficult to monitor whether or not customary law
  guarantees men and women equal rights to land ownership and(/or) control. In
  order to guarantee feasibility of the assessment, the choice of the
  methodology has been to monitor customary law to the extent that it has been
  recognised in the legal framework of a country. This however is a major
  limitation for the purposes of the SDGs of &#x201C;leaving no one
  behind&#x2019; as it excludes from the assessment many legal systems where
  customary practices which have not been endorsed in statutory law which are
  one of the major factors of discrimination against women. Further, given that
  customary law does not exist in all countries, it is not universally
  applicable and computation of the results represents a major challenge. The
  methodology has addressed this issue by creating a dual system of computation
  of the results which allows to assess separately those systems where customary
  law has been recognized, and those where no recognition of customary law is
  present. </p>

  <p>Geographical scope. The data collected for the SDG indicators is collected
  at the national level to ensure that it is representative of the country
  situation. This means that the 5.a.2 assessment to determine the existence of
  the proxies should focus on legal and policy instruments that have nationwide
  authority. In countries where law-making power for land or gender matters are
  not within the authority of the national government (or are shared between the
  national government and a sub-national government level), there may be a
  number of different state/provincial or county laws and policy that can be
  analysed. Further there may be inconsistencies between these different
  sub-national laws in terms of the presence of a proxy and the degree of its
  integration in the legal and policy framework. </p>

  <p>Where this is the case, the assessment should be conducted in as many
  states or counties needed to cover at least 50 percent of the total
  country&#x2019;s population. Therefore, the proxy should be located in all of
  the legal and policy frameworks relevant to these locations. If it is not the
  case, the proxy is not present.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The qualitative and legal nature of this indicator required the development
  of nuanced and articulated methodology that could be feasible, universally
  relevant and meaningful. </p>

  <p>The computation of results under Indicator 5.a.2 involves two steps: (1)
  classification of country according the number of proxies located <strong>in
  primary or primary and secondary legislation</strong> and (2) consolidation of
  all country results for global reporting.</p>

  <h2>Step 1: Classification categories of country </h2>

  <p>The country will be classified according to the total number of proxies
  found in <u>primary legislation</u> or <u>primary and secondary
  legislation</u>. Given that <strong>not in all countries</strong> customary
  land tenure rules exist or customary law is recognised (related to proxy E),
  for the purpose of computation a two-scale (or dual) approach has been
  developed: </p>

  <p>For countries where customary land tenure is <strong>NOT</strong>
  recognised in the legal framework (either via statute or the constitution),
  regardless of whether it exists <em>de facto </em>or not, Proxy E is marked
  <strong>non-applicable</strong> and the country will be assessed out of the
  five remaining proxies. </p>

  <p>For countries where customary land tenure is recognised in the legal
  framework, the country will be assessed against all six proxies,</p>

  <p>The table below describes the dual approach classification and the
  classification bands. As is shown below, in countries where customary law is
  applicable (Proxy E) the presence of five or six proxies are included in the
  same band (band 6 - very high levels of guarantees). This is due to the
  necessity of making universal the calculation of the component of customary
  law - a component of the indicator which in itself is not universal to all
  countries.</p>

DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>As with all the SDG targets and indicators, the monitoring and reporting
  process for target 5.a is global in scope and country-led. For this reason,
  FAO make substantial efforts for ensuring countries&#x2019; commitment and
  ownership for the reporting process.</p>

  <p>FAO provides support to the national legal expert and designated focal
  point(s) from the nominated responsible institution for SDG indicator 5.a.2 to
  carry out the assessment and fill the questionnaire closely following the
  methodological guidelines prepared by FAO. To facilitate the process FAO also
  shares with them relevant materials, including the methodological guidelines
  &#x201C;Realizing women&#x2019;s rights to land in the law&#x201D;, the
  questionnaire and the e-learning (<a
  href="https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=364">https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=364</a>).
  These materials currently exist in English, French and Spanish. When the
  assessment has been finalized the responsible institution submit the
  questionnaire to FAO for the quality control. FAO&#x2019; s focal point for
  the indicator and legal experts review the report against the criteria set in
  the methodology for each proxy. The reviewed questionnaire is then sent back
  to the the country for validation. There are as many iterations as needed
  until an agreement is reached so that the results are consistent with the
  methodology.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: <p>NA</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p>&#x2022; At country level</p>

  <p>Although data availability is ensured and all UN countries are expected to
  report, this might not be the case. Different countries may report at
  different times and a non-negligible share of countries may choose not to
  report on the indicator at all during the reporting period creating missing
  values.</p>

  <p>The missing values will be treated in the following way:</p>

  <p>a) For countries, which have reported in only 1 period, FAO does not have
  information on whether they are making progress on the indicator. However, FAO
  can take a few steps to alleviate the problem with missing values. First, FAO
  can assume that there was no progress on the indicator over the reporting
  periods. This can be easily determined by looking at the submitted
  questionnaire for identifying the date of adoption of the relevant instruments
  (laws). </p>

  <p>b) The only way to include countries that will never report is to cluster
  them in a category of missing information. This is because no assumption can
  be done regarding the status of each country&#x2019;s laws. However, it is
  important to keep track of the countries which do not report rather than limit
  the analysis to the reporting countries</p>

  <p>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</p>

  <p>The regional and global aggregates will be based solely on those countries
  for which data are available, but at no point countries with missing data will
  be treated as if they were the same as those for which data are available. The
  global or regional aggregates would be valid for the reporting countries but
  not necessarily for the region as whole or at the global level as a whole.
  Missing values for individual countries or areas cannot be imputed or
  estimated to derive regional or global aggregates of the indicator because no
  assumption can be done regarding the status of each country&#x2019;s laws</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>In each reporting period, the reporting countries are classified in 1 of 6
  bands depending on how many proxies are present in the primary or primary and
  secondary legislation as detailed in Table 1. The share of countries in each
  band is estimated in each year using the following formula: </p>

  <p>As there is currently no treatment of missing values at country level,
  regional and global aggregates will be based solely on those countries for
  which data are available. This may result in users interpreting these
  aggregates as pertaining to all countries in the region, which is the
  equivalent of treating countries with missing data as if they were the same as
  those for which data are available.</p>

  <p>In the first expected reporting period, which is 2020, we will only have
  one data point per country. In the first reporting period, we can only measure
  and report the shares of countries in each of the 6 bands as well as the share
  of countries which have not reported yet. This first reporting period will
  also serve as the baseline against which future progress will be measured.</p>

  <h2>Obtaining internationally comparable data for global monitoring:</h2>

  <p>As noted above delegated national institutions will be responsible for
  undertaking the legal assessment at the national level. It is recommended that
  the results of the final assessment are shared widely and validated by a
  cross-section of relevant institutions prior to final submission to FAO.</p>

  <p>Both the national legal expert(s) and institutions carrying out the
  assessment and the FAO Gender and Land Rights team will follow the detailed
  Guidelines in assessing whether the proxy is present or not present in the
  legal framework. The detailed Guidelines are a mechanism to ensure the
  robustness and comparability of the data collected at the national level, and
  to ensure that like situations are treated like. The initial legal research
  for developing the methodology and its piloting process in different
  regions/contexts were invaluable in delineating the threshold of each proxy
  and ensuring that countries are treated equitably under the methodology in
  terms of the different ways in which the proxies may appear in national
  legislation. A good example of this is proxy B, spousal consent for land
  transactions, under which the Guidelines provide outline which type of legal
  provisions meet the proxy threshold with specific reference to the three
  different marital regimes &#x2013; separate, partial community or community
  property. Similarly, the methodology provides clear guidance on how to treat
  legal regimes that do not provide for private ownership &#x2013; by providing
  examples of what type of &#x2018;ownership&#x2019; would equate the equivalent
  to a freehold estate under systems where all land is owned by the state. </p>

QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>This is a qualitative, legal indicator. Upon submission of the reporting
  questionnaire by the focal point in the responsible institution, the Land
  Rights team performs a quality assessment on the basis of the methodological
  guidelines. This ensures that the reporting is carried out consistently across
  all reporting countries. During this quality review, the FAO Land Rights team
  may provide methodological clarifications to ensure conformity with the
  methodological guidelines.</p>
