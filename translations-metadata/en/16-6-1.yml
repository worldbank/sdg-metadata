  <p>Primary government expenditures as a proportion of original approved
  budget</p>

  <p>This indicator measures the extent to which aggregate budget expenditure
  outturn reflects the amount originally approved, as defined in government
  budget documentation and fiscal reports. The coverage is budgetary central
  government (BCG) and the time period covered is the last three completed
  fiscal years.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>Aggregate expenditure includes actual expenditures incorporating those
  incurred as a result of unplanned or exceptional events&#x2014;for example,
  armed conflicts or natural disasters. Expenditures financed by windfall
  revenues, including privatization, should be included and noted in the
  supporting fiscal tables and narrative. Expenditures financed externally by
  loans or grants should be included, if covered by the budget, along with
  contingency vote(s) and interest on debt. Expenditure assigned to suspense
  accounts is not included in the aggregate. However, if amounts are held in
  suspense accounts at the end of any year that could affect the scores if
  included in the calculations, they can be included. In such cases the
  reason(s) for inclusion must be clearly stated.</p>

  <p>Actual expenditure outturns can deviate from the originally approved budget
  for reasons unrelated to the accuracy of forecasts&#x2014;for example, as a
  result of a major macroeconomic shock. The calibration of this indicator
  accommodates one unusual or &#x201C;outlier&#x201D; year and focuses on
  deviations from the forecast which occur in two of the three years covered by
  the assessment.</p>

  <p>Very detailed resources are available at:
  http://www.pefa.org/en/content/pefa-2016-framework. The document
  &#x201C;Framework for assessing public financial management&#x201D; is
  extremely useful
  (https://www.pefa.org/sites/pefa.org/files/attachments/PEFA%20Framework_English.pdf).
  There are seven Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
  Performance pillars containing a total of 31 indicators. The pillar containing
  this indicator is part of Pillar I which measures Budget reliability.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The Budget Laws of countries is the usual source of the approved budget of
  countries. The end-of-year fiscal reports (/budget execution reports) are the
  sources of the actual spending. This data is typically obtained from websites
  of the Ministry of Finance (MoF) or the national Parliament, or data are
  collected through communication with the MoF.</p>

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The indicator attempts to capture the reliability of government budgets: do
  governments spend what they intend to and do they collect what they set out to
  collect. It is a simple and intuitive indicator that is easily understood and
  the methodology is transparent and every rating easily verifiable.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Although not all countries have used the methodology on an annual basis for
  this indicator, the methodology relies on standard data sets for approved and
  final budget outturns which are commonly produced at least annually in every
  country. The countries that have not used the methodology to date are
  primarily highly developed countries which would have less difficulty in
  providing the necessary data than those in the lower and middle income
  categories that have been primary users of Public Expenditure and Financial
  Accountability (PEFA) to date.</p>

  <p>One limitation of the indicator is that it is an aggregate indicator of
  budget reliability. While it can be disaggregated across regions, it is not
  disaggregated across various budget subcomponents. Different indicators are
  used for assessing changes in expenditure composition in the PEFA framework.
  Also, while this indicator is intended to measure budget reliability it should
  be understood that actual expenditure outturns can deviate from the originally
  approved budget for reasons unrelated to the accuracy of forecasts&#x2014;for
  example, as a result of a major macroeconomic shock. However, the calibration
  of this indicator accommodates one unusual or &#x201C;outlier&#x201D; year and
  focuses on deviations from the forecast which occur in two of the three years
  covered by the assessment. Therefore, single year shocks are discounted
  allowing a more balanced assessment.</p>

  <p>The broader context in which the indicator was developed is as follows.
  PEFA is a tool for assessing the status of public financial management and
  reporting on the strengths and weaknesses of Public Financial Management
  (PFM). A PEFA assessment provides a thorough, consistent and evidence-based
  analysis of PFM performance at a specific point in time and can be reapplied
  in successive assessments to track changes over time. The PEFA framework
  provides the foundation for evidence-based measurement of countries&#x2019;
  PFM systems using 31 performance indicators that are further disaggregated
  into 94 dimensions. A PEFA assessment measures the extent to which PFM
  systems, processes and institutions contribute to the achievement of desirable
  budget outcomes: aggregate fiscal discipline, strategic allocation of
  resources, and efficient service delivery.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The methodology for calculating this indicator is provided in a spreadsheet
  (titled &#x201C;En PI-1 and PI-2 Exp Calculation-Feb 1 2016 (xls)&#x201D;) on
  the PEFA website (http://www.pefa.org/en/content/pefa-2016-framework). It is
  also detailed in part 2 of the document &#x201C;Framework for assessing public
  financial management&#x201D;
  (https://www.pefa.org/sites/pefa.org/files/attachments/PEFA%20Framework_English.pdf).</p>

  <p>Scoring is at the heart of the indicator. A country is scored separately on
  a four-point ordinal scale: A, B, C, or D, according to precise criteria: </p>

  <p>(A) Aggregate expenditure outturn was between 95% and 105% of the approved
  aggregate budgeted expenditure in at least two of the last three years.</p>

  <p>(B) Aggregate expenditure outturn was between 90% and 110% of the approved
  aggregate budgeted expenditure in at least two of the last three years.</p>

  <p>(C Aggregate expenditure outturn was between 85% and 115% of the approved
  aggregate budgeted expenditure in at least two of the last three years.</p>

  <p>(D) Performance is less than required for a C score.</p>

  <p>In order to justify a particular score, every aspect specified in the
  scoring requirements must be fulfilled. If the requirements are only partly
  met, the criteria are not satisfied and a lower score should be given that
  coincides with achievement of all requirements for the lower performance
  rating. A score of C reflects the basic level of performance for each
  indicator and dimension, consistent with good international practices. A score
  of D means that the feature being measured is present at less than the basic
  level of performance or is absent altogether, or that there is insufficient
  information to score the dimension.</p>

  <p>The D score indicates performance that falls below the basic level.
  &#x2018;D&#x2019; is applied if the performance observed is less than required
  for any higher score. For this reason, a D score is warranted when sufficient
  information is not available to establish the actual level of performance. A
  score of D due to insufficient information is distinguished from D scores for
  low-level performance by the use of an asterisk&#x2014;that is, D* at the
  dimension level. The asterisk is not included at the indicator level.</p>

  <p>The coverage is budgetary central government (BCG) and requires data for
  three consecutive years as a basis for assessment. The data would cover the
  most recent completed fiscal year for which data is available and the two
  immediately preceding years.</p>
