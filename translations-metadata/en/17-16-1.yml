  <p>Definition:</p>

  <p>The indicator tracks the number of countries reporting progress in multi
  stakeholder monitoring frameworks that track the implementation of development
  effectiveness commitments supporting the achievement of sustainable
  development goals (SDGs). </p>

  <p>Concepts:</p>

  <p>&#x201C;Multi-stakeholder development effectiveness monitoring
  frameworks&#x201D; that track effective development cooperation are monitoring
  frameworks: </p>

  <p>&#x2022; whose indicators have been agreed on a voluntary basis; whose
  indicators measure the strength of the relationship between development
  actors; </p>

  <p>&#x2022; where data collection and review is led by the countries
  themselves; and where participation in data collection and review involves
  relevant stakeholders representing, at minimum, the public sector, the private
  sector and civil society organizations.</p>

  <p>The indicator takes into account the need to capture the respective roles
  and responsibilities of all parties involved in multi-stakeholder partnerships
  for development. It does so by looking at development effectiveness frameworks
  that are led by countries but include the participation of all relevant
  development partners. </p>

  <p>The Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (Global
  Partnership) monitoring framework is an example of existing development
  effectiveness monitoring frameworks. There are other complementary efforts,
  such as the ECOSOC Development Cooperation Forum (DCF) mutual accountability
  survey. Emerging and future monitoring frameworks that fit the above
  definition, such as recent efforts to track South-South Cooperation by SEGIB,
  could also be considered.</p>
UNIT_MEASURE: <p>Number of countries</p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>For developing countries, classification is based on SDG grouping provided
  by the UN Statistical Office (regional classification, LDCs, LLDCs, SIDS).
  Income classification follows the World Bank grouping (low, lower-middle,
  upper-middle, and high income. </p>

  <p>For development partners, classification is based on SDG grouping
  (regional). In addition, bilateral partners can be distinguished between
  members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and non-members. </p>
SRC_TYPE_COLL_METHOD: ''
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The monitoring is a voluntary and country led process. Country governments
  lead and coordinate data collection and validation. At country level, data are
  reported by relevant government entities (e.g. the Ministry of finance/budget
  department for national budget information) and by development partners and
  stakeholders. OECD and UNDP are supporting developing countries in collecting
  relevant data through the Global Partnership monitoring exercise, and these
  organisations lead data aggregation and quality assurance at the global level.
  </p>

  <p>Complementarily, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social
  Affairs has been conducting a regular survey for the Development Cooperation
  Forum, in cooperation with UNDP, to identify national progress in mutual
  accountability and transparency. Survey results are assessed in comprehensive
  studies, informing global monitoring and providing practical suggestions for
  improving development results. Synergies with the measurement of indicator 7
  of the Global Partnership monitoring framework are being used. Other
  complementary sources of data (i.e. additional multi- stakeholder frameworks)
  may be incorporated in the future to provide a broader picture of progress
  made by countries towards development effectiveness in support of SDG
  implementation. </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>(i) For the data collection process of the Global Partnership&apos;s
  monitoring exercise, a national coordinator is assigned from the country
  government. S/he typically comes from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of
  Planning, or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. </p>

  <p>(ii) The national coordinator in turn consults with other stakeholders
  (including country offices of providers of development co-operation, Civil
  Society Organisations, the private sector, and trade unions) to gather and
  validate data.</p>

  <p>The data is then reviewed by headquarters offices of providers of
  development co-operation.</p>

  <p>(iii) No adjustments are made to submitted data, given that the validation
  process needs to stay at country level. However, inconsistencies or possible
  problematic values are highlighted and sent back to national coordinators for
  revision.</p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>The data collection calendar for global data aggregation was on a biennial
  cycle. Data has been collected in 2016 and 2018. The next monitoring round
  will take place starting from 2023. </p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>Data release is scheduled for the first quarter in the year that
  immediately follows the national data gathering processes.</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>Leading central ministry from reporting countries. Typically the Ministry
  of Finance, the Ministry of Planning, or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
  depending on the division of labour within each government.</p>

  <p>Description:</p>

  <p>Representatives from the leading ministry in country governments &#x2013;-
  are responsible for leading the national data gathering process and
  country-level validation. These representatives coordinate the data collection
  process at the national level by consolidating data and inputs from providers
  of development co-operation, Civil Society Organisations, the private sector,
  and trade unions. For calculation of indicator 17.16.1, country governments
  submit the data to the OECD/UNDP Joint Support Team of the Global
  Partnership.</p>
COMPILING_ORG: <p>OECD and UNDP jointly compile and report the data at the global level.</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>As custodians of this SDG indicator, OECD and UNDP are responsible for
  providing technical guidance and supporting countries to collect data,
  compiling and verifying country data, and for submitting the country data and
  aggregate data for this indicator. Drawing on their institutional support
  provided to the Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation,
  OECD and UNDP leverage country participation in the Global Partnership
  monitoring exercise, which since 2013 has tracked progress towards the
  effectiveness principles and is the recognised source of data and evidence on
  upholding effectiveness commitments, to aggregate global data for this
  indicator. Countries not participating in the Global Partnership monitoring
  exercise are able to submit their country data directly to OECD and UNDP. </p>
OTHER_METHOD: ''
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals requires mobilizing and
  strengthening multi stakeholder partnerships that can bring and effectively
  use all the available knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources
  for sustainable development. The quality of the relationship between all the
  relevant partners defines the strength of the global partnership for
  sustainable development.</p>

  <p>The indicator provides a measure of countries&#x2019; efforts to enhance
  these multi stakeholder partnerships, and by extension the Global Partnership
  for Sustainable Development, by looking at progress made on a set of
  indicators that track how well country governments and development partners
  are working together towards sustainable development. </p>

  <p>Reflecting the spirit of the global partnership for sustainable
  development, and the universal nature of the SDGs, the indicator monitors the
  contribution and behaviour of both provider and recipient countries in
  establishing more effective, inclusive multi-stakeholder partnerships to
  support and sustain the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. It does so by
  measuring their respective but differentiated commitments to strengthen the
  quality of their development partnerships.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The design of the indicator has practical benefits: </p>

  <p>&#x2022; the indicator allows for relevant monitoring frameworks to be
  updated in line with evolving commitments and country specific context without
  affecting the spirit of the indicator;</p>

  <p>&#x2022; the indicator does not presume a globally-set multi-stakeholder
  framework, acknowledging the diversity of complementary efforts supporting
  effective development cooperation;</p>

  <p>&#x2022; the indicator allows participating countries to choose whether
  they would like to report as a provider of development co-operation, as a
  recipient, or both. </p>

  <p>Data collection for the Global Partnership monitoring framework is led by
  countries receiving development co-operation. Progress of countries providing
  development co-operation in implementing development effectiveness commitments
  is captured through their partnership behaviour in those countries. Depending
  on each case, countries that currently are both recipient and providers of
  development cooperation opt to report in their role as recipient and/or
  provider of development cooperation.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>To reflect the universal nature of target 17.16 this indicator is presented
  as the global aggregate number of countries reporting progress. For any
  country reporting towards one (or more) multi-stakeholder development
  effectiveness framework(s), the country is considered to be reporting progress
  when, for the year of reference, the number of indicators within the
  framework(s) that show a positive trend is greater than the number of
  indicators that show a negative trend.</p>

  <p><u>Countries providing development co-operation funding</u> and reporting
  in multi-stakeholder development effectiveness monitoring frameworks are
  assessed against the following elements: </p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Aligning to country-defined development objectives: </em>Percentage of new development interventions whose objectives are drawn from country-led results frameworks.</li>
    <li><em>Using country-led results frameworks: </em>Percentage of results indicators contained in new development interventions which are drawn from country-owned results frameworks.</li>
    <li><em>Using national monitoring and statistical systems: </em>Percentage of results indicators in new development interventions which will be monitored using government sources and monitoring systems.</li>
    <li><em>Using national evaluation systems: </em>Percentage of new interventions that plan a final evaluation with country government involvement.</li>
    <li><em>Transparency of development cooperation</em>: Public availability of information on development cooperation according to international reporting standards. </li>
    <li><em>Annual predictability of development cooperation</em>: Proportion of development cooperation disbursed as development partners had scheduled at the beginning of the year. </li>
    <li><em>Medium-term predictability of development cooperation: </em>forward-looking spending plans made available to the partner government (indicative annual amounts of development cooperation support to be provided over the one-to-three years). </li>
    <li><em>Development cooperation on budgets subject to parliamentary oversight: </em>share<em> </em>of development cooperation funds planned to/for the country&#x2019;s public sector that are recorded in the annual budget submitted for legislative approval.</li>
    <li><em>Development cooperation delivered through country systems: </em>Proportion of development cooperation disbursed to a given country according to national regulations and systems for public financial management (i.e. budgeting, financial reporting, auditing) and procurement.</li>
    <li><em>Untied aid: </em>Proportion of development cooperation that is untied.<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[1]</a></sup></li>
  </ul>

  <p><u>Countries receiving development cooperation funding</u> and reporting in
  multi-stakeholder development effectiveness monitoring frameworks are assessed
  against the following elements:<u> </u></p>

  <ol>
    <li><em>Leading in setting up national priorities: </em>Countries strengthen their<em> </em>national results frameworks.</li>
    <li><em>Creating an enabling environment for civil society organisations: </em>Civil society organizations operate within an environment that maximises their engagement in and contribution to development.</li>
    <li><em>Promoting private sector engagement and contribution to development: </em>Quality of public-private dialogue </li>
    <li><em>Recording development cooperation on budgets subject to parliamentary oversight</em>: Share of development cooperation funds planned to/for the country&#x2019;s public sector that are recorded in the annual budget submitted for legislative approval.</li>
    <li><em>Strengthening mutual accountability: </em>Mutual accountability among development actors is strengthened through inclusive reviews.</li>
    <li><em>Strengthening gender equality and women&#x2019;s empowerment: </em>Existence of transparent government systems to track public allocations for gender equality and women&#x2019;s empowerment. </li>
    <li><em>Strengthening domestic institutions: </em>Quality of the country&#x2019;s budgetary and public financial management.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Countries providing and receiving development cooperation funding are
  invited to select whether they would like to report against provider-specific
  commitments, against recipient-specific commitments, or against both sets of
  commitments.</p>

  <p>For countries reporting both as providers and recipients of development
  cooperation, progress is calculated separately based on the respective set of
  indicators described above. Disaggregated results will show the detailed
  performance in each category. For the ultimate count of the number of
  countries making progress, dual countries are accounted as making progress if
  progress is made as recipient <strong>or</strong> as provider of development
  cooperation. </p>

  <p>The baseline for assessing progress is the latest measurement available for
  each specific country. When no baseline exists for a country, the first
  measurement available for an indicator constitutes the baseline for future
  measurements of progress.</p>

  <p>When a country meets and sustains all targets for the indicators it reports
  on (i.e. it is logically impossible to make further progress) it is considered
  as &#x201C;making progress&#x201D;. </p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup

  and comprehensiveness of data for this indicator. OECD and UNDP provide
  helpdesk and guidance materials to support the national coordinator managing
  the quality of data. </p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>The national coordinator has the main responsibility to ensure the quality
  and comprehensiveness of data for this indicator. OECD and UNDP support the
  quality assurance of data through joint review of data with the national
  coordinator and by engaging development partners at HQ level, UN development
  system and UNDP country offices as needed, and cross checking with data set
  submitted for previous monitoring rounds.</p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>OECD and UNDP support the quality assessment through joint review of data
  with the national coordinator and by engaging development partners at HQ
  level, UN development system and UNDP country offices as needed, and cross
  checking with data set submitted for previous monitoring rounds.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p>Data availability:</p>

  <p>Global aggregates are available for the 2016 and 2018 Global Partnership
  monitoring rounds. New data will be available after 2023. </p>

  <p>Time series:</p>

  <p>Disaggregation:</p>

  <p>The indicator presented as a global aggregate is generated through a
  bottom-up approach whereby data is collected at the country level and can
  therefore be disaggregated back at the level of countries (for both
  development cooperation providers and recipients) for national analysis and
  mutual dialogue. The data can also be further disaggregated according to
  individual indicators (i.e. specific dimensions of effective development
  cooperation) that are included within the multi-stakeholder frameworks.</p>

  <p>To foster regional policy dialogue, disaggregation at the regional level is
  possible and encouraged. Some existing platforms are already using the
  evidence for regional monitoring, learning and policy discussions (e.g. NEPAD
  in Africa, the Asia-Pacific Development Effectiveness Facility in
  Asia-Pacific, the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, the UN Regional Economic
  Commissions). </p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>Sources of discrepancies:</p>

  <p>The national figures are directly aggregated to come up with global
  estimates. </p>
