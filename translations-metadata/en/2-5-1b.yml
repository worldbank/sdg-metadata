  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The conservation of plant and animal genetic resources for food and
  agriculture (GRFA) in medium or long term conservation facilities (<em>ex
  situ</em>, in genebanks) represents the most trusted means of conserving
  genetic resources worldwide. Plant and animal GRFA conserved in these
  facilities can be easily used in breeding programmes as well, even directly
  on-farm.</p>

  <p>The measure of trends in <em>ex situ</em> conserved materials provides an
  overall assessment of the extent to which we are managing to maintain and/or
  increase the total genetic diversity available for future use and thus
  protected from any permanent loss of genetic diversity which may occur in the
  natural habitat, i.e. <em>in situ</em>, or on-farm.</p>

  <p>The two components of the indicator 2.5.1, plant (a) and animal (b) GRFA,
  are separately counted.</p>

  <p><em>Animal genetic resources</em> </p>

  <p>The animal component is calculated as the number of local breeds (i.e.
  being reported to exist only in one country) stored within a genebank
  collection with an amount of genetic material stored which is required to
  reconstitute the breed in case of extinction (further information on
  &#x201C;sufficient material stored to reconstitute a breed&#x201D; can be
  found in the Guidelines on Cryconservation of Animal Genetic Resources, FAO,
  2012, accessible at http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm). The
  guidelines have been endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for
  Food and Agriculture at its Thirteenth Regular Session
  (http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/024/mc192e.pdf).</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p><em>Animal genetic resources</em></p>

  <p>Breed: A breed is either a sub-specific group of domestic livestock with
  definable and identifiable external characteristics that enable it to be
  separated by visual appraisal from other similarly defined groups within the
  same species, or a group for which geographical and/or cultural separation
  from phenotypically similar groups has led to acceptance of its separate
  identity. </p>

  <p>Medium or long term conservation facilities: Biological diversity is often
  conserved <em>ex situ</em>, outside its natural habitat, in facilities called
  genebanks. In the case of domestic animal diversity, <em>ex situ</em>
  conservation includes both the maintenance of live animals (<em>in vivo</em>)
  and cryoconservation. </p>

  <p>Cryoconservation is the collection and deep-freezing of semen, ova, embryos
  or tissues for potential future use in breeding or regenerating animals.</p>

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Genetic resources for food and agriculture provide the building blocks of
  food security and, directly or indirectly, support the livelihoods of every
  person on earth. As the conservation and accessibility to these resources are
  of vital importance, medium- or long- term conservation facilities (genebanks)
  to preserve and make these resources and their associated information
  accessible for breeding and research have been established at country,
  regional and global levels. Inventories of genebank holdings provide a dynamic
  measure of the existing plant and animal diversity and its level of
  preservation. Data relevant to this indicator facilitate the monitoring of
  diversity secured and accessible through genebanks and support the development
  and updating of strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of genetic
  resources.</p>

  <p>The indicator is related to a monitoring framework endorsed by the FAO
  Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture in which the status
  and trends of plant and animal genetic resources are described through
  globally agreed indicators and regular country-driven assessments. </p>

  <p>The number of materials conserved under medium- or long-term storage
  conditions provides an indirect measurement of the total genetic diversity,
  which are managed to secure for future use. Overall, positive variations are
  therefore approximated to an increase in the agro-biodiversity secured, while
  negative variations to a loss of it. </p>

  <p>The analysis of country reports to FAO provided by 128 countries in 2014
  for the preparation of &#x2018;The Second Report on the State of the
  World&#x2019;s Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture&#x2019;
  provided a first baseline with regard to the number of national breed
  populations where sufficient material is stored. As of February 2021,
  according to DAD-IS, genetic material is cryoconserved for only a very low
  proportion (9 percent) of local breeds and for only around 2.6 percent of
  breeds is the quantity of stored material estimated to be sufficient for
  population reconstitution..</p>
