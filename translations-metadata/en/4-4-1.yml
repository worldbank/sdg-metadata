  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The proportion of youth and adults with Information and Communications
  Technology (ICT) skills, by type of skill defined as the percentage of
  individuals that have undertaken certain ICT-related activities in the last 3
  months. The indicator is expressed as a percentage.<br></p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator on the proportion of individuals with ICT skills, by type of
  skills refers to individuals that have undertaken certain activities in the
  last three months. (Please note however, that until 2019 this data refer to
  computer-related activities and response categories, as explained below.)</p>

  <p>Computer-related activities to measure ICT skills are as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Copying or moving a file or folder</li>
    <li>Using copy and paste tools to duplicate or move information within a document</li>
    <li>Sending e-mails with attached files (e.g. document, picture, video)</li>
    <li>Using basic arithmetic formulas in a spreadsheet</li>
    <li>Connecting and installing new devices (e.g. a modem, camera, printer)</li>
    <li>Finding, downloading, installing and configuring software</li>
    <li>Creating electronic presentations with presentation software (including images, sound, video or charts)</li>
    <li>Transferring files between a computer and other devices</li>
    <li>Writing a computer program using a specialized programming language</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A computer refers to a desktop computer, a laptop (portable) computer or a
  tablet (or similar handheld computer). It does not include equipment with some
  embedded computing abilities, such as smart TV sets, and devices with
  telephony as their primary function, such as smartphones.</p>

  <p>Most individuals will have carried out more than one activity and therefore
  multiple responses are expected. The tasks are broadly ordered from less
  complex to more complex, although there is no requirement for a respondent to
  select simpler tasks before selecting a more complex task. </p>

  <p>From 2020, the data refer to skills irrespective of the device used. The
  new skills categories are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Using copy and paste tools to duplicate or move data, information and content in digital environments (e.g. within a document, between devices, on the cloud)</li>
    <li>Sending messages (e.g. e-mail, messaging service, SMS) with attached files (e.g. document, picture, video)</li>
    <li>Using basic arithmetic formulae in a spreadsheet</li>
    <li>Connecting and installing new devices (e.g. a modem, camera, printer) through wired or wireless technologies</li>
    <li>Finding, downloading, installing and configuring software and apps</li>
    <li>Creating electronic presentations with presentation software (including text, images, sound, video or charts)</li>
    <li>Transferring files or applications between devices (including via cloud-storage)</li>
    <li>Setting up effective security measures (e.g. strong passwords, log-in attempt notification) to protect devices and online accounts </li>
    <li>Changing privacy settings on your device, account or app to limit the sharing of personal data and information (e.g. name, contact information, photos)</li>
    <li>Verifying the reliability of information found online</li>
    <li>Programming or coding in digital environments (e.g. computer software, app development)</li>
  </ul>
UNIT_MEASURE: <p>Percent (%)</p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>Activities are classified according to agreement at the Expert Group
  meeting on information and communications technology (ICT) Household
  Indicators (EGH).</p>

  <p>Furthermore, for countries that collect this data through an official
  survey, and if data allow breakdown and disaggregation, the indicator can be
  broken down by region (urban/rural), by sex, by age group, by educational
  level (ISCED), by labour force status (ILO), and by occupation (ISCO).
  International Telecommunication Union (ITU) collects data for all of these
  breakdowns from countries.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Countries can collect data on this indicator through national household
  surveys. Data for different countries are compiled by the International
  Telecommunication Union (ITU).</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>Data for different countries are compiled and provided by the International
  Telecommunication Union (ITU).</p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>Various. Each survey has its own data collection cycle. The International
  Telecommunication Union (ITU) collects data twice a year from Member States,
  in Q1 and in Q3.</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) releases data twice per
  year on ICT skills.</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>Bodies responsible for conducting household surveys (including National
  Statistical Offices and Government Ministries) in which information on the use
  of ICT skills is collected. Data is compiled by the International
  Telecommunication Union (ITU).</p>
COMPILING_ORG: <p>International Telecommunication Union (ITU)</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>As the United Nations (UN) specialized agency for ICTs, the International
  Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the official source for global ICT
  statistics, collecting ICT data from its Member States. </p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>ICT skills determine the effective use of information and communication
  technology, so this indicator may therefore assist in making the link between
  ICT usage and impact. The lack of such skills continues to be one of the key
  barriers keeping people from fully benefitting from the potential of
  information and communication technologies. These data may be used to inform
  targeted policies to improve ICT skills, and thus contribute to an inclusive
  information society.</p>

  <p>This is also a core indicator of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for
  Development&apos;s Core List of Indicators, which has been endorsed by the UN
  Statistical Commission (in 2020).</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>This indicator is relatively new but based on an internationally-agreed
  definition and methodology, which have been developed under the coordination
  of International Telecommunications Union (ITU), through its Expert Groups and
  following an extensive consultation process with countries. It was also
  endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission in 2014<sup><a href="#footnote-2"
  id="footnote-ref-2">[1]</a></sup>, and again in 2020.</p>

  <p>The indicator is based on the responses provided by interviewees regarding
  certain activities that they have carried out in a reference period of time.
  However, it is not a direct assessment of skills nor do we know if those
  activities were undertaken effectively. </p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup

  Indicators of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development. <a
  href="#footnote-ref-2">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>This indicator is calculated as the proportion of in-scope who have carried
  out each activity in the past 3 months, regardless of where that activity took
  place. The indicator is expressed as a percentage.</p>

  <p>2005 onwards</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>Since data for the indicator on the proportion of individuals with ICT
  skills, by type of skills are collected through a survey, classificatory
  variables for individuals can provide further information on the differences
  in ICT skills among men/women, children/adults (age groups),
  employed/unemployed, etc., according to national requirements These data may
  be used to inform targeted policies to improve ICT skills, and thus contribute
  to the development of an inclusive information society.</p>
