  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> </p>

  <p>The annual growth rate of real GDP per employed person conveys the annual
  percentage change in real Gross Domestic Product per employed person. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong> </p>

  <p>Gross Domestic Product (GDP): It is the main measure of national output,
  representing the total value of all final goods and services within the System
  of National Accounts (SNA) production boundary produced in a particular
  economy (that is, the dollar value of all goods and services within the SNA
  production boundary produced within a country&#x2019;s borders in a given
  year). According to the SNA, &#x201C;GDP is the sum of gross value added of
  all resident producer units plus that part (possibly the total) of taxes on
  products, less subsidies on products, that is not included in the valuation of
  output &#x2026; GDP is also equal to the sum of the final uses of goods and
  services (all uses except intermediate consumption) measured at
  purchasers&#x2019; prices, less the value of imports of goods and services GDP
  is also equal to the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer
  units.&#x201D; </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP): Real GDP refers to GDP calculated at
  constant prices, that is, the volume level of GDP, excluding the effect of
  inflation and favouring comparisons of quantities beyond price changes.
  Constant price estimates of GDP are calculated by expressing values in terms
  of a base period. In theory, the price and quantity components of a value are
  identified and the price in the base period is substituted for that in the
  current period. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Employment: All persons of working age who, during a short reference period
  (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services
  for pay or profit. </p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong> </p>

  <p>Output measures used in the numerator of this indicator (Gross Domestic
  Product) are best obtained from the production side of national accounts and
  represent, as much as possible, GDP at market prices for the aggregate economy
  (adjusted for inflation, in constant prices). </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Employment data used in the denominator are preferably derived from labour
  force or other household surveys with an employment module. In the absence of
  a household survey, establishment surveys, administrative records or official
  estimates based on reliable sources can be used as well as population
  censuses. It is however important to note that employment data from
  establishment surveys will capture the number of jobs and not the number of
  persons employed as preferred for the denominator. Also, establishment surveys
  cover, in many cases, the formal sector and employers and employees only, not
  accounting for the whole economy. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>When calculating this indicator, it is important to ensure that the
  coverage of the employment data is consistent with that of the national
  accounts. </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>For the purposes of international reporting on the SDG indicators, the ILO
  uses country-level estimates of GDP in constant 2010 US$ from the World
  Bank&#x2019;s World Development Indicators database and country-level
  estimates on employment from household surveys or derived from the ILO
  modelled estimates to calculate levels and growth rates of labour productivity
  at the country, regional and global levels. </p>
FREQ_COLL: <p>Continuous</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>ILO estimates of labour productivity are part of the ILO modelled estimates
  series, analysed in the ILO&apos;s World Employment and Social Outlook
  reports. The ILO estimates are released once per year (in November or
  December). </p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>Input GDP and employment data are provided by national statistical offices,
  and in some cases labour ministries or other related agencies. </p>
COMPILING_ORG: <p>ILO </p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p> The ILO is the UN focal point for labour statistics. It sets international
  standards for labour statistics through the International Conference of Labour
  Statisticians. It also compiles and produces labour statistics with the goal
  of disseminating internationally-comparable datasets, and provides technical
  assistance and training to ILO member States to support their efforts to
  produce high quality labour market data.</p>
OTHER_METHOD: ''
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Real GDP per employed person being a measure of labour productivity, this
  indicator represents a measure of labour productivity growth, thus providing
  information on the evolution, efficiency and quality of human capital in the
  production process. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Economic growth in a country can be ascribed to many factors, including
  increased employment and more effective work by those who are employed. This
  indicator casts light on the latter effect, therefore being a key measure of
  economic performance. Labour productivity (and growth) estimates can support
  the formulation of labour market policies and monitor their effects. They can
  also contribute to the understanding of how labour market performance affects
  living standards. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Output measures are obtained from national accounts and represent, as much
  as possible, GDP at market prices for the aggregate economy. However, despite
  common principles that are mostly based on the United Nations System of
  National Accounts, there are still significant problems in international
  consistency of national accounts estimates, based on factors such as
  differences in the treatment of output in services sectors, differences in
  methods used to correct output measures for price changes (in particular, the
  use of different weighting systems to obtain deflators) and differences in the
  degree of coverage of informal economic activities. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Data on employment used in the denominator of this indicator refer, as much
  as possible, to the average number of persons with one or more paid jobs
  during the year. That is, the reliability of the employment data is also
  dependent on the degree of coverage of informal activities by the statistical
  source used. </p>

REG_AGG: >-
  <p>To address the problem of missing data, the ILO designed several
  econometric models which are used to produce estimates of labour market
  indicators in the countries and years for which real data are not available.
  The employment data derived from the ILO modelled estimates are used to
  produce estimates on labour productivity. These models use multivariate
  regression techniques to impute missing values at the country level, which are
  then aggregated to produce regional and global estimates. For further
  information on the estimates, please refer to the the ILO modelled estimates
  methodological overview, available at <a

  <p>Data Availability: Data for this indicator is available for 188 countries

  <p>Disaggregation:</p>

  <p>No disaggregation required for this indicator. </p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>Sources of discrepancies:</p>

  <p>The main limitations of the use of labour productivity as a global
  indicator arise from problems in the international comparability of data, more
  specifically from methodological differences across countries. Even though
  national output measures, in particular GDP estimates, are derived mainly from
  national accounts which should be based on internationally-agreed principles
  consolidated in the United Nations SNA, there are still significant obstacles
  to the international consistency of national accounts estimates. These range
  from differences in the treatment of the output of service sectors to
  adjustments for price changes and variations in the coverage of informal
  activities and the underground economy. </p>

  <p>Employment or labour input figures also suffer from comparability issues,
  especially in terms of differences in age coverage, the definition of
  employment, geographical and institutional coverage, the treatment of special
  groups and the coverage of informal employment. </p>

  <p>In cases where the contribution to GDP of forms of work other than
  employment are expected to be significant, such as in the case of own-use
  production of goods (subsistence agriculture and fishing) or volunteer work,
  the exclusion of participation and time-spent in these productive activities
  can be an important source of bias in the resulting indicators.</p>
