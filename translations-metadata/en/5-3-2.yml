  <p>Definition:</p>

  <p>Proportion of girls and women aged 15-49 years who have undergone female
  genital mutilation/cutting is currently being measured by the proportion of
  girls aged 15-19 years who have undergone female genital
  mutilation/cutting</p>

  <p>Concepts:</p>

  <p>Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) refers to &#x201C;all procedures
  involving partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other
  injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons&quot; (World
  Health Organization, Eliminating Female Genital Mutilation: An interagency
  statement, WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNIFEM, OHCHR, UNHCR, UNECA, UNESCO, UNDP,
  UNAIDS, WHO, Geneva, 2008, p.4)</p>

  <p>Household surveys such as UNICEF-supported MICS and DHS have been
  collecting data on this indicator in low- and middle-income countries since
  the late 1980s. In some countries, such data are also collected through other
  national household surveys.</p>

        <li>UNICEF undertakes a wide consultative process of compiling and assessing data from national sources for the purposes of updating its global databases on the situation of children. Up until 2017, the mechanism UNICEF used to collaborate with national authorities on ensuring data quality and international comparability on key indicators of relevance to children was known as Country Data Reporting on the Indicators for the Goals (CRING).</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>As of 2018, UNICEF launched a new country consultation process with
  national authorities on selected child-related global SDG indicators it is
  custodian or co-custodian to meet emerging standards and guidelines on data
  flows for global reporting of SDG indicators, which place strong emphasis on
  technical rigour, country ownership and use of official data and statistics.
  The consultation process solicited feedback directly from National Statistical
  Offices, as well as other government agencies responsible for official
  statistics, on the compilation of the indicators, including the data sources
  used, and the application of internationally agreed definitions,
  classification and methodologies to the data from that source. Once reviewed,
  feedback is made available to countries on whether or not specific data points
  are accepted, and if not, the reasons why. More details on the consultation
  process can be found in the <a
  href="https://data.unicef.org/resources/resource-type/guidance/">guidance
  note</a>. </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>UNICEF will undertake an annual country consultation likely between
  December and January every year to allow for review and processing of the
  feedback received in order to meet global SDG reporting deadlines.</p>

  <p>FGM/C is a violation of girls&#x2019; and women&#x2019;s human rights.
  There is a large body of literature documenting the adverse health
  consequences of FGM/C over both the short and long term. The practice of FGM/C
  is a direct manifestation of gender inequality </p>

  <p>FGM/C is condemned by a number of international treaties and conventions.
  Since FGM/C is regarded as a traditional practice prejudicial to the health of
  children and is, in most cases, performed on minors, it violates the
  Convention on the Rights of the Child. Existing national legislation in many
  countries also include explicit bans against FGM/C.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>There are existing tools and mechanisms for data collection that countries
  have implemented to monitor the situation with regards to this indicator. The
  modules used to collect information on the circumcision status of girls aged
  0-14 and women aged 15-49 in the DHS and MICS have been fully harmonized.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Number of girls and women aged 15-49 who have undergone FGM/C divided by
  the total number of girls and women aged 15-49 in the population multiplied by
  100</p>

  <p>&#x2022; At country level</p>

  <p>When data for a country are entirely missing, UNICEF does not publish any
  country-level estimate</p>

  <p>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</p>

  <p>Regional aggregates are only published when at least 50 per cent of the
  regional population for the relevant age group are covered by the available
  data.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Global aggregates are weighted averages of all the countries with
  nationally representative prevalence data </p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>Countries gather data on FGM/C through household surveys such as
  UNICEF-supported MICS or Demographic and Health Surveys. In some countries,
  such data are also collected through other national household surveys.</p>

QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>UNICEF maintains the global database on FGM/C that is used for SDG and
  other official reporting. Before the inclusion of any data point in the
  database, it is reviewed by technical focal points at UNICEF headquarters to
  check for consistency and overall data quality. This review is based on a set
  of objective criteria to ensure that only the most recent and reliable
  information are included in the databases. These criteria include the
  following: data sources must include proper documentation; data values must be
  representative at the national population level; data are collected using an
  appropriate methodology (e.g., sampling); data values are based on a
  sufficiently large sample; data conform to the standard indicator definition
  including age group and concepts, to the extent possible; data are plausible
  based on trends and consistency with previously published/reported estimates
  for the indicator.</p>
