  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator Coverage by protected areas of important sites for mountain
  biodiversity shows temporal trends in the mean percentage of each important
  site for mountain biodiversity (i.e., those that contribute significantly to
  the global persistence of biodiversity) that is covered by designated
  protected areas and Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures
  (OECMs).</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>Protected areas, as defined by the IUCN (IUCN; Dudley 2008), are clearly
  defined geographical spaces, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal
  or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with
  associated ecosystem services and cultural values. </p>
UNIT_MEASURE: >-
  <p>Percent (%) (Mean percentage of each mountain Key Biodiversity Area (KBA)
  covered by (i.e. overlapping with) protected areas and/or OECMs.)</p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>Protected Areas are defined as described above by IUCN (IUCN; Dudley 2008)
  and documented in the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA). (<a
  href="http://www.protectedplanet.net">www.protectedplanet.net</a>).</p>

  <p>Importantly, a variety of specific management objectives are recognised
  within this definition, spanning conservation, restoration, and sustainable
  use:</p>

  <p>- Category Ia: Strict nature reserve</p>

  <p>- Category Ib: Wilderness area</p>

  <p>- Category II: National park</p>

  <p>- Category III: Natural monument or feature</p>

  <p>- Category IV: Habitat/species management area</p>

  <p>- Category V: Protected landscape/seascape</p>

  <p>- Category VI: Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources</p>

  <p>The status &quot;designated&quot; is attributed to a protected area when
  the corresponding authority, according to national legislation or common
  practice (e.g., by means of an executive decree or the like), officially
  endorses a document of designation. The designation must be made for the
  purpose of biodiversity conservation, not de facto protection arising because
  of some other activity (e.g., military).</p>

  <p>Data on protected areas are managed in the WDPA (www.protectedplanet.net)
  by UNEP-WCMC.</p>

  <p>OECMs are defined as described above by the Convention on Biological
  Diversity (CBD 2018) and documented in the World Database on Other Effective
  Area-based Conservation Measures (WDOECM) (<a
  href="http://www.protectedplanet.net/en/thematic-areas/oecms">www.protectedplanet.net/en/thematic-areas/oecms</a>).</p>

  <p>OECMs are defined by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) as
  &#x201C;A geographically defined area other than a Protected Area, which is
  governed and managed in ways that achieve positive and sustained long-term
  outcomes for the in-situ conservation of biodiversity, with associated
  ecosystem functions and services and where applicable, cultural, spiritual,
  socio&#x2013;economic, and other locally relevant values&#x201D; (CBD, 2018).
  Data on OECMs are managed in the WDOECM (<a
  href="http://www.protectedplanet.net/en/thematic-areas/oecms">www.protectedplanet.net/en/thematic-areas/oecms</a>)
  by UNEP-WCMC.</p>

  <p>Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) are defined as described below by IUCN (2016)
  and documented in the World Database of KBAs (WDKBA)
  (www.keybiodiversityareas.org/kba-data).</p>

  <p>Sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity
  are identified following globally criteria set out in A Global Standard for
  the Identification of KBAs (IUCN 2016) applied at national levels. KBAs
  encompass (a) Important Bird &amp; Biodiversity Areas, that is, sites
  contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity,
  identified using data on birds, of which more than13,000 sites in total have
  been identified from all of the world&#x2019;s countries (BirdLife
  International 2014, Donald et al. 2018); (b) Alliance for Zero Extinction
  sites (Ricketts et al. 2005), that is, sites holding effectively the entire
  population of at least one species assessed as Critically Endangered or
  Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, of which 853 sites have
  been identified for 1,483 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles,
  freshwater crustaceans, reef-building corals, conifers, cycads and other taxa;
  (c) KBAs identified under an earlier version of the KBA criteria (Langhammer
  et al. 2007), including those identified in Ecosystem Hotspot Profiles
  developed with support of the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund. These three
  subsets are being reassessed using the Global Standard, which unifies these
  approaches along with other mechanisms for identification of important sites
  for other species and ecosystems (IUCN 2016).</p>

  <p>Data on KBAs are managed in the WDKBA
  (www.keybiodiversityareas.org/kba-data) by BirdLife International on behalf of
  the KBA Partnership.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Protected area data are compiled by ministries of environment and other
  ministries responsible for the designation and maintenance of protected areas.
  Protected Areas data for sites designated under the Ramsar Convention and the
  UNESCO World Heritage Convention are collected through the relevant convention
  international secretariats. Protected area data are aggregated globally into
  the WDPA by UNEP-WCMC, according to the mandate for production of the United
  Nations List of Protected Areas (Deguignet et al. 2014). They are disseminated
  through <a href="http://www.protectedplanet.net/">Protected Planet</a>, which
  is jointly managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN and its World Commission on Protected
  Areas (UNEP-WCMC 2016).</p>

  <p>Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs) are collated in
  the WDOECM. This database can be regarded as a sister database to the WDPA as
  it is also hosted on Protected Planet. Furthermore, the databases share many
  of the same fields and have an almost identical workflow; differing only in
  what they list. OECMs are a quickly evolving area of work, as such for the
  latest information on OECMs and the WDOECM please contact UNEP-WCMC. </p>

  <p>KBAs are identified at national scales through multi-stakeholder processes,
  following standard criteria and thresholds. KBAs data are aggregated into the
  <a href="http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/">World Database on </a></p>

  <p><a href="http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/">KBAs</a>, managed by
  BirdLife International. </p>

  process by which KBAs are identified at <a

  <p>The KBA identification process is highly inclusive and consultative: anyone
  with data on the biodiversity importance of a site may propose it as a KBA if
  it meets the <a
  href="https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2016-048.pdf">KBA
  criteria</a>, and consultation with stakeholders at the national level (both
  non-governmental and governmental organisations) is required during the
  proposal process. Any site proposal must undergo independent review. This is
  followed by the official site nomination with full documentation meeting the
  Documentation Standards for KBAs. Sites confirmed by the KBA Secretariat to
  qualify as KBAs are then published on the KBA Website.</p>

  <p>Submission of proposals for KBAs to the WDKBA follows a systematic review
  process to ensure that the KBA criteria have been applied correctly and that
  the sites can be recognised as important for the global persistence of
  biodiversity. Regional Focal Points have been appointed to help KBA proposers
  develop proposals and then ensure they are reviewed independently. Guidance on
  Proposing, Reviewing, Nominating and Confirming sites has been published to
  help guide proposers through the development of proposals and the review
  process, highlighting where they can obtain help in making a proposal. </p>

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The safeguard of important sites is vital for stemming the decline in
  biodiversity and ensuring long term and sustainable use of mountain natural
  resources. The establishment of protected areas is an important mechanism for
  achieving this aim, and this indicator serves as a means of measuring progress
  toward the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of mountain
  ecosystems and their services, in line with obligations under international
  agreements. Importantly, while it can be disaggregated to report on any given
  single ecosystem of interest, it is not restricted to any single ecosystem
  type.</p>

  <p>Levels of access to protected areas vary among the protected area
  management categories. Some areas, such as scientific reserves, are maintained
  in their natural state and closed to any other use. Others are used for
  recreation or tourism, or even open for the sustainable extraction of natural
  resources. In addition to protecting biodiversity, protected areas have high
  social and economic value: supporting local livelihoods; maintaining
  fisheries; harbouring an untold wealth of genetic resources; supporting
  thriving recreation and tourism industries; providing for science, research
  and education; and forming a basis for cultural and other non-material
  values.</p>

  <p>This indicator adds meaningful information to, complements and builds from
  traditionally reported simple statistics of mountain area covered by protected
  areas, computed by dividing the total protected area within a country by the
  total territorial area of the country and multiplying by 100 (e.g., Chape et
  al. </p>

  <p>2005). Such percentage area coverage statistics do not recognise the
  extreme variation of biodiversity importance over space (Rodrigues et al.
  2004), and so risk generating perverse outcomes through the protection of
  areas which are large at the expense of those which require protection.</p>

  <p>The indicator was used to track progress towards the 2011&#x2013;2020
  Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014, CBD 2020a),
  and was used as an indicator towards the Convention on Biological
  Diversity&#x2019;s 2010 Target (Butchart et al. 2010). It has been proposed as
  an indicator for monitoring progress towards the post-2020 Global Biodiversity
  Framework (CBD 2020b).</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Quality control criteria are applied to ensure consistency and
  comparability of the data in the WDPA. New data are validated at UNEP-WCMC
  through a number of tools and translated into the standard data structure of
  the WDPA. Discrepancies between the data in the WDPA and new data are
  minimised by provision of a manual (UNEP-WCMC 2019) and resolved in
  communication with data providers. Similar processes apply for the
  incorporation of data into the WDKBA (BirdLife International 2019).</p>

  <p>The indicator does not measure the effectiveness of protected areas in
  reducing biodiversity loss, which ultimately depends on a range of management
  and enforcement factors not covered by the indicator. A number of initiatives
  are underway to address this limitation. Most notably, numerous mechanisms
  have been developed for assessment of protected area management, which can be
  synthesised into an indicator (Leverington et al. 2010). This is used by the
  Biodiversity Indicators Partnership as a complementary indicator of progress
  towards Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 </p>

  <p>(http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement). However, there may be little
  relationship between these measures and protected area outcomes (Nolte &amp;
  Agrawal 2013). More recently, approaches to &#x201C;green listing&#x201D; have
  started to be developed, to incorporate both management effectiveness and the
  outcomes of protected areas, and these are likely to become progressively
  important as they are tested and applied more broadly.</p>

  <p>Data and knowledge gaps can arise due to difficulties in determining
  whether a site conforms to the IUCN definition of a protected area or the CBD
  definition of an OECM. However, given that both are incorporated into the
  indicator, misclassifications (as one or the other) do not impact the
  calculated indicator value.</p>

  <p>Regarding important sites, the biggest limitation is that site
  identification to date has focused mainly on specific subsets of biodiversity,
  for example birds (for Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas) and highly
  threatened species (for Alliance for Zero Extinction sites). While Important
  Bird and Biodiversity Areas have been documented to be good surrogates for
  biodiversity more generally (Brooks et al. 2001, Pain et al. 2005), the
  application of the unified standard for identification of KBA sites (IUCN
  2016) across different levels of biodiversity (genes, species, ecosystems) and
  different taxonomic groups remains a high priority, building from efforts to
  date (Eken et al. 2004, Knight et al. 2007, Langhammer et al. 2007, Foster et
  al. 2012). Birds now comprise less than 50% of the species for which KBAs have
  been identified, and as KBA identification for other taxa and elements of
  biodiversity proceeds, such bias will become a less important consideration in
  the future.</p>

  <p>KBA identification has been validated for a number of countries and regions
  where comprehensive biodiversity data allow formal calculation of the site
  importance (or &#x201C;irreplaceability&#x201D;) using systematic conservation
  planning techniques (Di Marco et al. 2016, Montesino Pouzols et al. 2014).</p>

  <p>Future developments of the indicator will include: a) expansion of the
  taxonomic coverage of mountain KBAs through application of the KBA standard
  (IUCN 2016) to a wide variety of mountain vertebrates, invertebrates, plants
  and ecosystem type; b) improvements in the data on protected areas by
  continuing to increase the proportion of sites with documented dates of
  designation and with digitised boundary polygons (rather than coordinates);
  and c) increased documentation of Other Effective Area-based Conservation
  Measures in the World Database of OECMs.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>This indicator is calculated from data derived from a spatial overlap
  between digital polygons for protected areas from the World Database on
  Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC &amp; IUCN 2020), digital polygons for Other
  Effective Area-based Conservation Measures from the World Database on OECMs
  and digital polygons for mountain Key Biodiversity Areas (from the World
  Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, including Important Bird and Biodiversity
  Areas, Alliance for Zero Extinction sites, and other Key Biodiversity Areas).
  Sites were classified as mountain Key Biodiversity Areas by undertaking a
  spatial overlap between the Key Biodiversity Area polygons and a mountain
  raster layer (UNEP-WCMC 2002), classifying any Key Biodiversity Area as a
  mountain Key Biodiversity Area where it had &#x2265;5% overlap with the
  mountain layer. The value of the indicator at a given point in time, based on
  data on the year of protected area establishment recorded in the World
  Database on Protected Areas, is computed as the mean percentage of each Key
  Biodiversity Area currently recognised that is covered by protected areas
  and/or Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures.</p>

  <p>Protected areas lacking digital boundaries in the World Database of
  Protected Areas, and those sites with a status of &#x2018;proposed&#x2019; or
  &#x2018;not reported&#x2019; are omitted. Degazetted sites are not kept in the
  WDPA and are also not included. Man and Biosphere Reserves are also excluded
  as these often contain potentially unprotected areas. Year of protected area
  establishment is unknown for ~12% of protected areas in the World Database on
  Protected Areas, generating uncertainty around changing protected area
  coverage over time. To reflect this uncertainty, a year was randomly assigned
  from another protected area within the same country, and then this procedure
  repeated 1,000 times, with the median plotted. </p>

  <p>Prior to 2017, the indicator was presented as the percentage of Key
  Biodiversity Areas completely covered by protected areas. However, it is now
  presented as the mean % of each Key Biodiversity Area that is covered by
  protected areas in order to better reflect trends in protected area coverage
  for countries or regions with few or no Key Biodiversity Areas that are
  completely covered.</p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>Protected Areas and OECMs are validated through dialogue with the governing
  authority, who signs a data contributor agreement that these sites are, to the
  best of their knowledge, an accurate depiction of the sites in question. Over
  time the data for sites may improve or other aspects of the sites may change,
  as and when this occurs a further data sharing agreement is required by the
  site&#x2019;s governing authority.</p>

  <p>Proposed KBAs undergo detailed checking by Regional Focal Points, formal
  Review of KBA Proposals by independent Reviewers, and validation of Nominated
  KBAs by the KBAs Secretariat. For further information, see the Guidance on
  Proposing, Reviewing, Nominating and Confirming KBAs available in KBA
  Secretariat (2019) at <a
  href="http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/assets/35687f50ac0bcad155ab17447b48885a">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/assets/35687f50ac0bcad155ab17447b48885a</a>.</p>

  <p>When the indicators of protected area coverage of KBAs are updated each
  year, the updated indicators (and underlying numbers of protected areas,
  OECMs, and KBAs) are made available for review by countries prior to
  submission to the SDG Indicators Database. This is achieved through updating
  the country profiles in the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (<a
  href="https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles">https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles</a>)
  and circulating these for consultation and review to CBD National Focal
  Points, SDG National Statistical Office Focal Points, and IUCN State
  Members.</p>

  <p>When the indicators of protected area coverage of Key Biodiversity Areas
  are updated each year, the updated indicators (and underlying numbers of
  protected areas, Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures, and Key
  Biodiversity Areas) are made available for review by countries prior to
  submission to the SDG Indicators Database. This is achieved through updating
  the country profiles in the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (<a

ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>No adjustments are made to the index with respect to harmonization of
  breakdowns or for compliance with specific international or national
  definitions.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>

  <p>Data are available for protected areas and KBAs in all of the
  world&#x2019;s countries, and so no imputation or estimation of national level
  data is necessary.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>

  <p>Global indicators of protected area coverage of important sites for
  biodiversity are calculated as the mean percentage of each KBA that is covered
  by protected areas and Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures. The
  data are generated from all countries, and so while there is uncertainty
  around the data, there are no missing values as such and so no need for
  imputation or estimation.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Regional indices are calculated as the mean percentage of each KBA in the
  region covered by (i.e. overlapping with) protected areas and/or OECMs: in
  other words, the percentage of each KBA covered by these designations,
  averaged over all KBAs in the particular region.</p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p><strong><em>PAs</em></strong></p>

  <p>Data on protected areas are submitted by government agencies to the WDPA
  and disseminated through Protected Planet. The WDPA has its origins in a 1959
  UN mandate when the United Nations Economic and Social Council called for a
  list of national parks and equivalent reserves Resolution 713 (XXVIII). </p>

  <p>Protected areas data are therefore compiled directly from government
  agencies, regional hubs and other authoritative sources in the absence of a
  government source. All records have a unique metadata identifier (MetadataID)
  which links the spatial database to the Source table where all sources are
  described. The data is collated and standardised following the WDPA Data
  Standards and validated with the source. The process of collation, validation
  and publication of data as well as protocols and the WDPA data standards are
  regularly updated in the WDPA User Manual (<a
  href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual</a>)
  made available through www.protectedplanet.net where all spatial data and the
  Source table are also published every month and can be downloaded. The WDPA
  User Manual (published in English, Spanish, and French) provides guidance to
  countries on how to submit protected areas data to the WDPA, the benefits of
  providing such data, and the data standards and quality checks that are
  performed. </p>

  comprises the standard recommendations available to countries in the
  identification of KBAs. Guidelines for using A global standard for the
  identification of KBAs are available at

  <p>A summary of the process by which KBAs are identified is available at <a
  href="http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/working-with-kbas/proposing-updating">www.keybiodiversityareas.org/working-with-kbas/proposing-updating</a>.</p>

  <p>The KBA identification process is highly inclusive, consultative and
  nationally driven. Anyone with appropriate data may propose a site as a KBA,
  although consultation with relevant stakeholders at the local and national
  level is required when identifying the site and needs to be documented in the
  proposal. In order to propose a site as a KBA, a proposer must apply the KBA
  criteria to data on biodiversity elements (species and ecosystems) at the
  site. Associated with the proposal process is the need to delineate the site
  accurately so that its boundaries are clear. Although anyone with appropriate
  scientific data may propose a site to qualify as a KBA, wide consultation with
  stakeholders at the national level (both non-governmental and governmental
  organizations) is required during the proposal process. The formal proposal is
  then made using a proposal process that ensures there is an independent review
  of the proposal before a site is incorporated in the WDKBA. This is important
  given that KBA status of a site may lead to changes in actions of governments,
  private sector companies and other institutions following consultation as
  appropriate. </p>

  <p>KBA identification builds off the existing network of KBAs, including those
  identified as (a) Important Bird &amp; Biodiversity Areas through the BirdLife
  Partnership of over 115 national organisations
  (https://www.birdlife.org/who-we-are/), (b) Alliance for Zero Extinction sites
  by 93 national and international organisations in the Alliance (<a
  href="http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html">http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html</a>),
  and (c) other KBAs by civil society organisations supported by the Critical
  Ecosystem Partnership Fund in developing ecosystem profiles, named in each of
  the profiles listed here (<a
  href="http://www.cepf.net">http://www.cepf.net</a> ), with new data
  strengthening and expanding expand the network of these sites.</p>

  <p>The main steps of the KBA identification process are the following: </p>

  <ol>
    <li>submission of Expressions of Intent to identify a KBA to Regional Focal Points; </li>
    <li>Proposal Development process, in which proposers compile relevant data and documentation and consult national experts, including organizations that have already identified KBAs in the country, either through national KBA Coordination Groups or independently;</li>
    <li>review of proposed KBAs by Independent Expert Reviewers, verifying the accuracy of information within their area of expertise; and</li>
    <li>a Site Nomination phase comprising the submission of all the relevant documentation for verification by the KBAs Secretariat. Sites confirmed by the KBAs Secretariat to qualify as KBAs are then published on the KBAs website (<a href="http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home</a>).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Once a KBA is identified, monitoring of its qualifying features and its
  conservation status is important. Proposers, reviewers and those undertaking
  monitoring can join the KBAs Community to exchange their experiences, case
  studies and best practice examples.</p>

  <p>The R code for calculating protected area coverage of KBAs is documented in
  Simkins et al. (2020). </p>
QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>For protected areas and OECMs, please see the section on validation.
  Ensuring the WDPA and WDOECM remain an accurate and true depiction of reality
  is a never-ending task; however, over time the quality of the data (e.g. the
  proportion of sites with defined boundaries) is increasing.</p>

  <p>For KBAs, see above and below, plus the guidance on Proposing, Reviewing,
  Nominating and Confirming KBAs which is available in KBA Secretariat (2019) at
  <a
  href="http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/assets/35687f50ac0bcad155ab17447b48885a">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/assets/35687f50ac0bcad155ab17447b48885a</a>.
  Data quality is ensured through wide stakeholder engagement in the KBA
  proposal process, data checking by Regional Focal Points, formal Review of KBA
  Proposals by independent Reviewers, and validation of Nominations by the KBAs
  Secretariat. Furthermore, an independent KBA Standards and Appeals Committee
  ensures the correct application of the Global Standard for the identification
  of KBAs, and oversees a formal Procedure for handling of appeals against the
  identification of KBAs (see
  http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/assets/1b388c918e14c5f4c3d7a0237eb0d366).</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>Information on the process of how protected area data are collected,
  standardised and published is available in the WDPA User Manual at: <a
  href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual</a>
  which is available in English, French and Spanish. Specific guidance is
  provided at <a
  href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas</a>
  on, for example, predefined fields or look up tables in the WDPA: <a
  href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-lookup-tables">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-lookup-tables</a>,
  how WDPA records are coded how international designations and regional
  designations data is collected, how regularly is the database updated, and how
  to perform protected areas coverage statistics. </p>

  <p>Data quality in the process of identifying KBAs is ensured through
  processes established by the <a
  href="https://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/working-with-kbas/programme/partnership">KBA
  Partnership</a> and KBA Secretariat. Data quality is ensured through wide
  stakeholder engagement in the KBA proposal process, data checking by Regional
  Focal Points, formal Review of KBA Proposals by independent Reviewers, and
  validation of Nominations by the KBA Secretariat. </p>

  <p>In addition, the Chairs of the IUCN Species Survival Commission and World
  Commission on Protected Areas (both of whom are elected by the IUCN Membership
  of governments and non-governmental organisations), appoint the Chair of an
  independent KBA Standards and Appeals Committee, which ensures the correct
  application of the Global Standard for the identification of KBA, and oversees
  a formal Procedure for handling of appeals against the identification of KBAs
  (see
  http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/assets/1b388c918e14c5f4c3d7a0237eb0d366).</p>

  <p>Before submission to the UN SDG Indicators database the annually updated
  indicators of coverage of KBAs by protected areas and Other Effective
  Area-based Conservation Measures are incorporated into updated Country
  Profiles on the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (<a
  href="https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles">https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles</a>)
  and then sent for consultation to National Focal Points of the Convention on
  Biological Diversity (<a

  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>This indicator has been classified by the IAEG-SDGs as Tier 1. Current data
  are available for all countries in the world, and these are updated on an
  ongoing basis. Index values for each country are available in the UN SDG
  Indicators Database <a
  href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/">https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/</a>.
  Graphs of Protected area coverage of Key Biodiversity Areas are also available
  for each country in the BIP Indicators Dashboard (<a
  href="https://bipdashboard.natureserve.org/bip/SelectCountry.html">https://bipdashboard.natureserve.org/bip/SelectCountry.html</a>),
  and the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool Country Profiles (<a
  href="https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles">https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles</a>).</p>

  <p>Underlying data on protected areas and Other Effective Area-based
  Conservation Measures are available at <a
  href="http://www.protectedplanet.net">www.protectedplanet.net</a>. Data on Key
  Biodiversity Areas are available at <a
  href="http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org">www.keybiodiversityareas.org</a>.
  Data on subsets of KBAs are available for Important Bird and Biodiversity
  Areas at <a
  href="http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/search">http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/search</a>
  and for Alliance for Zero Extinction sites at https://zeroextinction.org.</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>Given that data for the global indicator are compiled at national levels,
  it is straightforward to disaggregate to national and regional levels (e.g.,
  Han et al. 2014), or conversely to aggregate to the global level. Key
  Biodiversity Areas span all ecosystem types through the marine environment
  (Edgar et al. 2008) and beyond. The indicator can therefore be reported in
  combination across marine systems along with terrestrial or freshwater
  systems, or disaggregated among them. However, individual Key Biodiversity
  Areas can encompass marine, terrestrial, and freshwater systems
  simultaneously, and so determining the results is not simply additive. </p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>National processes provide the data that are incorporated into the WDPA,
  the WDOECM, and the World Database of KBAs, so there are very few
  discrepancies between national indicators and the global one. One minor source
  of difference is that the WDPA incorporates internationally-designated
  protected areas (e.g., UNESCO World Heritage sites, Ramsar sites, etc), a few
  of which are not considered by their sovereign nations to be protected areas.
  </p>

  <p>Note that because countries do not submit comprehensive data on degazetted
  protected areas to the WDPA, earlier values of the indictor may marginally
  underestimate coverage. Furthermore, there is also a lag between the point at
  which a protected area is designated on the ground and the point at which it
  is reported to the WDPA. As such, current or recent coverage may also be
  underestimated.</p>
