  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>Parties to the <strong>Basel Convention</strong> have an obligation to
  present an annual national report as provided for by Article 13, paragraph 3
  in order to enable monitoring of the implementation of the Basel Convention by
  its Parties. The reports are to contain, inter alia, information regarding
  transboundary movements of hazardous wastes or other wastes in which Parties
  have been involved, including the amount of hazardous wastes and other wastes
  exported, their category, characteristics, destination, any transit country
  and disposal method as stated on the response to notification, the amount of
  hazardous wastes and other wastes imported in their category, characteristics,
  origin, and disposal methods; information on accidents occurring during the
  transboundary movement and disposal of hazardous wastes and other wastes and
  on the measures undertaken to deal with them; information on disposal options
  operated within the area of their national jurisdiction; and other information
  as per reporting format.</p>

  <p>Import responses under the <strong>Rotterdam Convention</strong> are the
  decisions provided by Parties indicating whether or not they will consent to
  import the chemicals listed in Annex III of the Convention and subject to the
  prior informed consent (PIC) procedure. Article 10 of the Rotterdam Convention
  sets out the obligations of Parties with respect to the future import of
  chemicals listed in Annex III.</p>

  <p>Under the <strong>Stockholm Convention</strong>, a Party has an obligation
  to report on the measures it has taken to implement the provisions of the
  Convention and on the effectiveness of such measures in meeting the objectives
  of the Convention. The national reports include statistical data on the total
  quantities of production, import and export of each of the chemicals listed in
  Annex A and Annex B or a reasonable estimate of such data; and to the extent
  practicable, a list of the States from which it has imported each substance
  and the States to which it has exported each substance. A National
  Implementation Plan under the Stockholm Convention is a plan explaining how a
  Party is going to implement the obligations under the Convention and make
  efforts to put such a plan into operation (<a
  href="http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/Repository/conf/UNEP-POPS-CONF-4-AppendixII.5206ab9e-ca67-42a7-afee-9d90720553c8.pdf#Article%207">Article
  7</a>). Changes in the obligations arising from amendments to the Convention
  or its annexes, for example when a new chemical is listed into the annexes of
  the Convention, will require that a Party is to review and update its
  implementation plan, and transmit the updated plan to the Conference of the
  Parties (COP) within two years of the entry into force of the amendment for
  it, consistent with paragraph 1 (b) of the Convention (according to paragraph
  7 of the annex to decision SC-1/12). </p>

  <p>The <strong>Minamata Convention</strong> requires, under its article 17,
  paragraph 4, that each Party designates a National Focal Point for the
  exchange of information under it, including with regard to the consent of
  importing Parties under Article 3. Pursuant to Article 21 of the Minamata
  Convention, each party to the Convention shall report to the COP on the
  measures it has taken to implement the provisions of the Convention, on the
  effectiveness of such measures and on possible challenges in meeting the
  objectives of the Convention. In decision MC-1/8 on the Timing and format of
  reporting by the Parties, the COP at its first meeting (2017) agreed on the
  full format of reporting and decided that each Party shall report every four
  years using the full format and report every two years on four questions
  marked by an asterisk in the full format. The COP further decided on the
  following timing with regards to the short and full reporting: 31 December
  2019 as the deadline for the first short national report; 31 December 2021 as
  the deadline for the first full national report. </p>

  <p>The <strong>Montreal Protocol</strong> requires, under its Article 7, that
  each Party provides to the Secretariat for each controlled substance
  statistical data on its annual production, amounts used for feedstocks,
  amounts destroyed by technologies approved by the Parties, imports from and
  exports to Parties and non-Parties respectively and amount of the controlled
  substance listed in Annex E used for quarantine and pre-shipment applications,
  for the year during which provisions concerning those substances entered into
  force for that Party and for each year thereafter. Each Party shall also
  provide to the Secretariat statistical data on its annual emissions of
  trifluoromethane (HFC-23) per facility. The calculation of control levels is
  provided in Article 3 of the Protocol. This reporting enables monitoring of
  the implementation of the Protocol, and compliance with the control measures
  under the protocol. Additionally, under Article 4B, each party is required to
  establish and implement a system for licensing the import and export of new,
  used, recycled and reclaimed controlled substances. Each Party is required,
  within three months of the date of introducing its licensing system, to report
  to the Secretariat on the establishment and operation of that system. </p><div

INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p><strong>Basel Convention</strong>: Pursuant to article 5 of the Basel
  Convention, Parties are required to designate or establish one or more
  competent authorities and one focal point to facilitate the implementation of
  the Convention. Parties also have an obligation to inform the Secretariat of
  any changes regarding designations made by them. The Conference of the Parties
  (COP) has adopted a standard form for notification of designation of contacts
  (decision BC-11/21), which Parties are requested to use to transmit
  information to the Secretariat including modifications. </p>

  <p>A list of competent authorities and focal points to the Basel Convention is
  maintained and regularly updated on <a
  href="http://www.basel.int/Countries/CountryContacts/tabid/1342/Default.aspx">the
  Convention website</a>.</p>

  <p>To enable monitoring of the implementation of the Basel Convention by its
  Parties and to present reports on this matter to the COP on a regular basis,
  the Convention establishes a mechanism for Parties to transmit information
  about implementation of the Convention. According to Article 13, the Parties,
  consistent with national laws and regulations, shall transmit, through the
  Secretariat, to the COP established under Article 15, before the end of each
  calendar year<strong><u>, a report</u></strong> on the previous calendar
  year.</p>

  <p>Article 13 mandates the Secretariat to receive and disseminate this and
  other types of information.</p>

  <p><strong>Rotterdam Convention:</strong> Pursuant to Article 4 of the
  Rotterdam Convention, each Party is required to designate one or more national
  authorities that shall be authorized to act on its behalf in the performance
  of the administrative functions required by the Convention. The Secretariat
  also communicates with an Official Contact Point (OCP) of a Party on official
  issues. Here too, the COP has adopted a standard form for notification of
  designation of contacts (decision RC-6/13), which Parties are requested to use
  to transmit information to the Secretariat. A contacts database is available
  on <a
  href="http://www.pic.int/Countries/CountryContacts/tabid/3282/language/en-US/Default.aspx">the
  Rotterdam Convention website</a>. </p>

  <p>Article 10 of the Convention sets out the obligations of Parties with
  respect to the future import of chemicals listed in Annex III. Parties have an
  ongoing obligation to submit to the Secretariat, as soon as possible and in
  any event no later than nine months after the date of dispatch of a decision
  guidance document, their <strong><u>import response</u></strong><sup><a
  href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[2]</a></sup> (whether a final or
  interim response) concerning the future import of the chemical. If a Party
  modifies its response, it has an obligation to immediately submit the revised
  response to the Secretariat.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Article 14 in addition to other relevant Articles gives the mandate to the
  Secretariat to facilitate the information exchange. The Secretariat maintains
  various databases of information on the Convention website based on
  transmissions from Parties e.g. country profiles, database of import
  responses, national legislation collection.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Stockholm Convention:</strong> Pursuant to Article 9 of the
  Stockholm Convention, each Party shall designate a national focal point for
  the exchange of the information referred to in paragraph 1 of article 9.
  Pursuant to decision <a
  href="http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/download.aspx?d=UNEP-POPS-COP.2-SC-2-16.English.PDF">SC-2/16</a>
  of the second meeting of the COP of the Stockholm Convention, Parties are
  invited to nominate OCPs. A revised harmonised form for notification of
  designation of contacts has also been adopted by the COP to the Stockholm
  Convention for notification of contacts, including modifications (decision
  SC-6/26). The Secretariat also maintains for this <a
  href="http://chm.pops.int/Countries/CountryContacts/tabid/304/Default.aspx">Convention
  a database of country contacts</a>.</p>

  <p>Parties to the Stockholm Convention are required to develop, endeavour to
  implement, update and review as appropriate, a plan explaining how they are
  going to implement the obligations under the Convention (Article 7)
  (&#x201C;national implementation plans&#x201D;). The plans are made available
  on the Convention website. </p>

  <p>Furthermore, Article 9 specifies that the Parties facilitate or undertake
  the exchange of information relevant to the reduction or elimination of the
  production, use and release of persistent organic pollutants and alternatives
  to them directly or through the Secretariat. </p>

  <p>A national report contains information on the measures taken by a Party in
  implementing the Stockholm Convention. The information provided in the
  national reports is one of the main references to be used for the evaluation
  of the effectiveness of the Convention in accordance with its Article 16. The
  COP decided at its first meeting that <strong><u>national reports</u></strong>
  shall be submitted every four years. The OCP has the authority to submit a
  national report to the Secretariat.</p>

  <p><strong>Minamata Convention:</strong> Parties requested the Secretariat of
  the Minamata Convention to facilitate cooperation in the exchange of
  information referred to in Article 17, including with respect to the
  designation of national focal points, pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article 17 of
  the Minamata Convention. Article 24 of the Convention further includes in the
  functions of the Secretariat, <em>inter alia</em>, to assist Parties in the
  exchange of information related to the implementation of the Convention, and
  to prepare and make to the Parties periodic reports based on information
  received pursuant to Article 21.</p>

  <p><strong>Montreal Protocol:</strong> Under the Montreal Protocol, the role
  of the Secretariat is stipulated in Article 12 of the Protocol including the
  obligation to receive data provided pursuant to Article 7. Additionally, under
  Article 4B, each Party is required, within three months of the date of
  introducing its licensing system, to report to the Secretariat on the
  establishment and operation of that system. </p>

  <p>Compliance of the Parties with their reporting obligations is considered by
  an Implementation Committee established under the Protocol&#x2019;s
  Non-Compliance Procedure and is determined by the Meeting of the Parties based
  on the Committee&#x2019;s recommendations (<a
  href="https://ozone.unep.org/list-of-implementation-committee-recommendations">https://ozone.unep.org/list-of-implementation-committee-recommendations</a>).</p><div
  class="footnotes"><div><sup class="footnote-number" id="footnote-3">2</sup><p>
  The import response may consist of an interim response that is not necessarily
  a decision, see for example Article 10(4)(b)(ii)-(iv). <a
  href="#footnote-ref-3">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The proposed indicator is process-oriented, focusing on compliance with the
  obligations that contribute to the overall target of achieving the
  environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their
  life cycle. </p>

  <p>It does not measure the quantity of chemicals in media and does not
  quantify adverse impacts on human health and the environment. The MEAs,
  however, were developed and adopted to address the most urgent challenges for
  human health and the environment and therefore, through the implementation of
  MEAs progress will be made to reduce release to air, water and soil as well as
  presence of hazardous chemicals in products. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The transmission of information as required by the five Conventions follows
  a different timing. This is the reason why the reporting to this indicator has
  been scheduled for 5-year cycles, which would allow capturing the compliance
  of Parties with the transmission of information of all the Conventions.</p>

  <p>Please also note that the timing for submission of reporting for the
  Minamata Convention has been agreed upon under decision MC-1/8, with the
  deadlines for the short and full reporting: 31 December 2019 as the deadline
  for the first short national report and 31 December 2021 as the deadline for
  the first full national report. Based on the prescribed deadlines, it
  therefore follows that for the first short reports the reporting period covers
  16 August 2017 (the date of entry into force of the Convention) to 31 December
  2018 (to be submitted by 31 December 2019), and for the first full reports the
  reporting period covers 16 August 2017 to 31 December 2020 (to be submitted by
  31 December 2021). The cycle will then be repeated, with the subsequent short
  reports covering 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2022 and the subsequent full
  reports covering 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2024, and so on.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>In the following methodology, reporting is to take place in 2017 for the
  period 2010-2014, in 2020 for the period 2015-2019, in 2025 for the period
  2020-2024 and in 2030 for the period 2025-2029. Reporting parameters include
  the following: </p>

  <p>The Country Score depends on the amount of information that is sent to the
  Conventions&#x2019; Secretariat, and is calculated as follows (and
  communicated by the Secretariats):</p>

  <p><strong><u>Basel Convention:</u></strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Designation of the Focal Point and one or more Competent Authorities (1 point);</li>
    <li>Submission of the annual national reports during the reporting period (1 point per report).</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong><u>Rotterdam Convention:</u></strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Designation of the Designated National Authority(ies) and Official contact point (1 point);</li>
    <li>Submission of the import responses during the reporting period (0.2 point per import response).</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong><u>Stockholm Convention:</u></strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Designation of the Stockholm Convention official contact point and national focal point (1 point);</li>
    <li>Submission of the national implementation plan (1 point);</li>
    <li>Submission of the revised national implementation plan(s) addressing the amendments adopted by the Conference of the Parties within the reporting period (1 point per revised and updated plan)<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4">[3]</a></sup></sup>;</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong><u>Montreal Protocol:</u></strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Compliance with annual reporting requirements for production and consumption of controlled substances under Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol (15 points per report);</li>
    <li>Submission of information on Licensing systems under (Article 4B of) the Montreal Protocol (5 points).</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong><u>Minamata Convention:</u></strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Designation of a national focal point (Article 17) (5 points);</li>
    <li>Submission of national report (Article 21) (15 points).</li>
  </ol>

  Parties adopted data reporting forms to guide them on the information to be

QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>The <strong>Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm (BRS) Secretariat</strong>
  reviews the national reports for completeness and correctness and communicates
  with Parties with a view of addressing identified gaps, where possible.</p>

  <p>Under the Committee administering the Mechanism for Promoting
  Implementation and Compliance (ICC), which is a subsidiary body of the Basel
  Convention, there is a standing area of work on the national reporting which
  aims at improving timely and complete national reporting under paragraph 3 of
  Article 13 of the Convention. Activities in the biennium 2020-2021 include,
  inter alia, classifying and, as appropriate, publishing information on
  Parties&#x2019; compliance with their annual national reporting obligations
  for 2016 and 2017 based on the assumptions, criteria and categories adopted by
  the Conference of the Parties (COP) at its thirteenth meeting and the targets
  adopted by the COP at its fourteenth meeting; developing recommendations on
  the revision of targets referred to in paragraph 13 of decision BC-14/15 for
  the reports due for 2018 and subsequent years; and with a view to increasing
  the completeness and timeliness of national reporting under paragraph 3 of
  Article 13, exploring how individual Parties can integrate national reporting
  needs under the Basel Convention into the United Nations Development
  Assistance Framework.</p>

  <p><strong>The Minamata Secretariat</strong> uses an online reporting system
  with a database for collecting and managing the reported information. This is
  complemented by an internal system to (i) review the completeness and
  correctness of the reports received; and (ii) inform Parties about the
  outcomes of such review before the reports are published on the Minamata
  Convention website.</p>

  <p><strong>The Secretariat for the Montreal Protocol</strong> uses an online
  reporting system with a database for collecting and managing the reported
  information. The system includes a variety of checks and validation rules to
  ensure completeness and consistency of the reported information.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>For the <strong>Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions</strong> the
  Electronic Reporting System is the tool to be used by Parties to submit their
  national reports. For guidelines, please see the responses to the question in
  4(h).</p>

  <p>A reporting format for the <strong>Minamata Convention</strong> has been
  adopted by the first Conference of the Parties (COP) for the submission of
  national reports pursuant to Article 21. The Secretariat drafted guidance for
  the short reports (4 questions) to assist Parties. In decision MC-3/13, on
  guidance for completing the national reporting format, the COP, recognized the
  need for a complete and consistent national reporting to provide information
  for the effectiveness evaluation and for supporting compliance, and requested
  the secretariat to prepare draft guidance for the full national reporting
  format to clarify the information being sought. A draft of the Guidance was
  circulated on 20 May 2021, and has been provisionally used to inform the
  completion of the first full national reports due by 31 December 2021. The
  draft guidance is under consideration at the fourth meeting of the COP of the
  Minamata Convention in March 2022. . An online reporting tool was developed
  and launched by the Secretariat on 7 September 2021 to assist Parties and
  facilitate collecting the information for the reports. Under the Minamata
  Convention, the responsibility for quality assurance of the submitted data and
