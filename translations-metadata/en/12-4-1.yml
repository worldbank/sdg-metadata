  <p>Concepts:</p>

  <p>Parties: countries that have ratified, accepted, approved or accessed a
  convention.</p>

  <p>Information: Parties to the Basel Convention have an obligation to present
  an annual national report as provided for by Article 13, paragraph 3 in order
  to enable monitoring of the implementation of the Basel Convention by its
  Parties. The reports are to contain, inter alia, Information regarding
  transboundary movements of hazardous wastes or other wastes in which Parties
  have been involved, including the amount of hazardous wastes and other wastes
  exported, their category, characteristics, destination, any transit country
  and disposal method as stated on the response to notification, the amount of
  hazardous wastes and other wastes imported their category, characteristics,
  origin, and disposal methods; information on accidents occurring during the
  transboundary movement and disposal of hazardous wastes and other wastes and
  on the measures undertaken to deal with them; information on disposal options
  operated within the area of their national jurisdiction; and other information
  as per reporting format.</p>

  <p>Import responses under the Rotterdam Convention are the decisions provided
  by Parties indicating whether or not they will consent to import the chemicals
  listed in Annex III of the Convention and subject to the prior informed
  consent (PIC) procedure. Article 10 of the Rotterdam Convention sets out the
  obligations of Parties with respect to the future import of chemicals listed
  in Annex III.</p>

  <p>Under the Stockholm Convention a Party has an obligation to report on the
  measures it has taken to implement the provisions of the Convention and on the
  effectiveness of such measures in meeting the objectives of the Convention.
  The national reports include statistical data on the total quantities of
  production, import and export of each of the chemicals listed in Annex A and
  Annex B or a reasonable estimate of such data; and to the extent practicable,
  a list of the States from which it has imported each such substance and the
  States to which it has exported each such substance. A National Implementation
  Plan under the Stockholm Convention is a plan explaining how a Party is going
  to implement the obligations under the Convention and make efforts to put such
  a plan into operation (<a
  href="http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/Repository/conf/UNEP-POPS-CONF-4-AppendixII.5206ab9e-ca67-42a7-afee-9d90720553c8.pdf#Article%207">Article
  7</a>). Changes in the obligations arising from amendments to the Convention
  or its annexes, for example when a new chemical is listed into the annexes of
  the Convention, a Party will review and update its implementation plan, and
  transmit the updated plan to the Conference of the Parties within two years of
  the entry into force of the amendment for it, consistent with paragraph 1 (b)
  of the Convention (according to paragraph 7 of the annex to decision SC-1/12).
  </p>

  <p>The Minamata Convention requires, under its article 17, paragraph 4, that
  each Party designates a National Focal Point for the exchange of information
  under it, including with regard to the consent of importing Parties under
  Article 3. </p>

  <p>Pursuant to Article 21 of the Minamata Convention on Mercury, each party to
  the Convention shall report to the Conference of the Parties on the measures
  it has taken to implement the provisions of the Convention, on the
  effectiveness of such measures and on possible challenges in meeting the
  objectives of the Convention. In decision MC-1/8 on the Timing and format of
  reporting by the Parties, the Conference of the Parties at its first meeting
  (2017) agreed on the full format of reporting and decided that each Party
  shall report every four years using the full format and report every two years
  on four questions marked by an asterisk in the full format. The Conference of
  the Parties further decided on the following timing with regards to the short
  and full reporting: 31 December 2019 as the deadline for first biennial short
  report; 31 December 2021 as the deadline for first full report.</p>

  <p>The Montreal Protocol requires, under its Article 7, that each Party
  provides to the Secretariat for each controlled substance statistical data on
  its annual production, amounts used for feedstocks, amounts destroyed by
  technologies approved by the Parties, imports from and exports to Parties and
  non-Parties respectively and amount of the controlled substance listed in
  Annex E used for quarantine and pre-shipment applications, for the year during
  which provisions concerning those substances entered into force for that Party
  and for each year thereafter. Each Party shall also provide to the Secretariat
  statistical data on its annual emissions of HFC-23 per facility. The
  calculation of control levels is provided in Article 3 of the Protocol. This
  reporting enables monitoring of the implementation of the Protocol, and
  compliance with the control measures under the protocol.</p>

  <p>Additionally, under Article 4B, each party is required to establish and
  implement a system for licensing the import and export of new, used, recycled
  and reclaimed controlled substances. Each Party is required, within three
  months of the date of introducing its licensing system, to report to the
  Secretariat on the establishment and operation of that system. </p><div

INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p><strong>Basel Convention</strong>: Pursuant to article 5 of the Basel
  Convention, Parties are required to designate or establish one or more
  competent authorities and one focal point to facilitate the implementation of
  the Convention. Parties also have an obligation to inform the Secretariat of
  any changes regarding designations made by them. The Conference of the Parties
  has adopted a standard form for notification of designation of contacts
  (decision BC-11/21), which Parties are requested to use to transmit
  information to the Secretariat including modifications . </p>

  <p>A list of competent authorities and focal points to the Basel Convention is
  maintained and regularly updated on the Convention website: <a
  href="http://www.basel.int/Countries/CountryContacts/tabid/1342/Default.aspx">http://www.basel.int/Countries/CountryContacts/tabid/1342/Default.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>In order to enable monitoring of the implementation of the Basel Convention
  by its Parties and to present reports on this matter to the Conference of
  Parties on a regular basis, the Convention establishes a mechanism for Parties
  to transmit information about implementation of the Convention. According to
  Article 13, the Parties, consistent with national laws and regulations, shall
  transmit, through the Secretariat, to the Conference of the Parties
  established under Article 15, before the end of each calendar year<strong><u>,
  a report</u></strong> on the previous calendar year.</p>

  <p>Article 13 mandates the Secretariat to receive and disseminate this and
  other types of information.</p>

  <p><strong>Rotterdam Convention:</strong> Pursuant to Article 4 of the
  Rotterdam Convention, each Party is required to designate one or more national
  authorities that shall be authorized to act on its behalf in the performance
  of the administrative functions required by the Convention. The Secretariat
  also communicates with an Official Contact Point (OCP) of a Party on official
  issues. Here too the Conference of the Parties has adopted a standard form for
  notification of designation of contacts (decision RC-6/13), which Parties are
  requested to use to transmit information to the Secretariat. A contacts
  database is available on the Rotterdam Convention website at
  http://www.pic.int/Countries/CountryContacts/tabid/3282/language/en-US/Default.aspx</p>

  <p>Article 10 of the Convention sets out the obligations of Parties with
  respect to the future import of chemicals listed in Annex III. Parties have an
  ongoing obligation to submit to the Secretariat, as soon as possible and in
  any event no later than nine months after the date of dispatch of a decision
  guidance document, their <strong><u>import response</u></strong> <sup><a
  href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[2]</a></sup>(whether a final or
  interim response) concerning the future import of the chemical. If a Party
  modifies its response, it has an obligation to immediately submit the revised
  response to the Secretariat.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Article 14 in addition to other relevant Articles gives the mandate to the
  Secretariat to facilitate the information exchange. The Secretariat maintains
  various databases of information on the Convention website based on
  transmissions from Parties e.g. country profiles, database of import
  responses, national legislation collection.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Stockholm Convention:</strong> Pursuant to Article 9 of the
  Stockholm Convention, each Party shall designate a national focal point for
  the exchange of the information referred to in paragraph 1 of article 9.
  Pursuant to decision <a
  href="http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/download.aspx?d=UNEP-POPS-COP.2-SC-2-16.English.PDF">SC-2/16</a>
  of the second meeting of the Conference of the Parties of the Stockholm
  Convention, Parties are invited to nominate Official Contact Points. A revised
  harmonised form for notification of designation of contacts has also been
  adopted by the Conference of the Parties to the Stockholm Convention for
  notification of contacts, including modifications (decision SC-6/26). The
  Secretariat also maintains for this Convention a database of country contacts
  at http://chm.pops.int/Countries/CountryContacts/tabid/304/Default.aspx</p>

  <p>Parties to the Stockholm Convention are required to develop, endeavour to
  implement, update and review as appropriate, a plan explaining how they are
  going to implement the obligations under the Convention (Article 7)
  (&#x201C;national implementation plans&#x201D;). The plans are made available
  on the Convention website. </p>

  <p>Furthermore Article 9 specifies that the Parties facilitate or undertake
  the exchange of information relevant to the reduction or elimination of the
  production, use and release of persistent organic pollutants and alternatives
  to them directly and or through the Secretariat. </p>

  <p>A national report contains information on the measures taken by a Party in
  implementing the Stockholm Convention. The information provided in the
  national reports is one of the main references to be used for the evaluation
  of the effectiveness of the Convention in accordance with its Article 16. The
  Conference of the Parties (COP) decided at its first meeting that
  <strong><u>national reports</u></strong> shall be submitted every four years.
  The Official Contact Point has the authority to submit a national report to
  the Secretariat.</p>

  <p>Parties requested the Secretariat of the Minamata Convention to facilitate
  cooperation in the exchange of information referred to Article 17, including
  with respect to the designation of national focal points, pursuant to
  paragraph 3 of Article 17 of the Minamata Convention. Article 24 of the
  Convention further includes in the functions of the Secretariat, <em>inter
  alia</em>, to assist Parties in the exchange of information related to the
  implementation of the Convention, and to prepare and make to the Parties
  period reports based on information received pursuant to Article 21.</p>

  <p>Under the Montreal Protocol, the role of the Secretariat is stipulated in
  Article 12 of the Protocol including the obligation to receive, data provided
  pursuant to Article 7. Additionally, under Article 4B, each Party is required,
  within three months of the date of introducing its licensing system, to report
  to the Secretariat on the establishment and operation of that system. </p>

  <p>Compliance of the Parties with their reporting obligations is considered by
  an Implementation Committee established under the Protocol&#x2019;s
  Non-Compliance Procedure and is determined by the Meeting of the Parties based
  on the Committee&#x2019;s recommendations (<a
  href="https://ozone.unep.org/list-of-implementation-committee-recommendations">https://ozone.unep.org/list-of-implementation-committee-recommendations</a>).
  </p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup class="footnote-number"
  id="footnote-3">2</sup><p> The import response may consist of an interim
  response that is not necessarily a decision see for example Article
  10(4)(b)(ii)-(iv) <a href="#footnote-ref-3">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>
OTHER_METHOD: ''
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The proposed indicator is process-oriented, focusing on compliance with the
  obligations that contribute to the overall target of achieving the
  environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their
  life cycle. </p>

  <p>It doesn&#x2019;t measure the quantity of chemicals in media and
  doesn&#x2019;t quantify adverse impacts on human health and the environment.
  The MEAs, however, were developed and adopted to address the most urgent
  challenges for human health and the environment and therefore, through the
  implementation of MEAs progress will be made to reduce release to air, water
  and soil and well as presence of hazardous chemicals in products. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The transmission of information as required by the five Conventions follows
  a different timing. This is the reason why the reporting to this indicator has
  been scheduled for 5-year cycles, which would allow capturing the compliance
  of Parties with the transmission of information of all the Conventions.</p>

  <p>Please also note that the timing for submission of reporting for the
  Minamata Convention has not yet been agreed on. It is not clear whether any
  reporting will be required prior to 2020, nor it is clear how many times
  reporting would be required prior to 2030. Thus, the Minamata Convention is
  included here, but the reporting is subject to further decisions on this.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>In the following methodology, reporting is to take place in 2017 for the
  period 2010-2014, in 2020 for the period 2015-2019, in 2025 for the period
  2020-2024 and in 2030 for the period 2025-2029. Reporting parameters include
  the following: </p>

  <p>The Country Score depends on the amount of information that is sent to the
  Conventions&#x2019; Secretariat, and is calculated as follows (and
  communicated by the Secretariats):</p>

  <p><strong><u>Basel Convention:</u></strong></p>

  <p>The Montreal protocol does not provide any guidance to countries for the
  compilation of the data at the national level. However, the parties adopted
  data reporting forms to guide the parties on the information to be reported to
  the Secretariat. Additionally, under the institutions of the protocol,
  developing countries get technical and financial assistance, part of which
  includes training manuals and other resources and guidance on compilation
  reporting of data - <a

QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>The BRS Secretariat reviews the national reports for completeness and
  correctness and communicates with Parties with a view of addressing identified
  gaps, when possible.</p>

  <p>Under the Committee administering the Mechanism for Promoting
  Implementation and Compliance (ICC), which is a subsidiary body of the Basel
  Convention, there is a standing area of work on the national reporting which
  aims at improving timely and complete national reporting under paragraph 3 of
  Article 13 of the Convention. Activities in the biennium 2020-2021 include,
  inter alia, classifying and, as appropriate, publishing information on
  Parties&#x2019; compliance with their annual national reporting obligations
  for 2016 and 2017 based on the assumptions, criteria and categories adopted by
  the Conference of the Parties at its thirteenth meeting and the targets
  adopted by the Conference of the Parties at its fourteenth meeting; developing
  recommendations on the revision of targets referred to in paragraph 13 of
  decision BC-14/15 for the reports due for 2018 and subsequent years; and with
  a view to increasing the completeness and timeliness of national reporting
  under paragraph 3 of Article 13, exploring how individual Parties can
  integrate national reporting needs under the Basel Convention into the United
  Nations Development Assistance Framework.</p>

  <p>The Minamata Secretariat has a system in place to (i) review the
  completeness and correctness of the reports received; and (ii) to inform
  Parties about the outcomes of such review before the reports are published on
  the Minamata Convention website.</p>

  <p>The Secretariat for the Montreal Protocol uses an online reporting system
  with a database for collecting and managing the reported information. The
  system includes a variety of checks and validation rules to ensure
  completeness and consistency of the reported information.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>For the Basel and Stockholm Conventions the Electronic Reporting System is
  the tool to be used by Parties to submit their national reports. </p>

  <p>For guidelines please see the responses for the question 4(h).</p>

  <p>A reporting format for the Minamata Convention on Mercury has been adopted
  by the first Conference of the Parties for the submission of national reports
  pursuant to Article 21. The Secretariat drafted guidance for the short reports
  (4 questions) to assist Parties. At its second meeting, the Conference of the
  Parties requested the Secretariat to draft guidance on how to fill out the
  full reporting format (48 questions), which is under preparation. An online
  reporting tool has been prepared by the Secretariat to assist Parties and
  facilitate collecting the information for the reports.</p>

  <p>Under the Montreal Protocol, the responsibility for quality assurance of
  the submitted data and information lies with the parties. </p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>For the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions, information transmitted
  by Parties to the Secretariat is made available to the Conference of the
  Parties for monitoring. </p>

  <p>For the Minamata Convention, the Secretariat can report very high reporting
  rates: 80% of Parties have submitted complete reports (data is available at <a
  href="https://www.mercuryconvention.org/Countries/Parties/Reporting/tabid/8189/language/en-US/Default.aspx">https://www.mercuryconvention.org/Countries/Parties/Reporting/tabid/8189/language/en-US/Default.aspx</a>)
  The Secretariat can also report that 80% of Parties have designated national
  focal points in a timely and appropriate manner (a list of designations is
  available at
  https://www.mercuryconvention.org/Countries/Parties/Notifications/tabid/3826/language/en-US/Default.aspx)</p>

  <p>Under the Montreal Protocol, the responsibility for the overall evaluation
  of fulfilling quality of the submitted data lies with the parties. </p>
