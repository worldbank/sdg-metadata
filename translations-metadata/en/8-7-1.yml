  <p><strong>Definition: </strong></p>

  <p><strong> </strong></p>

  <p>The number of children engaged in child labour corresponds to the number of
  children reported to be in child labour during the reference period (usually
  the week prior to the survey). The proportion of children in child labour is
  calculated as the number of children in child labour divided by the total
  number of children in the population. For the purposes of this indicator,
  children include all persons aged 5 to 17. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts: </strong></p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Three principal international legal instruments &#x2013; ILO Convention No.
  138 (Minimum Age) (C138), United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child
  (CRC), ILO Convention No. 182 (Worst Forms) (C182) together set the legal
  boundaries for child labour, and provide the legal basis for national and
  international actions against it. In accordance with these instruments, child
  labour is work that children should <em>not </em>be doing because (a) they are
  too young or (b) is likely to harm their health, safety or morals, due to its
  nature or the conditions in which it is carried out. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>The resolutions adopted by the International Conference of Labour
  Statisticians (ICLS), the world&#x2019;s acknowledged standard-setting body in
  the area of labour statistics, provide the basis for translating the legal
  standards governing the concept of child labour into statistical terms for the
  purpose of child labour measurement. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>In accordance with the ICLS resolutions<sup>1</sup>, child labour can be
  measured on the basis of the production boundary set by the United Nations
  System of National Accounts (SNA) or on the basis of the general production
  boundary. The former limits the frame of reference to economic activity, while
  the latter extends it to include both economic activity <em>and</em> unpaid
  household services, that is, the production of domestic and personal services
  by a household member for consumption within their own household, commonly
  called &#x201C;household chores&#x201D;. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Following from this, two indicators are used for measuring child labour for
  the purpose of SDG reporting, the first based on the production boundary set
  by the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA) and the second based
  on the general production boundary. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Indicator 1: Proportion and number of children aged 5-17 years engaged in
  economic activities at or above age-specific hourly thresholds (<strong>SNA
  production boundary basis</strong>) </p>

  <p><em>Child labour for the 5 to 11 age range</em>: children working at least
  1 hour per week in economic activity; </p>

  <p><em>Child labour for the 12 to 14 age range</em>: children working for at
  least 14 hours per week in economic activity; </p>

  <p><em>Child labour for the 15 to 17 age range</em>: children working for more
  than 43 hours per week in economic activity. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Indicator 2: Proportion and number of children aged 5-17 years engaged in
  economic activities and household chores at or above age-specific hourly
  thresholds (<strong>general production boundary basis</strong>): </p>

  <p><em>Child labour for the 5 to 11 age range</em>: children working at least
  1 hour per week in economic activity and/or involved in unpaid household
  services for more than 21 hours per week; </p>

  <p><em>Child labour for the 12 to 14 age range</em>: children working for at
  least 14 hours per week in economic activity and/or involved in unpaid
  household services for more than 21 hours per week; </p>

  <p><em>Child labour for the 15 to 17 age range</em>: children working for more
  than 43 hours per week in economic activity.<sup>2</sup> </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>The concept of child labour also includes the worst forms of child labour
  other than hazardous (18<sup>th</sup> ICLS paragraphs 33 to 34) as well as
  hazardous work (18<sup>th</sup> ICLS paragraphs 21 to 32). The worst forms of
  child labour include all forms of slavery or similar practices such as
  trafficking and the recruitment and use of child soldiers, the use or
  procurement of children for prostitution or other illicit activities, and
  other work that is likely to harm children&#x2019;s health, safety or
  well-being. </p>

SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Household surveys such as National Labour Force Surveys, National
  Multipurpose Household Surveys, UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster
  Surveys (MICS), Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), ILO-supported
  Statistical Information and Monitoring Programme on Child Labour (SIMPOC), and
  World Bank Living Standard Measurement surveys (LSMS) are among the most
  important instruments for generating information on child labour in developing
  countries. Estimates of child labour generated by these survey instruments are
  increasingly relied on by countries to monitor progress towards national and
  global child labour elimination targets. Many countries also produce national
  labour estimates and reports that often include data on child labour and/or
  employment among children. </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>UNICEF undertakes a wide consultative process of compiling and assessing
  data from national sources for the purposes of updating its global databases
  on the situation of children. Up until 2017, the mechanism UNICEF used to
  collaborate with national authorities on ensuring data quality and
  international comparability on key indicators of relevance to children was
  known as Country Data Reporting on the Indicators for the Goals (CRING). </p>

  <p>As of 2018, UNICEF launched a new country consultation process with
  national authorities on selected child-related global SDG indicators it is
  custodian or co-custodian to meet emerging standards and guidelines on data
  flows for global reporting of SDG indicators, which place strong emphasis on
  technical rigour, country ownership and use of official data and statistics.
  The consultation process solicited feedback directly from National Statistical
  Offices, as well as other government agencies responsible for official
  statistics, on the compilation of the indicators, including the data sources
  used, and the application of internationally agreed definitions,
  classification and methodologies to the data from that source. The results of
  this country consultation are reviewed and discussed with ILO. Once reviewed,
  feedback is made available to countries on whether or not specific data points
  are accepted, and if not, the reasons why. </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>UNICEF will undertake an annual country consultation likely between
  December and January every year to allow for review and processing of the
  feedback received in order to meet global SDG reporting deadlines. </p>

INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The ILO is the UN focal point for labour statistics. It sets international
  standards for labour statistics through the International Conference of Labour
  Statisticians. It also compiles and produces labour statistics with the goal
  of disseminating internationally comparable datasets, and provides technical
  assistance and training to ILO member States to support their efforts to
  produce high quality labour market data, including child labour data.</p>

  <p>UNICEF provides technical and financial assistance to Member States to
  support their efforts to collect high quality data on child labour, including
  through UNICEF-supported MICS household survey programme. UNICEF also compiles
  child labour statistics with the goal of making internationally comparable
  datasets publicly available, and it analyzes child labour statistics, which
  are included in relevant data-driven publications, including in its flagship
  publication, <em>The State of the World&#x2019;s Children</em>. </p>
OTHER_METHOD: ''
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Far too many children in the world remain trapped in child labour,
  compromising their individual future and our collective futures. According to
  the latest ILO global estimates, about 152 million children worldwide &#x2013;
  64 million girls and 88 million boys - are child labourers, accounting for
  almost 10 percent of the child population. These stark figures underscore the
  need for accelerated progress against child labour in the lead up to the 2025
  target date for ending child labour in all its forms, and the accompanying
  need for child labour statistics to monitor and guide efforts in this regard.
  Reliable, comprehensive and timely data on the nature and extent of child
  labour provide a basis for determining priorities for national global action
  against child labour. Statistical information on child labour, and more
  broadly on all working children, also provide a basis for increasing public
  awareness of the situation of working children and for the development of
  appropriate regulatory frameworks and policies. </p>

  <p> </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p><strong>Comments and limitations: </strong></p>

  <p>While the concept of child labour includes working in activities that are
  hazardous in nature, to ensure comparability of estimates over time and to
  minimize data quality issues, work beyond age-specific hourly thresholds are
  used as a proxy for hazardous work for the purpose of reporting on SDG
  indicator 8.7.1. Further methodological work is needed to validate questions
  specifically aimed at identifying children in hazardous working conditions.
  </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Similarly, while the worst forms of child labour other than hazardous also
  form part of the concept of child labour more broadly, data on the worst forms
  of child labour are not currently captured in regular household surveys given
  difficulties with accurately and reliably measuring it. Therefore, this
  element of child labour is not captured by the indicators used for reporting
  on SDG 8.7.1. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>In addition, &#x2018;own use production of goods&#x2019;, including
  activities such as fetching water and collecting firewood, falls within the
  production boundary set by the United Nations System of National Accounts
  (SNA). However, for the purpose of SDG reporting of indicator 8.7.1, and with
  the goal of facilitating international comparability, fetching water and
  collecting firewood have been classified as unpaid household services (i.e.,
  household chores), a form of production that lies outside the SNA production
  boundary. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>More broadly, child labour estimates based on the statistical standards set
  out in the ICLS resolution represent useful benchmarks for international
  comparative purposes but are <u>not</u> necessarily consistent with estimates
  based on national child labour legislation. ILO Convention No. 138 contains a
  number of flexibility clauses left to the discretion of the competent national
  authority in consultation (where relevant) with workers&#x2019; and
  employers&#x2019; organizations (e.g., minimum ages, scope of
  application).<sup>3</sup> This means that there is no single legal definition
  of child labour across countries, and thus, no single statistical measure of
  child labour consistent with national legislation across countries. </p>

QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>UNICEF and ILO maintain the global database on child labour that is used
  for official SDG reporting. Before the inclusion of any data point in the
  database, it is reviewed by technical focal points at UNICEF and ILO to check
  for consistency and overall data quality. This review is based on a set of
  objective criteria to ensure that only the most recent and reliable
  information are included in the databases. These criteria include the
  following: data sources must include proper documentation; data values must be
  representative at the national population level; data are collected using an
  appropriate methodology (e.g., sampling); data values are based on a
  sufficiently large sample; data conform to the standard indicator definition
  including age group and concepts, to the extent possible; data are plausible
  based on trends and consistency with previously published/reported estimates
  for the indicator. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>As of 2018, UNICEF undertakes an annual consultation with government
  authorities on 10 of the child-related SDG indicators in its role of sole or
  joint custodian, and in line with its global monitoring mandate and normative
  commitments to advancing the 2030 Agenda for children. This includes indicator
  8.7.1. More details on the process for the country consultation are outlined
