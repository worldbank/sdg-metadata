For instance, AF methodology and AROPE are fundamentally very different, and although both produce some headcount ratio of people who are considered as &quot;multidimensionally poor&quot;, their definition of multidimensionality of poverty is utterly different, and so should not be compared. Also, even when they use the same approach, such as, AF, AROPE or MODA, the numbers are not comparable across countries, as the important parameters to calculate the figures such as the number of indicators, the weight allocated to each indicator, how to divide the age group of children are tailored to the country specific context. Furthermore, even in the same country, if the methodology is different, the number should not be compared. For instance, some countries calculate child multidimensional poverty headcount by using both AF and MODA methodologies, but their numbers could be very different as the dimensions and indicators used in both approaches differ significantly. To overcome these comparability issues, UNDP produces global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), which is the product of multiplying multidimensional headcount and average number of deprivations using the same dimensions and indicators covering more than 100 countries. However, most of these numbers are not officially approved by each country, and sometimes the nationally calculated MPI is different from the global MPI due to some difference of the parameters, therefore, in this platform, the global MPI is not included in the Global SDG Database. </p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
