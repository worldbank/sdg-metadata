&lt;p&gt;EU countries and some Latin American countries such as Costa Rica and Ecuador conduct the survey and produce multidimensional indicators every year, but most of the developing countries, especially African countries have published multidimensional measurement only once in the last 10 years, or spasmodically when the funding was available. Therefore, for these countries, it is difficult to state definitely when the next data is available.&lt;/p&gt;
