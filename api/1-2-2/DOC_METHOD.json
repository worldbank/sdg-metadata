Such a measure generates credible and relevant information, and it is established as an official permanent statistic alongside traditional ones such as the income or expenditure poverty headcount and poverty gaps. As with other indicators, it is important that a clear and transparent system be in place for the regular updating of the measurement. This implies that the responsibility for these updates is assigned to an official entity and that associated costs are incorporated in the government&#x2019;s budget. Ideally, a multidimensional poverty measure could be used actively to guide policy-making (e.g. policies coordination, targeting, and policy evaluation). </p>\n<p>To make such a measure institutional and useful, it is fundamental for the government to own the process. Having the support of high-level representatives within the government, such as the president or prime minister, or ministers, grants additional legitimacy to the process and may facilitate the adoption of the measure by other levels of government and stakeholders. In addition, a high-level official may be able to bring other relevant actors into the design process and work on the institutionalization of the measure. The active participation of different ministries in the discussions and decisions throughout the process of design, namely the selection of indicators, respective cut-offs, and weights, is essential to ensure that the final measure meets the needs of policy makers in a specific country context.</p>\n<p>To make a measure long-lasting, rather than specific to a particular administration, it is useful to build consensus and a shared sense of legitimacy around the measure that transcends individual political actors. This requires that the process of developing the measure is perceived as credible, transparent, and non-partisan. Engaging key stakeholders, such as academics, opinion leaders, the opposition, and civil society representatives throughout the process is highly desirable. This should include wide consultations with the public, for example through nationally representative surveys to capture the national consensus about the minima required to satisfy different dimensions. In addition, it is important to have a well-designed communication strategy to explain the concept and the process to these different actors, allowing for channels for them to participate in the discussions about the design of the measure. Some countries have opted for involving a poverty committee that gathers experts and representatives from different sectors of society in the decision process of designing the measure. </p>\n<p>More specifically, the design of a measure of multidimensional poverty generally involves a technical process, complemented and supported by a political process. If both technical and political committees are set up, it is useful to agree on: (1) a plan of activities and timeline; (2) a schedule of regular interactions to ensure good communication; and (3) a documentation system that keeps track of all decisions and respective rationales. However, political interference in the technical process should be avoided, as recommended by the UNSD National Quality Assurance Frameworks Manual for Official Statistics.</p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
