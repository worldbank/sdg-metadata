{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 1-2-2, translated into en","data":"<p>The compiled data of SDG 1.2.2 is not intended to be comparable across countries due to the methodological differences. For instance, although both AF methodology and AROPE produce the headcount ratio of people who are considered as &quot;multidimensionally poor&quot;, their definition of multidimensionality is different and cannot be compared. Also, even when countries use the same approach (e.g. AF, AROPE or MODA), the statistics are not always comparable, as key parameters to calculate the measure such as the number of indicators, the weight allocated to each indicator etc, are tailored to the country specific context. Furthermore, even in the same country, if the methodology is different, the number should not be compared. For instance, if a country calculates its official multidimensional poverty using the AF measure but the child multidimensional poverty using the MODA methodology, the measures could be very different as the dimensions and indicators used in both approaches differ significantly. In this SDG 1.2.2 monitoring, the child multidimensional poverty based on the MODA methodology is reported as a supplementary indicator and the multidimensional poverty rate is reported separately from the disaggregation of the official multidimensional poverty indicator for children. </p>"}
