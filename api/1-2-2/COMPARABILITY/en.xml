	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 1-2-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it was mentioned in section 4, the compiled data of SDG 1.2.2 are not intended to be comparable across countries due to national definitions. It is quite common that countries use a different number of dimensions and a variety of indicators depending on the country context. As SDG 1.2.2 explicitly says multidimensional poverty should be estimated in each country according to national definitions, this lack of comparability is not an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given there is no custodian agency to estimate internationally comparable levels of multidimensional poverty, there are no, &lt;em&gt;stricto sensu&lt;/em&gt;, challenges in terms of discrepancies. Nevertheless, sometimes agencies do calculate multidimensional poverty, using common and comparable dimensions, indicators, and thresholds for different types of reports or analyses. In these cases, it has to be remembered that these are not official (i.e. government sanctioned and approved) estimates. Most importantly, they should not be used to replace nationally owned estimates.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
