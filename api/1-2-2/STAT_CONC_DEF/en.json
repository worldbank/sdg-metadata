The unit of analysis could be either the individual or the household. The individuals or households are considered as multidimensionally poor if they are deprived in multiple dimensions, exceeding certain thresholds. </p>\n<p>EU Member States, Island, Norway, Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Turkey have a different approach to measure the multidimensional poverty using the concept of &quot;people at risk of poverty or social exclusion&quot; (AROPE) calculated by EUROSTAT using the data from EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC). AROPE consists of three components, and individuals are considered as &quot;at risk of poverty or social exclusion&quot; if they are &quot;at risk of poverty&quot; or &quot;severely materially and socially deprived&quot; or &quot;living in a household with a very low work intensity&quot;. <sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[1]</a></sup></p>\n<p>There is a multidimensional poverty measure specifically designed for children. A child is considered multidimensionally poor if s/he is simultaneously deprived in multiple dimensions. It identifies the dimensions of poverty and the indicators under each dimension, and has a similar structure to the AF methodology. However, it is different in that it focuses on the life-cycle of children, creating different sets of dimensions and indicators for different age groups (e.g., for ages 0-4, 5-11, 12-14, 15-17 years), and conducts analyses separately for each age group. In the global SDG database, the multidimensional poverty headcount (%) for the overall 0-17 age group has been used for countries reporting individual measures of child multidimensional poverty.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">1</sup><p> For more information please see Eurostat&#x2019;s definitions <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=EU_statistics_on_income_and_living_conditions_(EU-SILC)_methodology_-_people_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion\">https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=EU_statistics_on_income_and_living_conditions_(EU-SILC)_methodology_-_people_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion</a>. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-2\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>"}
