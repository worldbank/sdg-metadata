	<message>The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 1-2-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The data has been validated by a three-stage approach to assure its accuracy. First, the data is entered by World Bank staff assigned to each country, typically in consultation with the country NSO and/or country official documents. That data is sent to UNICEF and UNDP country officers for the validation. After integrating inputs from these three agencies, the data is sent to the SDGs focal point for each country for their final approval. For countries where the World Bank does not have any country offices, such as for OECD and EU countries, the World Bank collected the information based on data source available online, and sent it directly to the official counterparts of each country for verification.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
