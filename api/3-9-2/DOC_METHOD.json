Rather, they are modelled using Comparative Risk Assessment methods<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[1]</a></sup> (For further information please see section 4.c.). However, while countries do not routinely collect these data to feed into the global figures for indicator 3.9.2, there have been a small number of requests for technical assistance from WHO country offices for support in the country-level calculation of WASH-attributable disease burden. A country tool is in development to enable countries to calculate the estimated burden of disease associated with WASH for their own country, and this will be available later this year. </p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">1</sup><p> Pr&#xFC;ss-Ust&#xFC;n A, Wolf J, Bartram J, Clasen T, Cumming O, Freeman MC, Gordon B, Hunter PR, Medlicott K, Johnston R.
