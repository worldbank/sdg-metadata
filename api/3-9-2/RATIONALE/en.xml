	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 3-9-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The indicator expresses the number of deaths from inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene (with focus on WASH services) which could be prevented by improving those services and practices. It is based on both the WASH service provision in the country, as well as the related health outcomes, and therefore provides important information on the actual disease caused by the risks measured in targets 6.1 and 6.2. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
