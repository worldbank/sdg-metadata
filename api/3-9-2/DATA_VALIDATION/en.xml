	<data>&lt;p&gt;Draft estimates are reviewed with Member States through a WHO country consultation process and SDG focal points every time new data are generated. In addition, the methods and data are published in a peer-reviewed journal. 2016 estimates were published in 2019 (see 4.c.), and the manuscript for the 2019 estimates presently being submitted is currently under development, with plans for submission to a peer-reviewed journal by April 2022. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
