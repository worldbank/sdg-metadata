	<message>The STAT_CONC_DEF field for indicator 11-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator measures the ratio of direct economic loss attributed to disasters in relation to GDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concepts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic Loss: Total economic impact that consists of direct economic loss and indirect economic loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct economic loss: the monetary value of total or partial destruction of physical assets existing in the affected area. Direct economic loss is nearly equivalent to physical damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indirect economic loss: a decline in economic value added as a consequence of direct economic loss and/or human and environmental impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Annotations: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Examples of physical assets that are the basis for calculating direct economic loss include homes, schools, hospitals, commercial and governmental buildings, transport, energy, telecommunications infrastructures and other infrastructure; business assets and industrial plants; production such as crops, livestock and production infrastructure. They may also encompass environmental assets and cultural heritage. Direct economic losses usually happen during the event or within the first few hours after the event and are often assessed soon after the event to estimate recovery cost and claim insurance payments. These are tangible and relatively easy to measure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</data>
