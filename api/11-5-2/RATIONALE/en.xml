	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 11-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 was adopted by UN Member States in March 2015 as a global policy of disaster risk reduction. Among the global targets, &amp;#x201C;Target C: Reduce direct disaster economic loss in relation to global gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030&amp;#x201D; will contribute to sustainable development and strengthen economic, social, health and environmental resilience. The economic, environmental and social perspectives would include poverty eradication, urban resilience, and climate change adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to disaster risk reduction (OIEWG) established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) has developed a set of indicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework, which was endorsed by the UNGA (OIEWG &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.preventionweb.net/publications/view/51748&quot;&gt;report A/71/644&lt;/a&gt;). The relevant global indicators for the Sendai Framework will be used to report for this indicator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disaster loss data is greatly influenced by large-scale catastrophic events, which represent important outliers. UNISDR recommends countries report the data by event, so that complementary analysis can be undertaken to obtain trends and patterns in which such catastrophic events (that can represent outliers in terms of damage) can be included or excluded.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
