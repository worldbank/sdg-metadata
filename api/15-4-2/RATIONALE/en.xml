	<data>&lt;p&gt;Mountain ecosystems are important biodiversity centres that provide valuable ecosystem services to upstream and downstream areas. Yet, mountains are very fragile and impacted easily by both natural and anthropogenic factors. These can include climate change, unplanned agricultural expansion, unplanned urbanization, timber extraction, recreational activities and natural hazards such as landslides and flooding. The degradation of mountain ecosystems such as loss of the glacial cover, mountain biodiversity and green cover will affect the ability of the ecosystem to supply water downstream. The loss of forest and vegetative cover will reduce the ability of the ecosystem to retain soil and prevent landslides and flooding downstream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, monitoring mountain vegetation changes and its estimated impact in terms of ecosystem degradation and recovery provides information on the status of mountain ecosystems. Assessing the changes in land cover differentiated by bioclimatic belts is important in understanding the role that environmental factors, such as climate, play in explaining variations of mountain green cover across regions and helps to better interpret the direction of those changes. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
