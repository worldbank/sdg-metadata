However, in certain cases, such data may not be available. In those cases, various regional or global products provide a viable alternative.</p>\n<p>The global default source of land cover data for this indicator is the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) Land Cover product (ESA, 2017). The ESA-CCI product consists of a series of annual Land Cover maps at 300 m resolution, providing 22 land cover classes based on 300m MERIS, 1km SPOT &#x2013;VEGETATION, 1km PROBA &#x2013;V and 1km AVHRR. The ESA CCI adheres to the FAO Land Cover Classification System (Santoro <em>et al</em>. 2015). Annual updates are currently available from 1992 to 2020. Additional years will be made available by the European Space Agency. </p>\n<p>A global mountain area map sub-divided by bioclimatic belts has been developed by FAO and made available to national authorities to facilitate the compute this indicator. This map is the result of combining a global mountain area map developed from the Global Multi-Resolution Terrain Elevation Data (GMTED2010), following the UNEP-WCMC methodology (Ravilious <em>et al. </em>2021) and a mountain bioclimatic belt map created by the Global Mountain Biodiversity Assessment<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[2]</a></sup>. </p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-3\">2</sup><p> https://ilias.unibe.ch/goto.php?target=file_2171234 <a href=\"#footnote-ref-3\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>"}
