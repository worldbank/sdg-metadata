{"status":"success","message":"The STAT_CONC_DEF field for indicator 15-4-2, translated into en","data":"<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>\n<p>The Mountain Green Cover Index (MGCI) is designed to measure the extent and the changes of green vegetation in mountain areas - i.e. forest, shrubs, trees, pasture land, cropland, etc. &#x2013; in order to monitor progress towards the mountain target. MGCI is defined as the percentage of green cover over the total surface of the mountain region of a given country and for given reporting year. The aim of the index is to monitor the evolution of the green cover and thus assess the status of conservation of mountain ecosystems.</p>\n<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>\n<p>The Mountain Green Cover index is based on two descriptor layers of information:</p>\n<p>1. <u>A mountain descriptor layer</u>: mountains can be defined with reference to a variety of parameters, such as climate, elevation, ecology (K&#xF6;rner <em>et al.</em>, 2011) (Karagulle <em>et al</em>., 2017). This methodology adheres to the UNEP- WCMC mountain definition, relying in turn on the mountain description proposed by Kapos <em>et al.</em> (2000).</p>\n<p>This description classifies mountains according altitude, slope and elevation range into 6 categories.</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Mountain Class </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Description </p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>1</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Elevation &gt; 4.500 meters</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>2</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Elevation 3.500&#x2013;4.500 meters</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>3</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Elevation 2.500&#x2013;3.500 meters</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>4</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Elevation 1.500&#x2013;2.500 meters and slope &gt; 2</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>5</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Elevation 1.000&#x2013;1.500 meters and slope &gt; 5 or local elevation range (LER 7 kilometer radius) &gt; 300 meters</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>6</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Elevation 300&#x2013;1.000 meters and local elevation range (7 kilometer radius) &gt; 300 meters</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>2. <u>A vegetation descriptor layer</u>: The vegetation descriptor layer categorizes land cover into green and non-green areas. Green vegetation includes both natural vegetation and vegetation resulting from anthropic activity (e.g. crops, afforestation, etc.). Non-green areas include very sparsely vegetated areas, bare land, water, permanent ice/snow and urban areas. The vegetation description layer can be derived in different ways, but remote sensing based land cover maps are the most convenient data source for this purpose, as they provide the required information on green and non-green areas in a spatially explicit manner and allow for comparison over time through land cover change analysis. </p>\n<p>Currently, FAO uses land cover time series produced by the European Space Agency (ESA) under the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) as a general solution. The original CCI classes are re-classified into six IPCC classes and further into binary green/non-green cover classes as follows:</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>ESA CCI class</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>IPCC class</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Green / Non green</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>50, 60, 61, 62, 70, 71, 72, 80, 81, 82, 90, 100</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Forest<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[1]</a></sup></sup></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Green</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>110, 120, 121, 122, 130, 140, </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Grassland</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Green</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>10,11, 12, 20, 30, 40</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Cropland</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Green</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>160, 170, 180</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Wetland</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Green</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>190</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Settlement</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Non Green</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>150, 151, 152, 153, 200, 201, 202, 210, 220</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Other land</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Non Green</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">1</sup><p> Please note, that here the term &#x201C;Forest&#x201D; refers to land cover, not necessarily land use. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-2\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>"}
