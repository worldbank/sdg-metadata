MGCI is defined as the percentage of green cover over the total surface of the mountain area of a given country and for given reporting year. The aim of the index is to monitor the evolution of green cover and thus assess the status of conservation of mountain ecosystems.</p>\n<p>Sub-indicator 15.4.2b, Proportion of degraded mountain land, is designed to monitor the extent of degraded mountain land as a result of land cover change in a given country and for given reporting year. Similarly to sub-indicator &#x2018;&#x2019;trends in land cover&#x201D; under SDG Indicator 15.3.1 (Sims <em>et al.</em> 2021), mountain ecosystem degradation and recovery is assessed based on the definition of land cover type transitions that indicate improving, stable or degrading conservation status. The definition of degradation adopted for the computation of this indicator is the one established Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[1]</a></sup>.</p>\n<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Mountain area</em> </strong>is defined according to the UNEP-WCMC (2002) method.

This is no longer the case, with Kapos mountain classes having been replaced by a bioclimatic belts (see section 2.c below).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Land cover </em></strong>refers to the observed physical cover of the Earth&#x2019;s surface. It includes vegetation and man-made features as well as bare rock, bare soil and inland water surfaces (FAO-GTOS, 2009). The primary units for characterizing land cover are categories (e.g. Forest or Open Water). These categories must be defined following a standardized land cover classification in order to identify land cover changes consistently over time. Several global standards of land cover classifications have been developed by international initiatives for this purpose. </p>\n<p>For the purposes of standardization and harmonization when reporting on SDG Indicator 15.4.2, this indicator has adapted the land cover classification established by the United Nations Statistical Commission&#x2019;s System of Environmental and Economic Accounting (UN-SEEA) (UN Statistical Division, 2014) by selecting the most relevant SEEA classes for mountain ecosystems and aggregating all croplands classes (Table 2).</p>\n<p><strong>Table 2.</strong> Left: Land cover classification established by the UN-SEEA (Source: UN Statistical Division, 2014).
