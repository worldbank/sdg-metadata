	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 15-4-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data on both sub-indicators will be provided by National Statistics Office (NSO) SDG focal points to the FAO following a standard format every three years. This will include the original data and reference sources, and descriptions of how these have been used to derive sub-indicators values. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, global estimates of both sub-indicators for all countries and territories having mountain areas will be computed by FAO using the above-mentioned global default data sources when national official data do not exist or are incomplete. In such cases, FAO shares country figures with NSO SDG focal points for their validation before publication, in accordance to the IAEG-SDG guidelines of Global Data Flows and Reporting. &lt;/p&gt;
