	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 15-4-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is generated by geospatial data and therefore has universal coverage. Countries with no values on the global SDG database are either A) countries with no mountains where the indicator is not applicable (indicated as NA) or B) countries that have not validated FAO&amp;#x2019;s estimates and yet have not provided figures of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Country, regional and global figures are available since the year 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sub-indicator 15.4.2a, data is available for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2018, and subsequently every three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sub-indicator 15.4.2b, data is available for the reporting period 2000-2015 (baseline), 2018, and subsequently every three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the global SDG database, both sub-indicators are disaggregated by mountain bioclimatic belts as defined by K&amp;#xF6;rner &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;(2011) (see section 2c. Classifications). In addition, sub-indicator 15.4.2a is disaggregated by the 10 SEEA classes included in Table 2. Those values are reported both as proportions (percent) and area (in square kilometres). &lt;/p&gt;</data>
