	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 15-4-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global default source of land cover data for this indicator, the ESA CCI Land Cover product, has been reported to have an overall accuracy of 73.2%. However, the accuracy estimate was calculated using the original 22 land cover classes. As the methodology presented here is based on use of aggregate classes, the accuracy can be expected to be higher for sub-indicator 15.4.2a non-disaggregated data. The accuracy of the global land cover products can vary regionally and by land cover type. For the same reason, the presented indicator values may differ from those derived using national land cover maps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reporting format will help to ensure that countries provide references for national data sources used, associated definitions and terminology as well as more detailed analysis of the data based on more detailed land cover classifications. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
