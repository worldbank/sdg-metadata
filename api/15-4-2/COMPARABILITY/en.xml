	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default methodology presented here is based on the use of the global ESA CCI Land Cover product, which has been reported to have an overall accuracy of 73.2%. However, the accuracy estimate was calculated using the original 22 land cover classes. As the methodology presented here is based on use of aggregate classes, the accuracy can be expected to be higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accuracy of the global land cover products can vary regionally. For the same reason, the presented indicator values may differ from those derived using national land cover maps. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
