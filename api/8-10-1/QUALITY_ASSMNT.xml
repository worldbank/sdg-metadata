			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The Financial Access Survey (FAS) is a supply-side database with data reported from central banks and other financial regulators sourced from administrative data. Supply-side data tend to be more accurate than demand-side surveys. Furthermore, any deviations from the FAS methodology or fluctuations are reported by the country in the metadata, which is available on the FAS data portal. &lt;/p&gt;
