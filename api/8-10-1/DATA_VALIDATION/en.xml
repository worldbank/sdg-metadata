	<message>The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 8-10-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The Financial Access Survey (FAS) questionnaire has built-in consistency checks to help data reporters spot inconsistencies in data reporting. Once the data is reported to the FAS, it undergoes a round of automated validation checks. If any inconsistency is detected, the FAS Team engages with the country authorities for clarifications or adjustments to the data provided. In case a country needs to add additional relevant information pertinent to the data reported, they can do so through the metadata portal in Integrated Collection System (ICS). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, submissions are disseminated on the FAS website (&lt;a href=&quot;https://data.imf.org/?sk=E5DCAB7E-A5CA-4892-A6EA-598B5463A34C&quot;&gt;data.imf.org/fas&lt;/a&gt;) on a rolling basis as soon as they are reviewed and validated. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
