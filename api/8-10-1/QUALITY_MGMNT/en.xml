	<data>&lt;p&gt;The Financial Access Survey (FAS) questionnaire has built-in consistency checks to help data reporters spot inconsistencies in data reporting. Once the data is reported to the FAS, it undergoes a round of automated validation checks and careful review by the FAS team. The analytical work on the reported data also aids spotting and correcting inconsistencies in the data, if any.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
