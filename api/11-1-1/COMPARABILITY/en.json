{"status":"success","message":"The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 11-1-1, translated into en","data":"<p>As national agencies are responsible for data collection, no differences between country produced data and international estimated data on the indicator are expected to arise if standard methodologies and procedures are followed at all stages of the reporting process. Where such discrepancies exist, these will be resolved through planned technical meetings and capacity development workshops.</p>\n<p>Missing data and other local variables and frequency of data collection usually affects the figures reported at the global and national level. For this indicator, national data will be used to derive global figures. In instances where global values differ from national figures, efforts will be made for harmonization. There are many instances where lack of new data will be replaced with modelled data for the global figures. These figures will be acceptable for reporting at the national and global levels with the relevant notes attached to such figures. This is likely to be the case for countries where they have long intervals of collection of new data, or where countries face unstable situations such post-disaster or post-war years.</p>"}
