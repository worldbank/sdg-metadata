	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 11-1-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The computation of this indicator is mainly based on analysis of existing data sources including population and housing censuses and household surveys that contain information on all five components of slum: improved water, improved sanitation, durable housing, sufficient living area and secure tenure. Nationally representative household surveys, which typically collect information on water, sanitation and housing conditions, include Urban Inequities Surveys (UIS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Demographic Health Surveys (DHS), World Health Surveys (WHS), Living Standards and Measurement Surveys (LSMS), Core Welfare Indicator Questionnaires (CWIQ), and other relevant surveys. National-level household surveys are generally conducted every 3-5 years in most developing countries, while censuses are generally conducted every 10 years. At the Global level, data will be assembled and compiled for international use and comparison by UN-Habitat and other partners. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
