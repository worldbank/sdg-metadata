	<message>The DATA_SOURCE field for indicator 11-1-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;This indicator has largely been successfully due to the collaborations between several organizations and institutions including UN- Habitat, UNEP, Cities Alliance, Slum dwellers International, and World Bank. There are several other experts who have also contributed to the development of the concepts, rationale and definitions, and metadata and will also support measurement, reporting and policy dialogue at the country level, based on the indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Statistical Offices will play an important role in the monitoring and reporting process through census and surveys. Final Compilation &amp;amp; reporting at the global level will be lead and guided by UN-Habitat with support from selected partners. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
