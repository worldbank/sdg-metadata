The agency also provides on-the-task training to countries on a need basis, as well as continuous technical support throughout the data compilation process to ensure alignment of national processes with the globally adopted methodology. </p>\n<p>In addition, UN-Habitat has developed audio-visual content for indicator 11.1.1 that is available through its E-Learning Portal, offering more interactive learning for data producers at different levels. The content includes self-paced e-learning courses which present descriptive and practical step-by-step guidance on how to compute each indicator. These courses are aimed at strengthening national capacities in collecting, analyzing, and monitoring the urban SDG indicators. They are also designed to be attractive to different groups, from data producers to people just interested in understanding the indicators and their interpretation. This was intended to broaden the pool of experts on urban monitoring and increase the uptake and use of the tools within countries.</p>"}
