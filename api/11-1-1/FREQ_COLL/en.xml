	<data>&lt;p&gt;All major surveys and census data collection process will continue to incorporate the aspects/components necessary for reporting on this indicator. The monitoring of this indicator will be repeated at regular intervals of 3-5 years, allowing for 3 five-year reporting points until the year 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UN-Habitat has developed simple reporting template to collect data from countries (&lt;a href=&quot;https://data.unhabitat.org/pages/guidance&quot;&gt;https://data.unhabitat.org/pages/guidance&lt;/a&gt;). The template, which is sent to countries on an annual basis is expected to be used until 2030, but slight changes may be effected as data on more aspects becomes available. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
