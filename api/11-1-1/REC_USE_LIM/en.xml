	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 11-1-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;As with all indicators, there are some potential challenges and limitations. Some of these are outlined below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Difficulties to agree universally on some definitions and characteristics when referring to deteriorated housing conditions, often due to political or economic considerations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lack of appropriate tools at national and city levels to measure all components required by Indicator 11.1.1, sometimes resulting in the underestimation of deteriorated housing units.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The complicated relation between security of tenure with land and property makes it a difficult, but vital, aspect to include in the different surveys, and thus, to measure and monitor. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Indicator 11.1.1 does not capture homelessness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many countries still have limited capacities for data collection, management and analysis, their update and monitoring. These are key to ensure national and global data consistency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</data>
