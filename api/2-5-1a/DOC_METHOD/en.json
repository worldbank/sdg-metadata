{"status":"success","message":"The DOC_METHOD field for indicator 2-5-1a, translated into en","data":"<p>Officially appointed National Focal Points and managers of regional or international genebanks are requested to provide the list of accessions conserved in medium or long term conservation facilities by filling a spreadsheet contained in document <em>List of descriptors for reporting on the Plant Component of SDG indicator 2.5.1</em> (see References) accessible from the World Information and Early Warning System for plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (WIEWS) home page (<a href=\"http://www.fao.org/wiews\">http://www.fao.org/wiews</a>). Out of the 13 passport descriptors which can be used to characterize each accession, four are mandatory: (i) the name of the genebank (or <em>holding institute code</em>); (ii) the <em>accession number</em><sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[1]</a></sup>; (iii) the scientific name of the accession (<em>name of taxon</em>, including genus, species and lower taxonomic ranking); and (iv) the type of storage. </p>\n<p>Reporting on the remaining descriptors is highly recommended, as it allows the analysis of changes in different types of diversity concerned, including changes in the type and origin of the material secured (e.g. <em>biological status</em>; <em>country of origin</em>; <em>locations of safety duplications</em>; etc.) and better describes the composition of the secured materials. The descriptors have been agreed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (see question 6.2 in the <em>Reporting format for monitoring the implementation of the Second global Plan of Action for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture</em> <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-mm294e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/3/a-mm294e.pdf</a>). Genebank holdings are counted based on the list of accessions reported. National Focal Points are invited to provide a brief analysis to highlight and explain changes occurred since the previous report.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">1</sup><p> <a href=\"#footnote-ref-2\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>"}
