	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data collected as part of the first monitoring cycle of the implementation of the Second Global Plan of Action for PGRFA serve as baseline (number of accessions as of June 2014). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of February 2020, data on over 5.4 million accessions from 103 countries and 17 international/regional centres are being published. The data collection is carried out annually in January. Continued efforts are made to improve the coverage of countries and international/regional centres, as well as the quality of the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data are available in WIEWS for 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. Estimates of the status of the indicator before 2014 are made using the &lt;em&gt;acquisition date&lt;/em&gt; of the accessions as reported in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geographic disaggregation (national, regional, global) is made. Grouping by sex, age etc. is not applicable.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
