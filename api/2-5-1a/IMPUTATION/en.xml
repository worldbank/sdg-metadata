&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For plants missing values are treated as such and not replaced by estimates. For animals, for a given breed, if no data are provided for a respective year, it is assumed that the storage status remains the same as for the last year for which data have been reported. In this case the nature of data is considered to be estimated. However, if the most recent reporting refers to a year more than 10- years before, the storage status is considered &amp;#x201C;unknown&amp;#x201D;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At regional and global levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For both components, plants and animals, missing values are treated as such and not replaced by estimates.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
