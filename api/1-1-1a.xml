&lt;h2&gt;Organization(s):&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World Bank (WB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Concepts and definitions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definition:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator &amp;#x201C;proportion of the population below the international poverty line&amp;#x201D; is defined as the percentage of the population living on less than $1.90 a day at 2011 international prices. The &amp;apos;international poverty line&amp;apos; is currently set at $1.90 a day at 2011 international prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In assessing poverty in a given country, and how best to reduce poverty, one naturally focuses on a poverty line that is considered appropriate for that country. But how do we talk meaningfully about &amp;#x201C;global poverty?&amp;#x201D; Poverty lines across countries vary in terms of their purchasing power, and they have a strong economic gradient, such that richer countries tend to adopt higher standards of living in defining poverty. But to consistently measure global absolute poverty in terms of consumption we need to treat two people with the same purchasing power over commodities the same way&amp;#x2014;both are either poor or not poor&amp;#x2014;even if they live in different countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since World Development Report 1990, the World Bank has aimed to apply a common standard in measuring extreme poverty, anchored to what poverty means in the world&amp;apos;s poorest countries. The welfare of people living in different countries can be measured on a common scale by adjusting for differences in the purchasing power of currencies. The commonly used $1 a day standard, measured in 1985 international prices and adjusted to local currency using PPPs, was chosen for World Development Report 1990 because it was typical of the poverty lines in low-income countries at the time. As differences in the cost of living across the world evolve, the international poverty line has to be periodically updated using new PPP price data to reflect these changes. The last change was in October 2015, when the World Bank adopted $1.90 as the international poverty line using the 2011 PPP. Prior to that, the 2008 update set the international poverty line at $1.25 using the 2005 PPP. Poverty measures based on international poverty lines attempt to hold the real value of the poverty line constant across countries, as is done when making comparisons over time. Early editions of the World Bank&amp;#x2019;s World Development Indicators (WDI) used PPPs from the Penn World Tables to convert values in local currency to equivalent purchasing power measured in U.S dollars. Later editions used 1993, 2005, and 2011 consumption PPP estimates produced by the World Bank&amp;#x2019;s International Comparison Program (ICP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Data sources&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank typically receives data from National Statistical Offices (NSOs) directly. In other cases it uses NSO data received indirectly. For example, it receives data from Eurostat and from LIS (Luxemburg Income Study), who provide the World Bank NSO data they have received / harmonized. The Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina and the World Bank jointly maintain the SEDLAC (Socio-Economic Database for Latin American and Caribbean) database that includes harmonized statistics on poverty and other distributional and social variables from 24 Latin American and Caribbean countries, based on microdata from household surveys conducted by NSOs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is obtained through country specific programs, including technical assistance programs and joint analytical and capacity building activities. The World Bank has relationships with NSOs on work programs involving statistical systems and data analysis. Poverty economists from the World Bank typically engage with NSOs broadly on poverty measurement and analysis as part of technical assistance activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the World Bank, the Global Poverty Working Group (GPWG) is in charge of the collection, validation and estimation of poverty estimates. GPWG archives the datasets obtained from NSOs and then harmonizes them, applying common methodologies. The objective of the GPWG is to ensure that poverty and inequality data generated, curated, and disseminated by the World Bank are up to date, meet high-quality standards, and are well documented and consistent across dissemination channels. Members of GPWG generate and update the estimates for the proportion of population below the international poverty line using raw data typically provided by country governments. The raw data are obtained by poverty economists through their contacts in the NSOs, and checked for quality before being submitted for further analysis. The raw data can be unit-record survey data, or grouped data, depending on the agreements with the country governments. In most cases, the welfare aggregate, the essential element for poverty estimation, is generated by the country governments. Sometimes, the World Bank has to construct the welfare aggregate or adjust the aggregate provided by the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;List:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directly from National Statistical Offices (NSOs) or indirectly from others &amp;#x2013; see section on data sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Collection process:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank transparently shares and makes public the methodologies for all kinds of adjustments to original data (e.g., through its PovcalNet website and its various analytical documents). The poverty estimates are developed by economists, who work closely with national government counterparts concerning each poverty data update. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Calendar&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data collection:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source collection is ongoing by the Global Poverty Working Group of the World Bank. The calculation of new poverty numbers using updated source data normally takes place from May to September every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Data release:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank Group is committed to updating the poverty data every year. Updated estimates are released at the World Bank&amp;#x2019;s Annual Meetings in October every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Data providers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank typically receives data from National Statistical Offices (NSOs) directly. In other cases it uses NSO data received indirectly. Please see the section on data sources for further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Data compilers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World Bank&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rationale:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monitoring poverty is important on the global development agenda as well as on the national development agenda of many countries. The World Bank produced its first global poverty estimates for developing countries for World Development Report 1990: Poverty (World Bank 1990) using household survey data for 22 countries (Ravallion, Datt, and van de Walle 1991). Since then there has been considerable expansion in the number of countries that field household income and expenditure surveys. The World Bank&amp;apos;s Development Research Group maintains a database that is updated annually as new survey data become available (and thus may contain more recent data or revisions) and conducts a major reassessment of progress against poverty every year. PovcalNet is an interactive computational tool that allows users to replicate these internationally comparable $1.90 and $3.20 a day global, regional and country-level poverty estimates and to compute poverty measures for custom country groupings and for different poverty lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Poverty and Equity Data portal provides access to the database and user-friendly dashboards with graphs and interactive maps that visualize trends in key poverty and inequality indicators for different regions and countries. The country dashboards display trends in poverty measures based on the national poverty lines alongside the internationally comparable estimates, produced from and consistent with PovcalNet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Comments and limitations:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five countries &amp;#x2013; Bangladesh, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Jordan, and Laos &amp;#x2013; use the 2005 PPP conversion factors and corresponding $1.25 a day and $2 a day poverty lines. This is due to the large deviations in the rate of change in PPP factors relative to the rate of change in domestic consumer price indexes. See Box 1.1 in the Global Monitoring Report 2015/2016 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-monitoring-report&quot;&gt;http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-monitoring-report&lt;/a&gt;) for a detailed explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite progress in the last decade, the challenges of measuring poverty remain. The timeliness, frequency, quality, and comparability of household surveys needs to increase substantially, particularly in the poorest countries. The availability and quality of poverty monitoring data remains low in small states, countries with fragile situations, and low-income countries and even some middle-income countries. The low frequency and lack of comparability of the data available in some countries create uncertainty over the magnitude of poverty reduction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the frequency and timeliness of survey data, other data quality issues arise in measuring household living standards. The surveys ask detailed questions on sources of income and how it was spent, which must be carefully recorded by trained personnel. Income is generally more difficult to measure accurately, and consumption comes closer to the notion of living standards. And income can vary over time even if living standards do not. But consumption data are not always available: the latest estimates reported here use consumption data for about two-thirds of countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even similar surveys may not be strictly comparable because of differences in timing or in the quality and training of enumerators. Comparisons of countries at different levels of development also pose a potential problem because of differences in the relative importance of the consumption of nonmarket goods. The local market value of all consumption in kind (including own production, particularly important in underdeveloped rural economies) should be included in total consumption expenditure but may not be. Most survey data now include valuations for consumption or income from own production, but valuation methods vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Methodology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Computation method:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To measure poverty across countries consistently, the World Bank&amp;#x2019;s international measures apply a common standard, anchored to what &amp;#x201C;poverty&amp;#x201D; means in the world&amp;#x2019;s poorest countries. The original &amp;#x201C;$1-a-day&amp;#x201D; line was based on a compilation of national lines for only 22 developing countries, mostly from academic studies in the 1980s (Ravallion, et al., 1991). While this was the best that could be done at the time, the sample was hardly representative of developing countries even in the 1980s. Since then, national poverty lines have been developed for many other countries. Based on a new compilation of national lines for 75 developing countries, Ravallion, Chen and Sangraula (RCS) (2009) proposed a new international poverty line of $1.25 a day. This is the average poverty line for the poorest 15 countries in their data set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current extreme poverty line is set at $1.90 a day in 2011 PPP terms, which represents the mean of the national poverty lines found in the same poorest 15 countries ranked by per capita consumption. The new poverty line maintains the same standard for extreme poverty - the poverty line typical of the poorest countries in the world - but updates it using the latest information on the cost of living in developing countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When measuring international poverty of a country, the international poverty line at PPP is converted to local currencies in 2011 price and is then converted to the prices prevailing at the time of the relevant household survey using the best available Consumer Price Index (CPI). (Equivalently, the survey data on household consumption or income for the survey year are expressed in the prices of the ICP base year, and then converted to PPP $&amp;#x2019;s.) Then the poverty rate is calculated from that survey. All inter-temporal comparisons are real, as assessed using the country-specific CPI. Interpolation/extrapolation methods are used to line up the survey-based estimates with these reference years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Treatment of missing values:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;At country level:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no &amp;#x201C;imputation&amp;#x201D; in the traditional sense for missing country data. However, to generate regional and global aggregates for reference years, country-level data are imputed for the years when surveys are not conducted. These imputed data are to be used for aggregation, but not for replacing the actual survey data. The subsequent section on the treatment of missing values at the regional and global levels provide more details on the imputation method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;At regional and global levels:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compare the poverty rates across countries and compute regional aggregates, country estimates must be &amp;#x201C;lined up&amp;#x201D; first to a common reference year, interpolating for countries in which survey data are not available in the reference year but are available either before, after, or both. The more survey data are available (that is, the more data for different years), the more accurate the interpolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process requires adjusting the mean income or expenditure observed in the survey year by a growth factor to infer the unobserved level in the reference year. Thus, two assumptions are required to implement this process: distribution-neutral growth and a real rate of growth between the survey and reference year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distribution-neutral growth implies that income or expenditure levels are adjusted for growth assuming that the underlying relative distribution of income or expenditure observed in survey years remains unchanged. Under this assumption, it is straightforward to interpolate the poverty estimate in a given reference year implied by a given rate of growth in income or expenditure. Rates of change in real consumption per capita should be based on the change in real consumption measured by comparing country survey data across different years. In practice, however, survey data in most countries are not available on an annual basis. Therefore, the change in private consumption per capita as measured from the national accounts is used instead. While, there can be no guarantee that the survey-based measure of income or consumption change at exactly the same rate as private consumption in the national accounts, this appears to be the best available option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the reference year falls between two survey years, an estimate of mean consumption at the reference year is constructed by extrapolating the means obtained from the surveys forward and backward to the reference year. The second step is to compute the headcount poverty rate at the reference year after normalizing the distributions observed in the two survey years by the reference year mean. This yields two estimates of the headcount poverty rates in the reference year. The final reported poverty headcount rate for the reference years is the linear interpolation of the two. When data from only one survey year are available, the reference year mean is based on the survey mean by applying the growth rate in private consumption per capita from the national accounts. The reference year poverty estimate is then based on this mean and on the distribution observed in the one survey year. The better data coverage is in terms of number and frequency of available surveys, the more accurate this lining-up process is and the more reliable the regional estimates will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aggregate headcount ratio for a region is the population-weighted mean of the headcount indices across the countries in that region. The number of poor in each region is the product of the region&amp;#x2019;s headcount index and total regional population. This assumes that the poverty rate for a country without a household survey is the regional average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Regional aggregates:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because surveys are not conducted every year in most countries, poverty estimates have to be derived for line-up years by interpolation or extrapolation using national accounts data. These estimates for line-up years are then aggregated to regional and global numbers. Regional and global aggregates are population-weighted averages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data availability (measured in terms of number of countries that have at least 1 data point by region):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2010 to present &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia and Pacific: 23 (40 if modelled estimates are considered); Africa: 23 (48 if modelled estimates are considered); Latin America and Caribbean: 19 (21 if modelled estimates are considered)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan: 17 (25 if modelled estimates are considered)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2000-2009 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia and Pacific: 38 (40 if modelled estimates are considered); Africa: 47 (48 if modelled estimates are considered); Latin America and Caribbean: 21 (21 if modelled estimates are considered)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan: 20 (25 if modelled estimates are considered)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work is underway at the World Bank for disaggregated poverty estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National poverty is a different concept than global poverty. National poverty rate is defined at country-specific poverty lines in local currencies, which are different in real terms across countries and different from the $1.90-a-day international poverty line. Thus, national poverty rates cannot be compared across countries or with the $1.90-a-day poverty rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;References&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Organization(s):&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banco Mundial (BM)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Conceptos y definiciones &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Definición: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; El indicador &amp;#x201C; proporción de la población por debajo del umbral de pobreza internacional &amp;#x201D; se define como el porcentaje de la población que vive con menos de 1,90 dólares al día a precios internacionales de 2011. La línea de pobreza internacional se fija actualmente en 1,90 dólares al día a precios internacionales de 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Conceptos: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Al evaluar la pobreza en un país determinado y la mejor manera de reducirla, naturalmente uno se enfoca en una línea de pobreza que se considera apropiada para ese país. Pero, ¿cómo hablamos de manera significativa sobre &amp;#x201C;la pobreza global&amp;#x201D;? Las líneas de pobreza entre países varían en términos de su poder adquisitivo y tienen un fuerte gradiente económico, de modo que los países más ricos tienden a adoptar niveles de vida más altos al definir la pobreza. Pero para medir consistentemente la pobreza absoluta global en términos de consumo, necesitamos tratar a dos personas con el mismo poder adquisitivo sobre los productos básicos de la misma manera &amp;#x2014; ambos son pobres o no lo son &amp;#x2014; incluso si viven en países diferentes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Desde el Informe sobre el desarrollo mundial de 1990, el Banco Mundial se ha propuesto aplicar un estándar común para medir la pobreza extrema, anclado en lo que significa la pobreza en los países más pobres del mundo. El bienestar de las personas que viven en diferentes países se puede medir en una escala común ajustando las diferencias en el poder adquisitivo de las monedas. Para el Informe sobre el desarrollo mundial de 1990, se eligió el estándar de 1 dólar al día, medido a precios internacionales de 1985 y ajustado a la moneda local mediante PPA, porque era típico de las líneas de pobreza de los países de bajos ingresos en ese momento. A medida que evolucionan las diferencias en el costo de vida en todo el mundo, la línea de pobreza internacional debe actualizarse periódicamente utilizando nuevos datos de precios de PPA para reflejar estos cambios. El último cambio fue en octubre de 2015, cuando el Banco Mundial adoptó $ 1,90 como línea de pobreza internacional utilizando la PPA de 2011. Antes de eso, la actualización de 2008 estableció la línea de pobreza internacional en $ 1,25 utilizando la PPA de 2005. Las medidas de pobreza basadas en líneas de pobreza internacionales intentan mantener constante el valor real de la línea de pobreza en todos los países, como se hace al hacer comparaciones en el tiempo. Las primeras ediciones de los Indicadores de desarrollo mundial (WDI) del Banco Mundial &amp;#x2019; utilizaban las PPA de las Penn World Tables para convertir los valores en moneda local al poder adquisitivo equivalente medido en dólares estadounidenses. En ediciones posteriores se utilizaron estimaciones de la PPA de consumo de 1993, 2005 y 2011 elaboradas por el Programa de Comparación Internacional (PCI) del Banco Mundial &amp;#x2019;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Fuentes de datos&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Descripción:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Banco Mundial suele recibir los datos directamente de las Oficinas Nacionales de Estadística (ONE). En otros casos, utiliza datos de las ONE recibidos indirectamente. Por ejemplo, recibe datos de Eurostat y de LIS (Estudios de Ingresos de Luxemburgo), que proporcionan al Banco Mundial los datos de las ONE que han recibido / armonizado. La Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina, y el Banco Mundial mantienen conjuntamente la base de datos SEDLAC (Base de datos socioeconómicos para América Latina y el Caribe) que incluye estadísticas armonizadas sobre la pobreza y otras variables distributivas y sociales de 24 países de América Latina y el Caribe, basadas en microdatos de encuestas de hogares realizadas por las ONE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Los datos se obtienen a través de programas específicos para cada país, incluyendo programas de asistencia técnica y actividades conjuntas de análisis y desarrollo de capacidades. El Banco Mundial se relaciona con las ONE en programas de trabajo relacionados con los sistemas estadísticos y el análisis de datos. Los economistas especializados en pobreza del Banco Mundial suelen colaborar con las ONE en la medición y el análisis de la pobreza como parte de las actividades de asistencia técnica. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dentro del Banco Mundial, el Grupo de Trabajo sobre Pobreza Mundial (GTPM) se encarga de la recopilación, validación y estimación de las estimaciones de la pobreza. El GTPM archiva los conjuntos de datos obtenidos de las ONE y luego los armoniza, aplicando metodologías comunes. El objetivo del GTPM es garantizar que los datos sobre pobreza y desigualdad generados, curados y difundidos por el Banco Mundial estén actualizados, cumplan con normas de alta calidad y estén bien documentados y sean coherentes en todos los canales de difusión. Los miembros del GTPM generan y actualizan las estimaciones de la proporción de la población que se encuentra por debajo del umbral de pobreza internacional utilizando los datos brutos que suelen proporcionar los gobiernos de los países. Los economistas especializados en pobreza obtienen los datos brutos a través de sus contactos en las ONE, y comprueban su calidad antes de presentarlos para su posterior análisis. Los datos brutos pueden ser datos de encuestas registrados por unidad o datos agrupados, dependiendo de los acuerdos con los gobiernos de los países. En la mayoría de los casos, el agregado de bienestar, elemento esencial para la estimación de la pobreza, es generado por los gobiernos de los países. A veces, el Banco Mundial tiene que construir el agregado de bienestar o ajustar el agregado proporcionado por el país.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lista:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directamente de las Oficinas Nacionales de Estadística (ONE) o indirectamente de otras &amp;#x2013; ver sección de fuentes de datos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Proceso de recopilación:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Banco Mundial comparte y hace públicas de forma transparente las metodologías para todo tipo de ajustes de los datos originales (por ejemplo, a través de su sitio web PovcalNet y sus diversos documentos analíticos). Las estimaciones de pobreza son desarrolladas por economistas, que trabajan estrechamente con sus contrapartes de los gobiernos nacionales en relación con cada actualización de los datos sobre pobreza. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Calendario&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recolección de datos:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La recopilación de fuentes está a cargo del Grupo de Trabajo sobre Pobreza Mundial del Banco Mundial. El cálculo de las nuevas cifras de pobreza, utilizando los datos actualizados de la fuente, normalmente se realiza de mayo a septiembre de cada año. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Publicación de datos: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; El Grupo del Banco Mundial se compromete a actualizar los datos sobre pobreza todos los años. Las estimaciones actualizadas se publican en las Reuniones Anuales del Banco Mundial en octubre de cada año. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Proveedores de datos&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt; El Banco Mundial normalmente recibe datos de las Oficinas Nacionales de Estadística (ONE) directamente. En otros casos utiliza datos de las ONE recibidos indirectamente. Para más detalles, consulte la sección sobre fuentes de datos &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Compiladores de datos&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banco Mundial&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Justificación: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; El seguimiento de la pobreza es importante en la agenda de desarrollo mundial, así como en la agenda de desarrollo nacional de muchos países. El Banco Mundial produjo sus primeras estimaciones de pobreza global para países en desarrollo para el Informe sobre el desarrollo mundial de 1990: Pobreza (Banco Mundial 1990) utilizando datos de encuestas de hogares de 22 países (Ravallion, Datt y van de Walle 1991). Desde entonces ha habido una expansión considerable en el número de países que realizan encuestas de ingresos y gastos de los hogares. El Grupo de Investigación sobre el Desarrollo del Banco Mundial mantiene una base de datos que se actualiza anualmente a medida que se dispone de nuevos datos de encuestas (y, por lo tanto, pueden contener datos o revisiones más recientes) y realiza una importante reevaluación del progreso contra la pobreza cada año. PovcalNet es una herramienta digital interactiva que permite a los usuarios replicar estas estimaciones internacionalmente comparables de pobreza de $ 1,90 y $ 3,20 por día a nivel mundial, regional y nacional, y calcular medidas de pobreza para agrupaciones de países personalizadas y para diferentes líneas de pobreza. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; El Portal de Datos sobre Pobreza y Equidad brinda acceso a la base de datos y tableros fáciles de usar con gráficos y mapas interactivos que visualizan tendencias en indicadores clave de pobreza y desigualdad para diferentes regiones y países. Los tableros de países muestran las tendencias en las mediciones de pobreza basadas en las líneas de pobreza nacionales junto con las estimaciones comparables internacionalmente, elaboradas y consistentes con PovcalNet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Comentarios y limitaciones: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Cinco países &amp;#x2013; Bangladesh, Cabo Verde, Camboya, Jordania y Laos &amp;#x2013; utilizan los factores de conversión de la PPA de 2005 y las correspondientes líneas de pobreza de 1,25 dólares al día y 2 dólares al día. Esto se debe a las grandes desviaciones en la tasa de variación de los factores PPA en relación con la tasa de variación de los índices de precios al consumidor internos. Véase el recuadro 1.1 del Informe de seguimiento mundial 2015/2016 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-monitoring-report&quot;&gt;http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-monitoring-report&lt;/a&gt;) para obtener una explicación detallada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; A pesar de los avances en la última década, persisten los desafíos de medir la pobreza. La puntualidad, frecuencia, calidad y comparabilidad de las encuestas de hogares debe aumentar sustancialmente, particularmente en los países más pobres. La disponibilidad y calidad de los datos de seguimiento de la pobreza sigue siendo baja en los estados pequeños, países con situaciones frágiles y países de bajos ingresos e incluso algunos países de ingresos medios. La baja frecuencia y la falta de comparabilidad de los datos disponibles en algunos países crean incertidumbre sobre la magnitud de la reducción de la pobreza. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Además de la frecuencia y puntualidad de los datos de las encuestas, surgen otros problemas de calidad de los datos al medir las condiciones de vida de los hogares. Las encuestas hacen preguntas detalladas sobre las fuentes de ingresos y cómo se gastaron, que deben ser cuidadosamente registradas por personal capacitado. Por lo general, la renta es más difícil de medir con precisión y el consumo se acerca más a la noción de condiciones de vida. Y los ingresos pueden variar con el tiempo, incluso si las condiciones de vida no varían. Pero los datos sobre el consumo no siempre están disponibles: las últimas estimaciones que se informan aquí utilizan datos sobre el consumo de aproximadamente dos tercios de los países. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Sin embargo, incluso encuestas similares pueden no ser estrictamente comparables debido a diferencias en el tiempo o en la calidad y capacitación de los encuestadores. Las comparaciones entre países con diferentes niveles de desarrollo también plantean un problema potencial debido a las diferencias en la importancia relativa del consumo de bienes no comerciales. El valor local de mercado de todo el consumo en especie (incluida la producción propia, que es particularmente importante en las economías rurales subdesarrolladas) debe incluirse en el gasto de consumo total, pero puede que no lo esté. La mayoría de los datos de las encuestas incluyen ahora valoraciones del consumo o de los ingresos de la producción propia, pero los métodos de valoración varían. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Metodología &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Método de cálculo: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Para medir la pobreza en todos los países de manera coherente, las medidas internacionales del Banco Mundial aplican un estándar común, anclado a lo que &amp;#x201C;significa la pobreza&amp;#x201D; en los países más pobres del mundo. La línea original de &amp;#x201C;$ 1 dólar por día&amp;#x201D; se basó en una compilación de líneas nacionales para solo 22 países en desarrollo, principalmente de estudios académicos de la década de 1980 (Ravallion, et al., 1991). Si bien esto era lo mejor que se podía hacer en ese momento, la muestra era, incluso en los años ochenta, apenas representativa de los países en desarrollo. Desde entonces, se han desarrollado líneas de pobreza nacionales para muchos otros países. Sobre la base de una nueva compilación de líneas nacionales para 75 países en desarrollo, Ravallion, Chen y Sangraula (RCS) (2009) propusieron una nueva línea internacional de pobreza de 1,25 dólares al día. Esta es la línea de pobreza promedio de los 15 países más pobres en su conjunto de datos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; La línea de pobreza extrema actual se fija en 1,90 dólares al día en términos de PPA de 2011, que representa la media de las líneas de pobreza nacionales que se encuentran en los mismos 15 países más pobres clasificados según el consumo per cápita. La nueva línea de pobreza mantiene el mismo estándar para la pobreza extrema (la línea de pobreza típica de los países más pobres del mundo), pero la actualiza utilizando la información más reciente sobre el costo de vida en los países en desarrollo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Al medir la pobreza internacional de un país, la línea de pobreza internacional en PPA se convierte a las monedas locales al precio de 2011 y luego se convierte a los precios vigentes en el momento de la encuesta de hogares pertinente utilizando el mejor índice de precios al consumidor disponible (IPC). (De manera equivalente, los datos sobre consumo o ingresos de los hogares para el año de la encuesta se expresan en los precios del año base del IPC y luego se convierten a PPA $). Luego, la tasa de pobreza se calcula a partir de esa encuesta. Todas las comparaciones intertemporales son en términos reales, evaluadas mediante el uso del IPC específico del país. Se utilizan métodos de interpolación / extrapolación para alinear las estimaciones basadas en encuestas con estos años de referencia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Tratamiento de valores faltantes:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A nivel de país:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; No existe una &amp;#x201C;imputación&amp;#x201D; en el sentido tradicional para la falta de datos de país. Sin embargo, para generar agregados regionales y globales para los años de referencia, los datos a nivel de país se imputan para los años en que no se realizan encuestas. Estos datos imputados se utilizarán para la agregación, pero no para reemplazar los datos reales de la encuesta. La sección siguiente sobre el tratamiento de los valores que faltan a nivel regional y mundial proporciona más detalles sobre el método de imputación. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A nivel regional y mundial:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Para comparar las tasas de pobreza entre países y calcular los agregados regionales, las estimaciones de los países deben estar &amp;#x201C;alineadas primero&amp;#x201D; a un año de referencia común, interpolando para los países en los que los datos de encuesta no están disponibles en el año de referencia, pero están disponibles antes, después o ambos. Cuantos más datos de encuesta estén disponibles (es decir, más datos para diferentes años), más precisa será la interpolación. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; El proceso requiere ajustar los ingresos o gastos medios observados en el año de la encuesta por un factor de crecimiento para inferir el nivel no observado en el año de referencia. Por lo tanto, se requieren dos supuestos para implementar este proceso: crecimiento con efecto neutral sobre la distribución y una tasa real de crecimiento entre la encuesta y el año de referencia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; El crecimiento con efecto neutral sobre la distribución implica que los niveles de ingresos o gastos se ajustan con el crecimiento asumiendo que la distribución relativa subyacente de los ingresos o gastos observados en los años de la encuesta permanece sin cambios. Bajo esta hipótesis, es sencillo interpolar la estimación de pobreza en un año de referencia determinado, a través de la tasa determinada de crecimiento de los ingresos o los gastos. Las tasas de cambio en el consumo real per cápita deben estar basadas en el cambio en el consumo real medido comparando los datos de encuestas de los países a lo largo de diferentes años. En la práctica, sin embargo, en la mayoría de los países no existen datos de encuesta disponibles anualmente. Por lo tanto, se utiliza en su lugar el cambio en el consumo privado per cápita medido a partir de las cuentas nacionales. Aunque no se puede garantizar que el ingreso o el consumo medidos en base a encuestas cambie exactamente al mismo ritmo que el consumo privado de las cuentas nacionales, esta parece ser la mejor opción disponible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Cuando el año de referencia se encuentra entre dos años de encuesta, se construye una estimación del consumo medio en el año de referencia extrapolando las medias obtenidas de las encuestas hacia adelante y hacia atrás al año de referencia. El segundo paso es calcular la tasa de pobreza en el año de referencia después de normalizar las distribuciones observadas en los dos años de encuesta por la media del año de referencia. De este modo se obtienen dos estimaciones de tasa de pobreza en el año de referencia. La tasa final de pobreza para el año de referencia es la interpolación lineal de las dos. Cuando sólo se dispone de datos de un año de encuesta, la media del año de referencia se basa en la media de la encuesta aplicando la tasa de crecimiento del consumo privado per cápita de las cuentas nacionales. La estimación de pobreza del año de referencia se basa entonces en esta media y en la distribución observada en el único año de la encuesta. Cuanto mejor sea la cobertura de los datos en términos de número y frecuencia de las encuestas disponibles, más preciso será este proceso de alineación y más fiables serán las estimaciones regionales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; La tasa agregada de una región es la media ponderada por población de los índices de todos los países de esa región. El número de pobres en cada región es el producto del índice de la región por la población regional total. Esto supone que la tasa de pobreza para un país sin una encuesta de hogares es el promedio regional. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Agregados regionales:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dado que en la mayoría de los países no se realizan encuestas todos los años, las estimaciones de pobreza tienen que obtenerse para los años de referencia mediante interpolación o extrapolación utilizando los datos de las cuentas nacionales. Estas estimaciones para los años de referencia se agregan luego a las cifras regionales y globales. Los agregados regionales y globales son medias ponderadas por población.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Disponibilidad de datos &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Descripción: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Disponibilidad de datos (medida en términos del número de países que tienen al menos 1 punto de dato por región): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt; 2010 hasta el presente &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Asia y el Pacífico: 23 (40 si se consideran estimaciones modeladas); África: 23 (48 si se consideran estimaciones modeladas); América Latina y el Caribe: 19 (21 si se consideran estimaciones modeladas) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Europa, América del Norte, Australia, Nueva Zelanda y Japón: 17 (25 si se consideran estimaciones modeladas) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt; 2000-2009 &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Asia y el Pacífico: 38 (40 si se consideran estimaciones modeladas); África: 47 (48 si se consideran estimaciones modeladas); América Latina y el Caribe: 21 (21 si se consideran estimaciones modeladas) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Europa, América del Norte, Australia, Nueva Zelanda y Japón: 20 (25 si se consideran estimaciones modeladas) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Desagregación: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; El Banco Mundial está trabajando en la elaboración de estimaciones desagregadas de pobreza. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Fuentes de discrepancias:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; La pobreza nacional es un concepto diferente a la pobreza mundial. La tasa de pobreza nacional se define en líneas de pobreza específicas de cada país en monedas locales, que son diferentes en términos reales entre países y diferentes de la línea de pobreza internacional de $1,90 dólares al día. Por lo tanto, las tasas de pobreza nacionales no se pueden comparar entre países ni con la tasa de pobreza de $1,90 dólares al día. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Referencias&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banque mondiale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Concepts et définitions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Définition :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L&apos;indicateur &amp;#x201C ;proportion de la population sous le seuil de pauvreté international&amp;#x201D ; est défini comme le pourcentage de la population vivant avec moins de 1,90 $ par jour aux prix internationaux de 2011. L&apos;indicateur &amp;#x201C ;seuil de pauvreté international&amp;#x201D ; est actuellement fixé à 1,90 $ par jour aux prix internationaux de 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pour évaluer la pauvreté dans un pays donné et identifier la meilleure façon de la réduire, on se concentre sur un seuil de pauvreté jugé approprié pour ce dernier. Mais comment parler de manière significative de “la pauvreté dans le monde” ? Les seuils de pauvreté varient d&apos;un pays à l&apos;autre en fonction des pouvoirs d&apos;achat et ont tendance dans les pays les plus riches à être plus élevés. Mais pour mesurer de manière cohérente la pauvreté absolue mondiale en termes de consommation, nous devons traiter de la même manière deux personnes ayant le même pouvoir d&apos;achat, soit que les deux sont pauvres ou pas, même si elles vivent dans des pays différents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depuis le Rapport sur le développement dans le monde 1990, la Banque mondiale s&apos;efforce d&apos;appliquer une norme commune pour mesurer l&apos;extrême pauvreté, en se basant sur ce que signifie la pauvreté dans les pays les plus pauvres du monde. Le bien-être des personnes vivant dans différents pays peut être mesuré sur une échelle commune en ajustant les différences de pouvoir d&apos;achat des devises. La norme communément utilisée d&apos;un dollar par jour, mesurée aux prix internationaux de 1985 et ajustée à la devise locale à l&apos;aide de la parité des pouvoirs d&apos;achat (PPA), a été choisie pour le Rapport sur le développement dans le monde 1990 parce qu&apos;elle était typique des seuils de pauvreté dans les pays à faible revenu de l&apos;époque. Comme les différences de coût de la vie dans le monde évoluent, le seuil de pauvreté international doit être périodiquement mis à jour à l&apos;aide de nouvelles données sur les prix de la PPA pour refléter ces changements. La dernière modification remonte à octobre 2015, lorsque la Banque mondiale a adopté le seuil de pauvreté international de 1,90 $ en utilisant la PPA de 2011. Avant cela, la mise à jour de 2008 avait fixé le seuil de pauvreté international à 1,25 $ en utilisant la PPA de 2005. Les mesures de la pauvreté basées sur les seuils de pauvreté internationaux tentent de maintenir constante la valeur réelle du seuil de pauvreté entre les pays, comme cela est fait lors de comparaisons dans le temps. Les premières éditions des Indicateurs du développement dans le monde (IDM) de la Banque mondiale utilisaient les PPA des Penn World Tables pour convertir les valeurs en devise locale, en pouvoir d&apos;achat équivalent mesuré en dollars américain. Les éditions ultérieures ont utilisé les estimations des PPA de consommation de 1993, 2005 et 2011 produites par le Programme de comparaison internationale (PCI) de la Banque mondiale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Sources de données&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Banque mondiale reçoit généralement les données directement des Bureaux nationaux de statistiques (BNS). Dans certains cas, la Banque utilise des données reçues indirectement. Par exemple, elle reçoit des données d&apos;Eurostat et de l&apos;Étude sur le revenu du Luxembourg (LIS), qui lui fournissent les données qu&apos;ils ont reçues / harmonisées. L&apos;Universidad Nacional de La Plata, l&apos;Argentine et la Banque mondiale gèrent conjointement la base de données SEDLAC (Socio-Economic Database for Latin American and Caribbean), qui comprend des statistiques harmonisées sur la pauvreté et d&apos;autres variables distributionnelles et sociales de 24 pays d&apos;Amérique latine et des Caraïbes, basées sur des microdonnées provenant d&apos;enquêtes auprès des ménages menées par les BNS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les données sont obtenues dans le cadre de programmes spécifiques à chaque pays, notamment des programmes d&apos;assistance technique et des activités conjointes d&apos;analyse et de renforcement des capacités. La Banque mondiale entretient des relations avec les BNS sur des programmes de travail impliquant des systèmes statistiques et d&apos;analyse de données. La Banque mondiale travaille généralement avec les BNS sur la mesure et l&apos;analyse de la pauvreté dans le cadre des activités d&apos;assistance technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Au sein de la Banque mondiale, le Groupe de travail sur la pauvreté mondiale (GPWG) est responsable de la collecte, de la validation et de la compilation des estimations de la pauvreté. Le GPWG archive les ensembles de données obtenus des BNS et les harmonise ensuite en appliquant des méthodologies communes. L&apos;objectif du GPWG est de s&apos;assurer que les données sur la pauvreté et les inégalités générées, conservées et diffusées par la Banque mondiale sont à jour, répondent à des normes de haute qualité, sont bien documentées et sont cohérentes d&apos;un canal de diffusion à l&apos;autre. Les membres du GPWG produisent et mettent à jour les estimations de la proportion de la population vivant sous le seuil de pauvreté international en utilisant les données brutes généralement fournies par les gouvernements nationaux. Les données brutes sont obtenues par les économistes de la pauvreté par l&apos;intermédiaire de leurs contacts dans les BNS, et leur qualité est vérifiée avant d&apos;être soumise à une analyse plus approfondie. Les données brutes peuvent être des données unitaires d&apos;enquêtes ou des données groupées, selon les accords conclus avec les gouvernements nationaux. Dans la plupart des cas, l&apos;agrégat de bien-être, élément essentiel pour l&apos;estimation de la pauvreté, est généré par les gouvernements nationaux. Parfois, la Banque mondiale doit construire l&apos;agrégat du bien-être ou ajuster l&apos;agrégat fourni par le pays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directement des BNS ou indirectement d&apos;autres sources &amp;#x2013; voir la section Sources de données.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Procédure de collecte :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Banque mondiale partage et rend publiques de manière transparente les méthodologies pour toutes sortes d&apos;ajustements aux données originales (par exemple, par le biais de son site web PovcalNet et de ses divers documents analytiques). Les estimations de la pauvreté sont élaborées par des économistes, qui travaillent en étroite collaboration avec leurs homologues des gouvernements nationaux pour chaque mise à jour des données sur la pauvreté. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Calendrier&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Collecte de données :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La collecte des données de base est en cours par le GPWG de la Banque mondiale. Le calcul des nouvelles estimations de la pauvreté à l&apos;aide de données de base mises à jour a normalement lieu chaque année, de mai à septembre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Publication des données:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le GPWG de la Banque mondiale s&apos;est engagé à mettre à jour les données sur la pauvreté chaque année. Les estimations mises à jour sont publiées lors de l&apos;assemblée annuelle de la Banque mondiale, en octobre de chaque année.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Fournisseurs de données&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Banque mondiale reçoit généralement les données directement des ONS. Dans d&apos;autres cas, elle utilise les données des ONS reçues indirectement. Il est possible de consulter la section Sources de données pour plus de détails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Compilateur des données&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banque mondiale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Justification :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La surveillance de la pauvreté importe dans le programme de développement mondial ainsi que dans celui de développement national de nombreux pays. La Banque mondiale a produit ses premières estimations de la pauvreté dans les pays en développement pour le Rapport sur le développement dans le monde 1990 : Pauvreté (Banque mondiale 1990) en utilisant des données d&apos;enquêtes sur les ménages pour 22 pays (Ravallion, Datt, et van de Walle 1991). Depuis lors, le nombre de pays qui réalisent des enquêtes sur les revenus et les dépenses des ménages a considérablement augmenté. Le Groupe de recherche sur le développement de la Banque mondiale maintient une base de données qui est mise à jour chaque année à mesure que de nouvelles données d&apos;enquête sont disponibles (et peut donc contenir des données plus récentes ou des révisions) et procède chaque année à une réévaluation majeure des progrès réalisés dans la lutte contre la pauvreté. PovcalNet est un outil de calcul interactif qui permet aux utilisateurs de reproduire ces estimations de la pauvreté comparables au niveau international de 1,90 $ et 3,10 $ par jour, au niveau mondial, régional et national et de calculer des mesures de la pauvreté pour des regroupements de pays personnalisés et pour différents seuils de pauvreté. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le Portail des données sur la pauvreté et l&apos;équité donne accès à la base de données et à des tableaux de bord conviviaux avec des graphiques et des cartes interactives qui permettent de visualiser les tendances des principaux indicateurs de pauvreté et d&apos;inégalité pour différentes régions et pays. Les tableaux de bord des pays affichent les tendances des mesures de la pauvreté basées sur des seuils de pauvreté nationaux ainsi que des estimations comparables au niveau international, produites à partir de PovcalNet et de façon cohérente avec celui-ci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Commentaires et limites :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cinq pays ; Bangladesh, Cap-Vert, Cambodge, Jordanie et Laos, utilisent les facteurs de conversion de PPA de 2005 et les seuils de pauvreté correspondants de 1,25 $ par jour et 2 $ par jour. Cela est dû aux écarts importants entre le taux de variation des facteurs de la PPA et le taux de variation des indices des prix à la consommation intérieurs. Veuillez consulter l&apos;encadré 1.1 du Rapport de suivi mondial 2015/2016 (&lt;a href=&quot;https ://reliefweb.int/report/world/rapport-de-suivi-mondial-20152016-objectifs-de-d-veloppement-dans-une-re-de-changement&quot;&gt;https ://reliefweb.int/report/world/rapport-de-suivi-mondial-20152016-objectifs-de-d-veloppement-dans-une-re-de-changement&lt;/a&gt;) pour une explication détaillée.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malgré les progrès réalisés au cours de la dernière décennie, la mesure de la pauvreté demeure un défi. L&apos;actualité, la fréquence, la qualité et la comparabilité des enquêtes sur les ménages doivent augmenter considérablement, en particulier dans les pays les plus pauvres. La disponibilité et la qualité des données pour le suivi de la pauvreté demeurent faibles dans les petits états, les pays en situation précaire, ceux à faible revenu et même certains pays à revenu intermédiaire. La faible fréquence et le manque de comparabilité des données disponibles dans certains pays créent une incertitude quant à l&apos;ampleur de la réduction de la pauvreté.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En plus de la fréquence et de l&apos;actualité des données d&apos;enquête, d&apos;autres problèmes liés à la qualité des données se posent lors de la mesure du niveau de vie des ménages. Les enquêtes incluent des questions détaillées sur les sources de revenus et la manière dont ils ont été dépensés qui doivent être soigneusement enregistrées par un personnel qualifié. Les revenus sont généralement plus difficiles à mesurer avec précision, et la consommation se rapproche de la notion de niveau de vie. De plus, les revenus peuvent varier dans le temps, même si le niveau de vie ne varie pas. Par contre, les données sur la consommation ne sont pas toujours disponibles : les dernières estimations présentées ici utilisent des données sur la consommation pour environ deux tiers des pays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toutefois, des enquêtes similaires peuvent ne pas être strictement comparables en raison de différences dans le calendrier ou dans la qualité et la formation des recenseurs. Les comparaisons entre des pays ayant des niveaux de développement différents posent également un problème potentiel en raison des différences dans l&apos;importance relative de la consommation de biens non marchands. La valeur marchande locale de toute consommation en nature (y compris la production propre, particulièrement importante dans les économies rurales sous-développées) doit être incluse dans les dépenses totales de consommation, mais ne l&apos;est pas forcément. La plupart des données d&apos;enquête comprennent maintenant des évaluations pour la consommation ou le revenu de la production propre, mais les méthodes d&apos;évaluation varient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Méthodologie&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Méthode de calcul :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pour mesurer la pauvreté de manière cohérente dans les différents pays, les mesures internationales de la Banque mondiale appliquent une norme commune, ancrée sur ce que «pauvreté» signifie dans les pays les plus pauvres du monde. Le seuil original de «1$ par jour» était basé sur une compilation de seuils nationaux pour seulement 22 pays en développement, provenant principalement d&apos;études académiques des années 1980 (Ravallion, et coll., 1991). Bien qu&apos;il s&apos;agisse de la meilleure méthode disponible à l&apos;époque, l&apos;échantillon n&apos;était guère représentatif des pays en développement, même dans les années 80. Depuis lors, des seuils de pauvreté nationaux ont été établis pour de nombreux autres pays. Sur la base d&apos;une nouvelle compilation des seuils nationaux pour 75 pays en développement, Ravallion, Chen et Sangraula (RCS) (2009) ont proposé un nouveau seuil de pauvreté international de 1,25 $ par jour. Il s&apos;agit du seuil de pauvreté moyen pour les 15 pays les plus pauvres de leur base de données.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le seuil de pauvreté extrême actuel est fixé à 1,90 $ par jour en PPA de 2011, ce qui représente la moyenne des seuils de pauvreté nationaux des 15 pays les plus pauvres classés selon la consommation par habitant. Le nouveau seuil de pauvreté maintient la même norme pour l&apos;extrême pauvreté, le seuil de pauvreté typique des pays les plus pauvres du monde, mais le met à jour en utilisant les informations les plus récentes sur le coût de la vie dans les pays en développement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lors de la mesure de la pauvreté internationale d&apos;un pays, le seuil de pauvreté international en PPA est converti en monnaie locale au prix de 2011 et est ensuite converti aux prix en vigueur au moment de l&apos;enquête auprès des ménages concernés en utilisant le meilleur indice des prix à la consommation (IPC) disponible. (De même, les données de l&apos;enquête sur la consommation ou le revenu des ménages pour l&apos;année d&apos;enquête sont exprimées aux prix de l&apos;année de base du PCI, puis converties en dollars de PPA.) Le taux de pauvreté est ensuite calculé à partir de cette enquête. Toutes les comparaisons intertemporelles sont en termes réels, car elles sont évaluées à l&apos;aide de l&apos;IPC spécifique au pays. Des méthodes d&apos;interpolation/extrapolation sont utilisées pour aligner les estimations basées sur l&apos;enquête avec ces années de référence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Traitement des valeurs manquantes :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Au niveau national :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il n&apos;y a pas d&apos;«imputation» au sens traditionnel du terme pour les données nationales manquantes. Toutefois, pour générer des agrégats régionaux et mondiaux pour les années de référence, les données nationales sont imputées pour les années où aucune enquête n&apos;est menée. Ces données imputées sont utilisées pour l&apos;agrégation, mais pas pour remplacer les données d&apos;enquête réelles. La section suivante sur le traitement des valeurs manquantes aux niveaux régional et mondial fournit plus de détails sur la méthode d&apos;imputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aux niveaux régional et mondial :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pour comparer les taux de pauvreté entre pays et calculer des agrégats régionaux, les estimations des pays doivent d&apos;abord être «alignées» sur une année de référence commune, en interpolant pour les pays pour lesquels les données d&apos;enquête ne sont pas disponibles pour l&apos;année de référence, mais sont disponibles soit avant, soit après, soit les deux. Plus il y a de données d&apos;enquête disponibles (c&apos;est-à-dire plus il y a de données pour différentes années), plus l&apos;interpolation est précise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le processus nécessite d&apos;ajuster la moyenne des revenus ou des dépenses observés au cours de l&apos;année d&apos;enquête par un facteur de croissance pour en déduire le niveau non observé au cours de l&apos;année de référence. Ainsi, deux hypothèses sont nécessaires pour mettre en œuvre ce processus : une croissance neutre en termes de distribution et un taux de croissance réel entre l&apos;année d&apos;enquête et l&apos;année de référence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La croissance neutre en termes de distribution implique que la distribution relative des revenus ou des dépenses observée au cours des années d&apos;enquête reste inchangée. Sous cette hypothèse, il est facile d&apos;interpoler l&apos;estimation de la pauvreté pour une année de référence donnée selon un taux de croissance donné des revenus ou des dépenses. Les taux de variation de la consommation réelle par habitant doivent être basés sur la variation de la consommation réelle mesurée en comparant les données d&apos;enquête des pays sur différentes années. Dans la pratique, cependant, les données d&apos;enquête ne sont pas disponibles sur une base annuelle, et ce pour la plupart des pays. Par conséquent, on utilise à la place : la variation de la consommation privée par habitant telle que mesurée à partir des comptes nationaux. Bien qu&apos;il ne soit pas possible de garantir que la mesure du revenu ou de la consommation basée sur l&apos;enquête, évolue exactement au même rythme que la consommation privée dans les comptes nationaux, il semble que ce soit la meilleure option disponible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorsque l&apos;année de référence se situe entre deux années d&apos;enquête, une estimation de la consommation moyenne pour l&apos;année de référence est construite en extrapolant les moyennes obtenues à partir des enquêtes précédant et suivant l&apos;année de référence. La deuxième étape consiste à calculer le taux de pauvreté par habitant à l&apos;année de référence après avoir normalisé les distributions observées au cours des deux années d&apos;enquête par la moyenne de l&apos;année de référence. On obtient ainsi deux estimations des taux de pauvreté par habitant au cours de l&apos;année de référence. Le taux de pauvreté par habitant final déclaré pour les années de référence est l&apos;interpolation linéaire des deux. Lorsque les données d&apos;une seule année d&apos;enquête sont disponibles, la moyenne de l&apos;année de référence est basée sur la moyenne de l&apos;enquête en appliquant le taux de croissance de la consommation privée par habitant provenant des comptes nationaux. L&apos;estimation de la pauvreté pour l&apos;année de référence est alors basée sur cette moyenne et sur la distribution observée au cours de la seule année d&apos;enquête. Plus la couverture des données est bonne en termes de nombre et de fréquence des enquêtes disponibles, plus ce processus d&apos;alignement est précis et plus les estimations régionales sont fiables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le ratio agrégé par habitant pour une région est la moyenne pondérée selon la population des indices de pauvreté dans les pays de cette région. Le nombre de pauvres dans chaque région est le produit de l&amp;#8217indice de pauvreté de la région et de la population régionale totale. Cela suppose que le taux de pauvreté d&apos;un pays sans enquête sur les ménages est égal à la moyenne régionale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Agrégats régionaux :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comme les enquêtes ne sont pas menées chaque année dans la plupart des pays, les estimations de la pauvreté doivent être établies pour les années de référence par interpolation ou extrapolation en utilisant les données des comptes nationaux. Ces estimations pour les années de référence sont ensuite agrégées aux niveaux régional et mondial. Les agrégats régionaux et mondiaux sont des moyennes pondérées en fonction de la population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Disponibilité des données&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La pauvreté nationale est un concept différent de la pauvreté mondiale. Le taux de pauvreté national est défini par des seuils de pauvreté spécifiques à chaque pays, en monnaie locale, qui diffèrent en termes réels d&apos;un pays à l&apos;autre et qui sont différents du seuil de pauvreté international de 1,90 $ par jour. Ainsi, les taux de pauvreté nationaux ne peuvent pas être comparés entre les pays ou avec le taux de pauvreté de 1,90 $ par jour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Références&lt;/h1&gt;

США в день)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Показатель 1.1.1: Доля населения, живущего за международной чертой бедности, в разбивке по полу, возрасту, статусу занятости и месту проживания (городское/сельское)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Сентябрь 2020 г.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Институциональная информация&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Организация(и):&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Всемирный банк (ВБ)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Понятия и определения&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Определение:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Показатель &amp; # x201C; доля населения, живущего ниже международной черты бедности &amp; # x201D; определяется как доля населения, живущего менее чем на 1,90 долл. США в день в международных ценах 2011 года. «Международная черта бедности» в настоящее время установлена на уровне 1,90 доллара США в день в международных ценах 2011 года.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Понятия:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;При оценке уровня бедности в данной стране и определении наилучших способов сокращения бедности, естественно, основное внимание уделяется черте бедности, которая считается обоснованной для данной страны. Однако, что мы имеем ввиду, говоря о глобальной бедности? Уровни бедности в разных странах различаются с точки зрения покупательной способности в этих странах, и эти уровни показывают значительную разницу в экономическом плане, при этом более богатые страны, как правило, принимают более высокий уровень жизни при определении бедности. Однако для сопоставимой оценки глобальной абсолютной бедности с точки зрения потребления нам необходимо проанализировать, с использованием одних и тех же методов, состояние двух человек с одинаковой покупательной способностью в отношении товаров; оба они должны быть либо бедными, либо не бедными, даже если они живут в разных странах.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Начиная со времени подготовки Доклада о мировом развитии за 1990 год, Всемирный банк стремился к тому, чтобы применять общий стандарт для оценки крайней нищеты, основываясь на том, что означает нищета в беднейших странах мира. Благосостояние людей, живущих в разных странах, может быть оценено по общей шкале путем корректировки с учетом различий в покупательной способности валют. Широко используемый стандарт в размере 1 долл. США в день, оцененный в международных ценах 1985 г. и скорректированный на местную валюту с использованием данных по ППС, был выбран для Доклада о мировом развитии за 1990 г., поскольку в то время он был распространенной чертой бедности в странах с низким уровнем дохода. По мере нарастания различий в стоимости жизни в различных странах мира международная черта бедности должна была периодически обновляться с использованием новых данных о ценах по ППС для отражения этих изменений. Последнее изменение произошло в октябре 2015 года, когда Всемирный банк принял значение 1,90 доллара США в качестве международной черты бедности с использованием данных по ППС 2011 года. До этого в обновленном варианте 2008 года международная черта бедности была установлена на уровне 1,25 долл. США с использованием данных по ППС 2005 года. Оценки бедности, основанные на международных уровнях бедности, призваны сохранить реальное значение уровня бедности постоянным при сравнении разных стран, как это делается при проведении сравнений в динамике по времени. В ранних изданиях Показателей мирового развития (ПМР) Всемирного банка использовались данные по ППС из Таблиц Penn World для конвертации значений в местной валюте в эквивалент покупательной способности, измеряемый в долларах США. В более поздних изданиях использовались оценки потребления по ППС 1993, 2005 и 2011 годов, подготовленные по Программе международных сопоставлений (ПМС) Всемирного банка. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Источники данных &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Описание&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Всемирный банк (ВБ) обычно получает данные от национальных статистических управлений (НСУ) напрямую. В некоторых случаях ВБ использует данные НСУ, полученные косвенным путем. Например, ВБ получает данные из Евростата и LIS (Luxemburg Income Study - Люксембургское исследование доходов), предоставляющих Всемирному банку данные НСУ, которые они получают / гармонизируют. Национальный университет штата Ла-Плата (Аргентина) и Всемирный банк совместно ведут базу данных SEDLAC (Социально-экономическая база данных для стран Латинской Америки и Карибского бассейна), которая включает в себя гармонизированные статистические данные по бедности и другие обобщенные и социальные переменные по 24 странам Латинской Америки и Карибского бассейна, основанные на микроданных, получаемых в ходе обследований домашних хозяйств, проводимых национальными статистическими управлениями.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Данные получаются посредством реализации специфических страновых программ, включая программы технической помощи, совместной аналитической деятельности и мероприятий по наращиванию потенциала. Всемирный банк сотрудничает с национальными статистическими управлениями в рамках рабочих программ, включающих статистические системы и анализ данных. Экономисты Всемирного банка, занимающиеся вопросами бедности, обычно взаимодействуют с национальными статистическими управлениями по широкому кругу вопросов, касающихся оценки и анализа бедности в рамках деятельности по оказанию технической помощи.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;В структуре Всемирного банка существует Рабочая группа по борьбе с глобальной бедностью (РГГБ), которая отвечает за сбор, валидацию и анализ оценок бедности. РГГБ организовывает загрузку наборов данных, полученных от национальных статистических управлений, а затем осуществляет их гармонизацию, применяя общие методологии. Цель РГГБ заключается в обеспечении того, чтобы данные по бедности и неравенству, создаваемые, тщательно отбираемые и распространяемые Всемирным банком, были актуальными, соответствовали высоким стандартам качества, были хорошо обоснованными и взаимоувязанными при распространении по различным каналам. Члены РГГБ создают и обновляют оценки, касающиеся доли населения, живущего ниже международной черты бедности, используя исходные данные, обычно предоставляемые правительственными органами стран. Первичные данные получаются экономистами по вопросам бедности через их контактных лиц в национальных статистических управлениях и проверяются по параметрам качества перед отправкой для дальнейшего анализа. Первичные данные могут быть единичными записями данных обследования или сгруппированными данными, в зависимости от соглашений с правительствами стран. В большинстве случаев агрегированные данные по благосостоянию, являющиеся существенным элементом для оценки бедности, создаются правительственными органами стран. Но иногда Всемирному банку приходится строить агрегированные данные по благосостоянию или корректировать агрегированные данные, предоставляемые страной.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Список:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Непосредственно из национальных статистических управлений (НСУ) или косвенно из других источников - см. раздел об источниках данных.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Процесс сбора&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Всемирный банк абсолютно прозрачным методом предоставляет для общего пользования и делает доступными для широкой общественности методологические материалы по всем видам корректировок исходных данных (например, через свой веб-сайт PovcalNet и различные аналитические документы). Оценки бедности разрабатываются экономистами, тесно взаимодействующими с коллегами из национальных правительственных органов относительно каждого обновления данных по бедности. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Календарь&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Сбор данных&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Сбор исходных данных осуществляется постоянно Рабочей группой по борьбе с глобальной бедностью, созданной Всемирным банком. Расчет новых данных по показателям бедности с использованием обновленных исходных данных обычно проводится с мая по сентябрь ежегодно.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Выпуск данных&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Группа Всемирного банка взяла на себя обязательство обновлять данные по бедности каждый год. Обновленные оценки распространяются в ходе Ежегодных совещаний Всемирного банка, проходящих каждый год в октябре.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Поставщики данных&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Всемирный банк обычно получает данные от национальных статистических управлений (НСУ) напрямую. В некоторых случаях он использует данные НСУ, полученные косвенным путем. Подробнее об этом см. раздел по источникам данных.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Составители данных&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Всемирный банк&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Обоснование:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Мониторинг бедности имеет важное значение для глобальной повестки дня в области развития, также как и для национальной повестки дня в области развития во многих странах. Всемирный банк подготовил свои первые оценки глобальной нищеты в развивающихся странах для Доклада о мировом развитии за 1990 год: Бедность (Всемирный Банк, 1990 г.), используя данные обследования домашних хозяйств по 22 странам (Ravallion, Datt, and van de Walle 1991). С тех пор число стран, в которых проводятся обследования доходов и расходов домашних хозяйств, значительно возросло. Группа Всемирного банка по исследованиям в области развития ведет базу данных, которая ежегодно обновляется по мере поступления новых данных обследований (и, таким образом, может включать более свежие или пересмотренные данные), и каждый год проводит серьезную переоценку прогресса в деле борьбы с нищетой. PovcalNet представляет собой интерактивный вычислительный инструмент, который позволяет пользователям моделировать эти международно-сопоставимые оценки нищеты для уровней в 1,90 долл. США и 3,20 долл. США в день в глобальном, региональном и страновом разрезах, а также производить оценку нищеты для индивидуально отобранных групп стран и для различных уровней бедности.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Портал данных по бедности и равенству предоставляет доступ к базе данных и удобным для пользователя информационным панелям с графиками и интерактивными картами, которые визуализируют тенденции по ключевым показателям бедности и неравенства для различных регионов и стран. На страновых информационных панелях отображаются тенденции в оценках бедности, основанные на национальных уровнях бедности, наряду с международно-сопоставимыми оценками, составленными на основе данных из PovcalNet и совместимых с ними.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Комментарии и ограничения&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Пять стран - Бангладеш, Кабо-Верде, Камбоджа, Иордания и Лаос - используют коэффициенты пересчета на основе ППС 2005 года и соответствующие уровни бедности в 1,25 долл. США в день и 2 долл. США в день. Это связано с большими отклонениями в темпах изменения коэффициентов пересчета на основе ППС по сравнению с темпами изменения внутренних страновых индексов потребительских цен. См. вставку 1.1 в Докладе по вопросам глобального мониторинга за 2015/2016 годы &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-monitoring-report&quot;&gt;(Http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-monitoring-report)&lt;/a&gt; для более подробного объяснения.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Несмотря на прогресс, достигнутый за последнее десятилетие, проблемы измерения бедности остаются. Своевременность, частота, качество и сопоставимость данных обследований домашних хозяйств должны быть существенно повышены, особенно в самых бедных странах. Доступность и качество данных мониторинга бедности остается низким в небольших государствах, странах с нестабильным положением, странах с низким уровнем дохода и даже в некоторых странах со средним уровнем дохода. Низкая периодичность и недостаточная сопоставимость данных, имеющихся в некоторых странах, создают неопределенность в отношении масштабов сокращения бедности.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;При оценке уровня жизни домохозяйств возникают и другие проблемы качества данных, помимо периодичности и своевременности данных обследований. При проведении обследования задаются подробные вопросы об источниках доходов и о том, как они расходовались, которые должны быть тщательно зарегистрированы обученным персоналом. Доход, как правило, более сложно точно подсчитать, а потребление более приближено к понятию уровня жизни. К тому же доход может меняться с течением времени, но при этом уровень жизни может оставаться прежним. Однако данные по потреблению не всегда доступны: последние оценки, представленные здесь, используют данные по потреблению примерно для двух третей стран.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Тем не менее, даже похожие обследования не могут быть строго сопоставимыми из-за различий в сроках или в качестве, а также уровне подготовки переписчиков. Сравнения стран, находящихся на разных уровнях развития, также представляют потенциальную проблему из-за различий в относительной значимости потребления нерыночных товаров. Величина всего объема потребления в натуральной форме, выраженная в ценах местного рынка (включая собственное производство, что особенно важно для слаборазвитых экономик с сельскохозяйственным уклоном) должна быть включена в общие расходы на потребление, но она может быть и не включена. Большинство данных обследования в настоящее время включают оценки потребления или дохода от собственного производства, но методы их оценки различаются.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Методология&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Метод расчета:&lt;/h2&gt;
В целях оценки масштабов нищеты в различных странах Всемирный банк, при оценке международного уровня нищеты, использует общий стандарт, связанный с понятием « нищета» как оно трактуется в беднейших странах мира. Первоначальный уровень в размере 1 долл. США в день был рассчитан на основе национальных данных только для 22 развивающихся стран, главным образом на основе научных исследований 80 - х годов (Ravallion, et al., 1991). Несмотря на то, что в то время это было наилучшим вариантом, даже в 80 - е годы его можно было с трудом применить к развивающимся странам. С тех пор национальные уровни бедности были установлены для многих других стран. Основываясь на новой методике расчета национальных уровней для 75 развивающихся стран, Ravallion, Chen and Sangraula (RCS) (2009) предложили новый международный уровень нищеты в 1,25 долл. США в день. Это средний уровень нищеты для 15 беднейших стран в их наборах данных.
Нынешний уровень крайней бедности установлен в 1,90 долл. США в день по ППС в ценах 2011 года, что представляет собой среднее значение национальных уровней бедности, установленных в тех же 15 беднейших странах, ранжированных по уровню потребления на душу населения. Новая черта бедности сохраняет тот же стандарт крайней бедности - черту бедности, которая характерна для беднейших стран мира - но обновляет его, используя самую последнюю информацию о стоимости жизни в развивающихся странах. 
При оценке бедности страны с использованием международного уровня нищеты международная черта бедности по ППС конвертируется в местные валюты в ценах 2011 года, а затем конвертируется в цены, преобладающие на момент проведения соответствующего обследования домашних хозяйств, с использованием наилучшего доступного Индекса потребительских цен (ИПЦ). (Таким же образом данные обследования домохозяйств по потреблению или доходам в год проведения обследования выражаются в ценах базового года ИПЦ, а затем конвертируются в доллары по ППС). Затем по итогам этого обследования вычисляется уровень бедности. Все сравнения, проведенные внутри этого периода времени, являются реальными, так как они оцениваются с использованием ИПЦ для конкретной страны. Методы интерполяции/экстраполяции используются для выравнивания оценок, основанных на обследовании, с этими базисными годами.&lt;h2&gt;Обработка отсутствующих значений:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;На страновом уровне:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Не существует «вменения» в традиционном смысле для отсутствующих данных по стране. Однако для составления региональных и глобальных агрегированных показателей за отчетные годы данные на страновом уровне условно вменяются в те годы, когда обследования не проводились. Эти вмененные данные должны использоваться только для агрегирования, но не для замещения фактических данных обследования. В следующем разделе, посвященном обработке отсутствующих значений на региональном и глобальном уровнях, содержится более подробная информация о методе вменения.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;На региональном и глобальном уровнях:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Для сравнения уровней бедности по странам и расчета региональных агрегированных показателей страновые оценки должны быть сначала «приведены» к общему отчетному году с интерполяцией для стран, в которых данные обследования отсутствуют в отчетном году, но доступны либо до, либо после или имеется и то и другое. Чем больше имеется данных обследования (то есть, чем больше данных за разные годы), тем точнее интерполяция.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Процесс требует корректировки среднего дохода или расхода, наблюдаемого в год проведения обследования, с помощью коэффициента прироста для получения логического вывода о незарегистрированном уровне в базовом году. Таким образом, для реализации этого процесса необходимы два предположения: нейтрально-распределенный рост и реальный темп роста между годом обследования и отчетным годом.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Нейтрально-распределенный рост подразумевает, что уровни доходов или расходов корректируются с учетом роста, предполагая, что базовое относительное распределение доходов или расходов, наблюдаемое в годы обследования, остается неизменным. При таком допущении будет просто интерполировать оценку бедности в конкретном базовом году, исходя из заданных темпов роста доходов или расходов. Темпы изменения реального потребления на душу населения должны основываться на изменении реального потребления, оцененного путем сравнения страновых данных обследования за различные годы. На практике, однако, в большинстве стран отсутствуют данные обследования на ежегодной основе. Поэтому вместо этого используется изменение частного потребления на душу населения, оцененное по данным национальных счетов. Хотя не может быть никакой гарантии, что основанный на результатах обследования показатель дохода или потребления будет изменяться с той же скоростью, что и частное потребление по данным национальных счетов, но этот вариант представляется наилучшим из доступных.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Когда базовый год попадает между двумя обследуемыми годами, оценка среднего потребления в базовом году строится путем экстраполяции средних значений, полученных в результате обследований, проведенных до и после базового года. Вторым шагом является вычисление удельного веса бедных в общем населении в базовом году после нормализации распределений, полученных в двух годовых обследованиях, по среднему значению базового года. Это дает две оценки удельного веса бедных в общем населении в базовом году. Окончательный отчетный удельный вес бедных в общем населении за базовые годы представляет собой линейную интерполяцию двух значений. При наличии данных только за один год обследования среднее значение за базовый год основывается на среднем значении обследования путем применения темпов роста частного потребления на душу населения из национальных счетов. Оценка бедности за базовый год основывается на этом среднем значении и на распределении, наблюдаемом в одном годовом обследовании. Чем лучше охват данных с точки зрения количества и частоты доступных обследований, тем точнее будет процесс подбора искомого значения и тем более достоверными будут региональные оценки.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Совокупный удельный вес бедных в общем населении для региона является средневзвешенным значением удельных весов бедных в общем населении в странах этого региона. Число бедных в каждом регионе является произведением регионального индекса удельных весов бедных в общем населении и общей численности населения региона. Это предполагает, что уровень бедности для страны, не проводящей обследования домохозяйств, является средним по региону.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Региональные агрегаты&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Поскольку в большинстве стран обследования проводятся не каждый год, оценки бедности должны составляться по следующим друг за другом годам путем интерполяции или экстраполяции с использованием данных национальных счетов. Эти оценки по следующим друг за другом годам затем агрегируются в региональные и глобальные данные. Региональные и глобальные показатели являются средними значениями, взвешенными на численность населения.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Доступность данных&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Европа, Северная Америка, Австралия, Новая Зеландия и Япония: 20 (25 с учетом смоделированных оценок).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Источники расхождений&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Национальная бедность - это понятие, отличное от глобальной бедности. Национальный уровень бедности определяется по присущим странам уровням бедности, выраженным в местных валютах, которые в реальном выражении отличаются в разных странах и отличаются от международной черты бедности в 1,90 доллара США в день. Таким образом, национальные уровни бедности нельзя сопоставлять между странами или с уровнем бедности в 1,90 доллара США в день.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Ссылки&lt;/h1&gt;
