	<data>&lt;p&gt;The legal trade data are reported annually by Parties to CITES and stored in the CITES Trade Database, managed by the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre in Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detected illegal trade data have been gathered from a number of sources and combined in a UNODC database called &amp;#x201C;World WISE&amp;#x201D;. This database will be filled, from 2017, with data from the new annual CITES Illegal Trade reporting requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
