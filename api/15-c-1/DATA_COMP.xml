			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The value of a species-product unit is derived from the weighted average of prices declared for legal imports of analogous species product units, as acquired from United States Law Enforcement Monitoring and Information System of the Fish and Wildlife Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of legal trade is the sum of all species-product units documented in CITES export permits as reported in the CITES Annual Reports times the species-product unit prices as specified above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of illegal trade is the sum of all species-product units documented in the World WISE seizure database times the species-product unit prices as specified above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is value of illegal trade/(value of legal trade + value of illegal trade)&lt;/p&gt;
