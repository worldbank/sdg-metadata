Data is disaggregated by sex only. The CTS is confined to criminal courts, which include any legal body authorized to pronounce a conviction under national criminal law. Data on all levels of criminal courts is collected, but the survey does not disaggregate data to distinguish between judges in higher-level courts from those in lower-level courts. Data collection through the CTS is conducted on an annual basis. The most recent available data is for 2018.</li>\n  <li><strong><em>World Bank, Women, Business and the Law Report:<sup><a href=\"#footnote-18\" id=\"footnote-ref-18\">[17]</a></sup> </em></strong>The Women, Business and the Law Report includes data on the percentage of female judges and chief justices in constitutional courts for the 153 economies where constitutional courts exist.

The report also collects data on the percentage of female &#x2018;non-judge staff&#x2019; disaggregated by the <em>Rechtspfleger</em> function (or similar bodies) for 47 countries within Europe.
