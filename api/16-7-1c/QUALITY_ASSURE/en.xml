	<message>The QUALITY_ASSURE field for indicator 16-7-1c, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;It is recommended that NSOs serve as the main contact for reporting the necessary data on 16.7.1(c), in close coordination with relevant judicial bodies in the country such as the judicial services commission or the Ministry of Justice. This is to leverage and further consolidate the important quality assurance role played by NSOs in reviewing and &amp;#x2018;vetting&amp;#x2019; data produced by other parts of the national statistical system. It has been shown that official data sourced from NSOs tend to have more influence over policy analysis and decision-making at the national level compared to other sources that have not gone through the appropriate vetting and quality assurance processes managed by NSOs.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-16&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-16&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-16&quot;&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; UN Statistical Division, &lt;a href=&quot;https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/meetings/iaeg-sdgs-meeting-06/2017-10-04_CCSA%20Guiding%20Principles%20data%20flows.pdf&quot;&gt;Guiding Principles of Data Reporting and Data Sharing for the Global Monitoring of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development&lt;/a&gt; (2017). &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-16&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</data>
