&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization(s):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BirdLife International (BLI)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Concepts and definitions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator Proportion of important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity that are covered by protected areas shows temporal trends in the mean percentage of each important site for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity (i.e., those that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity) that is covered by designated protected areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concepts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protected areas, as defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN; Dudley 2008), are clearly defined geographical spaces, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values. Importantly, a variety of specific management objectives are recognised within this definition, spanning conservation, restoration, and sustainable use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Category Ia: Strict nature reserve&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Category Ib: Wilderness area&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Category II: National park&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Category III: Natural monument or feature&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Category IV: Habitat/species management area&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Category V: Protected landscape/seascape&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Category VI: Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The status &amp;quot;designated&amp;quot; is attributed to a protected area when the corresponding authority, according to national legislation or common practice (e.g., by means of an executive decree or the like), officially endorses a document of designation. The designation must be made for the purpose of biodiversity conservation, not de facto protection arising because of some other activity (e.g., military).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity are identified following globally criteria set out in &lt;em&gt;A Global Standard for the Identification of Key Biodiversity Areas &lt;/em&gt;(IUCN 2016) applied at national levels. Key Biodiversity Areas encompass (a) Important Bird &amp;amp; Biodiversity Areas, that is, sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, identified using data on birds, of which &amp;gt;13,000 sites in total have been identified from all of the world&amp;#x2019;s countries (BirdLife International 2014, Donald &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; 2018); (b) Alliance for Zero Extinction sites (Ricketts et al. 2005), that is, sites holding effectively the entire population of at least one species assessed as Critically Endangered or Endangered on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, of which 853 sites have been identified for 1,483 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, freshwater crustaceans, reef-building corals, conifers, cycads and other taxa; (c) Key Biodiversity Areas identified under an earlier version of the Key Biodiversity Area criteria (Langhammer &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; 2007), including those identified in Ecosystem Hotspot Profiles developed with support of the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund. These three subsets are being reassessed using the Global Standard, which unifies these approaches along with other mechanisms for identification of important sites for other species and ecosystems (IUCN 2016).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Data sources&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protected area data are compiled by ministries of environment and other ministries responsible for the designation and maintenance of protected areas. Protected Areas data for sites designated under the Ramsar Convention and the UNESCO World Heritage Convention are collected through the relevant convention international secretariats. Protected area data are aggregated globally into the World Database on Protected Areas by the UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre, according to the mandate for production of the United Nations List of Protected Areas (Deguignet et al. 2014). They are disseminated through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.protectedplanet.net/&quot;&gt;Protected Planet&lt;/a&gt;, which is jointly managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas (Juffe-Bignoli et al. 2014).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Biodiversity Areas are identified at national scales through multi-stakeholder processes, following standard criteria and thresholds. Key Biodiversity Areas data are aggregated into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/&quot;&gt;World Database on Key Biodiversity Areas&lt;/a&gt;, managed by BirdLife International. Specifically, data on Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are available online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/search&quot;&gt;http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/search&lt;/a&gt; and data on Alliance for Zero Extinction sites are available online at https://zeroextinction.org. Both datasets, along with Key Biodiversity Areas identified through other processes, are available through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/&quot;&gt;World Database on Key Biodiversity Areas&lt;/a&gt;, and, along with the World Database on Protected Areas, are also disseminated through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/login&quot;&gt;Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool for Research and Conservation Planning&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collection process:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See information under other sections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Calendar&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data collection:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNEP-WCMC produces the UN List of Protected Areas every 5&amp;#x2013;10 years, based on information provided by national ministries/agencies. In the intervening period between compilations of UN Lists, UNEP-WCMC works closely with national ministries/agencies and NGOs responsible for the designation and maintenance of protected areas, continually updating the WDPA as new data become available. The World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas is also updated on an ongoing basis, as new national data are submitted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data release:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator of protected area coverage of important sites for biodiversity is anticipated to be released annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Data providers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protected area data are compiled by ministries of environment and other ministries responsible for the designation and maintenance of protected areas. Key Biodiversity Areas are identified at national scales through multi-stakeholder processes, following standard criteria and thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Data compilers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNEP-WCMC and IUCN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protected area data are aggregated globally into the World Database on Protected Areas by the UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre, according to the mandate for production of the United Nations List of Protected Areas (Deguignet et al. 2014). They are disseminated through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.protectedplanet.net/&quot;&gt;Protected Planet&lt;/a&gt;, which is jointly managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC 2016). Key Biodiversity Areas data are aggregated into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/&quot;&gt;World Database on Key Biodiversity Areas&lt;/a&gt;, managed by BirdLife International (2019). Specifically, data on Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are available online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/search&quot;&gt;http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/search&lt;/a&gt; and data on Alliance for Zero Extinction sites are available online at https://zeroextinction.org. Both datasets, along with the World Database on Protected Areas, are also disseminated through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/login&quot;&gt;Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool for Research and Conservation Planning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rationale:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The safeguard of important sites is vital for stemming the decline in biodiversity and ensuring long term and sustainable use of terrestrial and freshwater natural resources. The establishment of protected areas is an important mechanism for achieving this aim, and this indicator serves as a means of measuring progress toward the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements. Importantly, while it can be disaggregated to report on any given single ecosystem of interest (e.g., forests), it is not restricted to any single ecosystem type, and so faithfully reflects the intent of SDG target 15.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levels of access to protected areas vary among the protected area management categories. Some areas, such as scientific reserves, are maintained in their natural state and closed to any other use. Others are used for recreation or tourism, or even open for the sustainable extraction of natural resources. In addition to protecting biodiversity, protected areas have high social and economic value: supporting local livelihoods; protecting watersheds from erosion; harbouring an untold wealth of genetic resources; supporting thriving recreation and tourism industries; providing for science, research and education; and forming a basis for cultural and other non-material values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator adds meaningful information to, complements and builds from traditionally reported simple statistics of terrestrial and freshwater area covered by protected areas, computed by dividing the total protected area within a country by the total territorial area of the country and multiplying by 100 (e.g., Chape et al. 2005). Such percentage area coverage statistics do not recognise the extreme variation of biodiversity importance over space (Rodrigues et al. 2004), and so risk generating perverse outcomes through the protection of areas which are large at the expense of those which require protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is used to track progress towards the 2011&amp;#x2013;2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014), and was used as an indicator towards the Convention on Biological Diversity&amp;#x2019;s 2010 Target (Butchart et al. 2010).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comments and limitations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality control criteria are applied to ensure consistency and comparability of the data in the World Database on Protected Areas. New data are validated at UNEP-WCMC through a number of tools and translated into the standard data structure of the World Database on Protected Areas. Discrepancies between the data in the World Database on Protected Areas and new data are minimised by provision of a manual (UNEP-WCMC 2019) and resolved in communication with data providers. Similar processes apply for the incorporation of data into the &lt;em&gt;World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas&lt;/em&gt; (BirdLife International 2019).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator does not measure the effectiveness of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss, which ultimately depends on a range of management and enforcement factors not covered by the indicator. A number of initiatives are underway to address this limitation. Most notably, numerous mechanisms have been developed for assessment of protected area management, which can be synthesised into an indicator (Leverington et al. 2010). This is used by the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership as a complementary indicator of progress towards Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement&quot;&gt;http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement&lt;/a&gt;). However, there may be little relationship between these measures and protected area outcomes (Nolte &amp;amp; Agrawal 2013). More recently, approaches to &amp;#x201C;green listing&amp;#x201D; have started to be developed, to incorporate both management effectiveness and the outcomes of protected areas, and these are likely to become progressively important as they are tested and applied more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data and knowledge gaps can arise due to difficulties in determining whether a site conforms to the IUCN definition of a protected area, and some protected areas are not assigned management categories. Moreover, &amp;#x201C;other effective area-based conservation measures&amp;#x201D;, as specified by Aichi Biodiversity Target &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011&amp;#x2013;2020, recognise that some sites beyond the formal protected area network, while not managed primarily for nature conservation, may nevertheless be managed in ways which are consistent with the persistence of the biodiversity for which they are important (Jonas et al. 2014). However, the formally agreed definition of an OECM (&amp;#x201C;A geographically defined area other than a Protected Area, which is governed and managed in ways that achieve positive and sustained long-term outcomes for the in situ conservation of biodiversity, with associated ecosystem functions and services and, where applicable, cultural, spiritual, socioeconomic, and other locally relevant values&amp;#x201D;) were only agreed in November 2018 and measures are only recently in place for countries to submit OECM data to UNEP-WCMC. OECMs are now collated by UNEP-WCMC in a separate database, the WD-OECM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding important sites, the biggest limitation is that site identification to date has focused mainly on specific subsets of biodiversity, for example birds (for Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas) and highly threatened species (for Alliance for Zero Extinction sites). While Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas have been documented to be good surrogates for biodiversity more generally (Brooks et al. 2001, Pain et al. 2005), the application of the unified standard for identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (IUCN 2016) sites across different levels of biodiversity (genes, species, ecosystems) and different taxonomic groups remains a high priority, building from efforts to date (Eken et al. 2004, Knight et al. 2007, Langhammer et al. 2007, Foster et al. 2012). Birds now comprise &amp;lt;50% of the species for which Key Biodiversity Areas have been identified, and as Key Biodiversity Area identification for other taxa and elements of biodiversity proceeds, such bias will become a less important consideration in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Biodiversity Area identification has been validated for a number of countries and regions where comprehensive biodiversity data allow formal calculation of the site importance (or &amp;#x201C;irreplaceability&amp;#x201D;) using systematic conservation planning techniques (Di Marco et al. 2016, Montesino Pouzols et al. 2014).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future developments of the indicator will include: a) expansion of the taxonomic coverage of terrestrial and freshwater Key Biodiversity Areas through application of the Key Biodiversity Areas standard (IUCN 2016) to a wide variety of terrestrial and freshwater vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and ecosystem type; b) improvements in the data on protected areas by continuing to increase the proportion of sites with documented dates of designation and with digitised boundary polygons (rather than coordinates).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Methodology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computation method:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator is calculated from data derived from a spatial overlap between digital polygons for protected areas from the World Database on Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC &amp;amp; IUCN 2020) and digital polygons for terrestrial and freshwater Key Biodiversity Areas (from the World Database of Key &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biodiversity Areas, including Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas, Alliance for Zero Extinction sites, and other Key Biodiversity Areas). Sites were classified as terrestrial Key Biodiversity Areas by undertaking a spatial overlap between the Key Biodiversity Area polygons and an ocean raster layer (produced from the &amp;#x2018;adm0&amp;#x2019; layer from the database of Global Administrative Areas (GADM 2019)), classifying any Key Biodiversity Area as a terrestrial Key Biodiversity Area where it had &amp;#x2264;95% overlap with the ocean layer (hence some sites were classified as both terrestrial and marine). Sites were classified as freshwater Key Biodiversity Areas if the resident species for which they were identified were documented in the IUCN Red List as dependent on &amp;#x2018;Inland Water&amp;#x2019; systems. For non-resident or migrant species, or species that shift habitats during the annual cycle, the site was tagged as freshwater if the species occurred at the site in the appropriate season of water-dependence (e.g. some species are only dependent on water during the breeding season). Sites were then screened (using the satellite imagery base layer within ArcGIS) as to whether they lay wholly in the Coastal Zone (defined here as within 10 km of the coast), and these sites were then untagged as Freshwater and instead tagged as Marine if the wetland habitats present at the site fell purely within the IUCN Habitat Classification Scheme class &amp;#x2018;Marine Supratidal&amp;#x2019; (i.e. estuaries, lagoons, etc.). If the site was within the Coastal Zone, but contained a mixture of Marine Supratidal and Inland Water classes, then it was tagged as both Freshwater and Marine. Each site was then manually cross-checked against other (less comprehensively available) site attributes, such as the habitat preferences of its trigger species, the site&amp;#x2019;s name (Delta, River, Humedal, etc.), its areal coverage by different habitat types, its overlap with Ramsar Sites, and its &amp;#x2018;shadow&amp;#x2019; Ramsar status, so as to confirm or remove the Freshwater tag appropriately. The value of the indicator at a given point in time, based on data on the year of protected area establishment recorded in the World Database on Protected Areas, is computed as the mean percentage of each Key Biodiversity Area currently recognised that it covered by protected areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Year of protected area establishment is unknown for ~12% of protected areas in the World Database on Protected Areas, generating uncertainty around changing protected area coverage over time. To reflect this uncertainty, a year was randomly assigned from another protected area within the same country, and then this procedure repeated 1,000 times, with the median plotted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to 2017, the indicator was presented as the percentage of Key Biodiversity Areas completely covered by protected areas. However, it is now presented as the mean % of each Key Biodiversity Area that is covered by protected areas in order to better reflect trends in protected area coverage for countries or regions with few or no Key Biodiversity Areas that are completely covered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment of missing values:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;At country level:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data are available for protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas in all of the world&amp;#x2019;s countries, and so no imputation or estimation of national level data is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;At regional and global levels:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global indicators of protected area coverage of important sites for biodiversity are calculated as the mean percentage of each Key Biodiversity Area that is covered by protected areas. The data are generated from all countries, and so while there is uncertainty around the data, there are no missing values as such and so no need for imputation or estimation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regional aggregates:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNEP-WCMC is the agency in charge of calculating and reporting global and regional figures for this indicator, working with BirdLife International and IUCN to combine data on protected areas with those for sites of importance for biodiversity. UNEP-WCMC aggregates the global and regional figures on protected areas from the national figures that are calculated from the World Database on Protected Areas and disseminated through Protected Planet. The World Database on Protected Areas and Protected Planet are jointly managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas. The World Database on Protected Areas is held within a Geographic Information System that stores information about protected areas such as their name, size, type, date of establishment, geographic location (point) and/or boundary (polygon). Protected area coverage is calculated using all the protected areas recorded in World Database on Protected Areas whose location and extent is known apart from protected areas without digital boundaries and those sites who have a status of &amp;#x2018;proposed&amp;#x2019; or &amp;#x2018;not reported&amp;#x2019;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WDPA has its origins in a 1959 UN mandate when the United Nations Economic and Social Council called for a list of national parks and equivalent reserves Resolution 713 (XXVIII). More details are available here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas&lt;/a&gt;. The UN List of Protected Areas has been published in 1961/62, 1966/71, 1972 (addendum to the 1966/71 edition), 1973, 1974, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1985, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2003, 2014 and 2018 which have resulted in a global network of national data providers for the WDPA. For example, in 2014 all Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) National Focal points and all National Focal points for the CBD Protected Areas Programme of Work (PoWPA) to request data for the 2014 Un List of Protected Areas (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas-2014&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas-2014&lt;/a&gt;). Protected areas data is therefore compiled directly from government agencies, regional hubs and other authoritative sources in the absence of a government source. All records have a unique metadata identifier (MetadataID) which links the spatial database to the Source table where all sources are described. The data is collated and standardised following the WDPA Data Standards and validated with the source. The process of collation, validation and publication of data as well as protocols and the WDPA data standards are regularly updated in the WDPA User Manual (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual&lt;/a&gt;) made available through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.protectedplanet.net&quot;&gt;www.protectedplanet.net&lt;/a&gt; where all spatial data and the Source table are also published every month and can be downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process for compilation of data on sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity (Key Biodiversity Areas) is documented online (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home&lt;/a&gt;). Specifically, (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/what-are-kbas&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/what-are-kbas&lt;/a&gt;), the Key Biodiversity Area identification process is a highly inclusive, consultative and bottom-up exercise. Although anyone with appropriate scientific data may propose a site to qualify as a Key Biodiversity Area, wide consultation with stakeholders at the national level (both non-governmental and governmental organizations) is required during the proposal process. Key Biodiversity Area identification builds off the existing network of Key Biodiversity Areas, including those identified as Important Bird &amp;amp; Biodiversity Areas through the BirdLife Partnership of 120 national organisations (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife-partners&quot;&gt;http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife-partners&lt;/a&gt;), for the Alliance for Zero Extinction by 93 national and international organisations (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html&quot;&gt;http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html&lt;/a&gt;), and as other Key Biodiversity Areas by civil society organisations supported by the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund in developing ecosystem profiles, named in each of the profiles listed here (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cepf.net/resources/publications/Pages/ecosystem_profiles.aspx&quot;&gt;http://www.cepf.net/resources/publications/Pages/ecosystem_profiles.aspx&lt;/a&gt;), with new data strengthening and expanding expand the network of these sites. Any site proposal undergoes independent scientific review. This is followed by the official site nomination with full documentation meeting the Documentation Standards for Key Biodiversity Areas. Sites confirmed by the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat to qualify as Key Biodiversity Areas then appear on the Key Biodiversity Areas website (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WDPA User Manual (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual&lt;/a&gt;) published in English, Spanish, and French provides guidance to countries on how to submit protected areas data to the WDPA, what are the benefits of providing such data, which are the data standards and which quality checks are performed. We also provide a summary of our methods to calculate protected areas coverage to all WDPA users: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/calculating-protected-area-coverage&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/calculating-protected-area-coverage&lt;/a&gt;. The &amp;#x201C;Global Standard for the Identification of Key Biodiversity Areas&amp;#x201D; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259&quot;&gt;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259&lt;/a&gt;) comprises the standard recommendations available to countries in the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas, with further guidelines available on the Key Biodiversity Areas website (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home&lt;/a&gt;). Specifically, (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved&lt;/a&gt;), the main steps of the Key Biodiversity Area identification process are the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;submission of Expressions of Intent to identify a Key Biodiversity Area to Regional Focal Points; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;proposal Development process, in which proposers compile relevant data and documentation and consult national experts, including organizations that have already identified Key Biodiversity Areas in the country, either through national Key Biodiversity Area Coordination Groups or independently; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;review of proposed Key Biodiversity Areas by Independent Expert Reviewers, verifying the accuracy of information within their area of expertise; and &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a Site Nomination phase comprising the submission of all the relevant documentation for verification by the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat (see section 3.3 below). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a Key Biodiversity Area is identified, monitoring of its qualifying features and its conservation status is important. Proposers, reviewers and those undertaking monitoring can join the Key Biodiversity Areas Community to exchange their experiences, case studies and best practice examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality assurance:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process on how the data is collected, standardised and published is available in the WDPA User Manual at: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual&lt;/a&gt; which is available in English, French and Spanish. Specific guidance is provided at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas&lt;/a&gt; on, for example, predefined fields or look up tables in the WDPA: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-lookup-tables&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-lookup-tables&lt;/a&gt;, how WDPA records are coded how international designations and regional designations data is collected, how regularly is the database updated, and how to perform protected areas coverage statistics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of identification of Key Biodiversity Areas is supported by the Key Biodiversity Areas Partnership (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/kba-partners&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/kba-partners&lt;/a&gt;). Among the roles of the partnership is establishment of the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat, which checks information submitted in the Site Nomination phase for the correct application of the Key Biodiversity Areas Standard ((&lt;a href=&quot;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259&quot;&gt;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259&lt;/a&gt;), and the adequacy of site documentation and then verifies the site, which is then published on the Key Biodiversity Areas Website (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved&lt;/a&gt;). In addition, the Chairs of the IUCN Species Survival Commission and World Commission on Protected Areas (both of whom are elected by the IUCN Membership of governments and non-governmental organisations), appoint the Chair of an independent Key Biodiversity Areas Standards and Appeals Committee, which ensures the correct application of the Global Standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas. The R code for calculating protected area coverage of Key Biodiversity Areas is documented as Dias, M. (2017) &amp;#x201C;R code for calculating protected area coverage of KBAs&amp;#x201D; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/userfiles/files/R_code_for_calculating_protected_area_coverage_of_KBAs_March_2017.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/userfiles/files/R_code_for_calculating_protected_area_coverage_of_KBAs_March_2017.pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to dissemination via the Protected Planet website (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/&lt;/a&gt;), the UN List process described in 3.1 the fact that protected areas data is collected from national agencies acknowledged in the WDPA metadata, and Key Biodiversity Areas website (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home&lt;/a&gt;), Protected Planet and Key Biodiversity Areas data are disseminated through the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool, available for research and conservation online (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/&quot;&gt;https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/&lt;/a&gt;). This incorporates Country Profile documents for all of the world&amp;#x2019;s countries, which includes documentation of the indicator of protected area coverage of Key Biodiversity Areas. Each annual update to these Country Profiles are sent for consultation to National Focal Points of the Convention on Biological Diversity (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml&quot;&gt;https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml&lt;/a&gt;), National Statistics Offices SDG Representatives and UN Permanent Missions (Geneva) representatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator has been classified by the IAEG-SDGs as Tier 1. Current data are available for all countries in the world, and these are updated on an ongoing basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~150 years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that data for the global indicator are compiled at national levels, it is straightforward to disaggregate to national and regional levels (e.g., Han et al. 2014), or conversely to aggregate to the global level. Key Biodiversity Areas span all ecosystem types, including marine (Edgar et al. 2008), freshwater (Holland et al. 2012), and mountains (Rodr&amp;#xED;guez-Rodr&amp;#xED;guez et al. 2011). The indicator can therefore be reported in combination across terrestrial and freshwater (and indeed marine) systems, or disaggregated among them. However, individual Key Biodiversity Areas can encompass terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems simultaneously, and so determining the results is not simply additive. Finally, the indicator can be disaggregated according to different protected area management categories (categories I&amp;#x2013;VI) to reflect differing specific management objectives of protected areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the aggregation of the coverage of protected areas across important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity as an indicator towards SDG 15.1, other disaggregations of coverage of protected areas of particular relevance as indicators towards SDG targets (Brooks et al. 2016) include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SDG 14.5.1 Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SDG 15.4.1 Coverage by protected areas of important sites for mountain biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protected area coverage data can be combined with other data sources to yield further, complementary, indicators. For example, protected area overlay with ecoregional maps can be used to provide information on protected area coverage of different broad biogeographical regions. Protected area coverage of the distributions of different groups of species (e.g., mammals, birds, amphibians) can similarly provide indicators of trends in coverage of biodiversity at the species level. Protected area coverage can be combined with the Red List Index to generate indicators of the impacts of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss (Butchart et al. 2012). Finally, indicators derived from protected area overlay can also inform sustainable urban development; for example, the overlay of protected areas onto urban maps could provide an indicator of public space as a proportion of overall city space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National processes provide the great bulk of the data that are subsequently aggregated into both the World Database on Protected Areas and the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, and so there are very few differences between national indicators and the global one. One minor source of difference is that the World Database on Protected Areas incorporates internationally-designated protected areas (e.g., UNESCO World Heritage sites, Ramsar sites, etc), a few of which are not considered by their sovereign nations to be protected areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that because countries do not submit comprehensive data on degazetted protected areas to the WDPA, earlier values of the indictor may marginally underestimate coverage. Furthermore, there is also a lag between the point at which a protected area is designated on the ground and the point at which it is reported to the WDPA. As such, current or recent coverage may also be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;References&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Les aires protégées, telles que définies par l&apos;Union internationale pour la conservation de la nature (UICN ; Dudley 2008), sont des espaces géographiques clairement définis, reconnus, dédiés et gérés, par des moyens légaux ou d&apos;autres moyens efficaces, afin de réaliser la conservation à long terme de la nature avec les services écosystémiques et les valeurs culturelles associés. Il est important de noter qu&apos;une variété d&apos;objectifs de gestion spécifiques sont reconnus dans cette définition, couvrant la conservation, la restauration et l&apos;utilisation durable :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Catégorie Ia : Réserve naturelle stricte &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Catégorie Ib : Zone de nature sauvage &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Catégorie II : Parc National&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Catégorie III : Monument ou élément naturel&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Catégorie IV : Zone de gestion de l&apos;habitat/des espèces&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Catégorie V : Paysage terrestre ou marin protégé &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Catégorie VI : Aire protégée avec utilisation durable des ressources naturelles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le statut &amp;quot;désigné&amp;quot; est attribué à une zone protégée lorsque l&apos;autorité correspondante, conformément à la législation nationale ou à la pratique courante (par exemple, au moyen d&apos;un décret exécutif ou autre), approuve officiellement un document de désignation. La désignation doit être faite dans un but de conservation de la biodiversité, et non de protection de facto résultant d&apos;une autre activité (par exemple, militaire).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les sites contribuant de manière significative à la persistance de la biodiversité à l&apos;échelle mondiale sont identifiés selon des critères globaux définis dans &lt;em&gt;Une norme mondiale pour l&apos;identification des zones clés pour la biodiversité &lt;/em&gt;(UICN 2016) appliqués au niveau national. Les zones clés pour la biodiversité comprennent (a) les zones importantes pour la biodiversité des oiseaux &amp;amp;, c&apos;est-à-dire les sites contribuant de manière significative à la persistance mondiale de la biodiversité, identifiés à l&apos;aide de données sur les oiseaux, dont &amp;gt;13 000 sites au total ont été identifiés dans tous les pays du monde&amp;#x2019;(BirdLife International 2014, Donald &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; 2018) ; (b) les sites de l&apos;Alliance pour une extinction zéro (Ricketts et al. 2005), c&apos;est-à-dire des sites détenant effectivement la totalité de la population d&apos;au moins une espèce évaluée comme étant en danger critique d&apos;extinction ou en danger sur la Liste rouge des espèces menacées de l&apos;UICN, dont 853 sites ont été identifiés pour 1 483 espèces de mammifères, d&apos;oiseaux, d&apos;amphibiens, de reptiles, de crustacés d&apos;eau douce, de coraux constructeurs de récifs, de conifères, de cycadales et d&apos;autres taxons ; (c) les zones clés pour la biodiversité identifiées selon une version antérieure des critères relatifs aux zones clés pour la biodiversité (Langhammer &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; 2007), y compris celles identifiées dans les profils de points chauds des écosystèmes élaborés avec le soutien du Fonds de partenariat pour les écosystèmes critiques. Ces trois sous-ensembles sont en cours de réévaluation à l&apos;aide de la Norme mondiale, qui unifie ces approches ainsi que d&apos;autres mécanismes d&apos;identification de sites importants pour d&apos;autres espèces et écosystèmes (UICN 2016).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Sources de données &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les données sur les aires protégées sont compilées par les ministères de l&apos;environnement et autres ministères responsables de la désignation et de l&apos;entretien des aires protégées. Les données sur les aires protégées pour les sites désignés dans le cadre de la Convention de Ramsar et de la Convention du patrimoine mondial de l&apos;UNESCO sont recueillies par les secrétariats internationaux des conventions concernées. Les données sur les aires protégées sont agrégées au niveau mondial dans la base de données mondiale sur les aires protégées par le Centre mondial de surveillance de la conservation de l&apos;environnement de l&apos;ONU, conformément au mandat de production de la liste des aires protégées de l&apos;ONU (Deguignet et al. 2014). Elles sont diffusées par le biais de &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.protectedplanet.net/&quot;&gt;Protected Planet&lt;/a&gt;, qui est géré conjointement par le PNUE-WCMC et l&apos;UICN et sa Commission mondiale des aires protégées (Juffe-Bignoli et al. 2014).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les zones clés pour la biodiversité sont identifiées à l&apos;échelle nationale par des processus multipartites, selon des critères et des seuils standard. Les données sur les zones clés pour la biodiversité sont regroupées dans la &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/&quot;&gt;Base de données mondiale sur les zones clés pour la biodiversité&lt;/a&gt;, gérée par BirdLife International. Plus précisément, les données sur les zones importantes pour les oiseaux et la biodiversité sont disponibles en ligne sur &lt;a href=&quot;http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/search&quot;&gt;http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/search&lt;/a&gt; et les données sur les sites de l&apos;Alliance pour une extinction zéro sont disponibles en ligne sur https://zeroextinction.org. Ces deux ensembles de données, ainsi que les zones clés pour la biodiversité identifiées par d&apos;autres processus, sont disponibles par le biais de la &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/&quot;&gt;Base de données mondiale sur les zones clés pour la biodiversité&lt;/a&gt; et, avec la base de données mondiale sur les zones protégées, sont également diffusés par le biais de l&apos;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/login&quot;&gt;Outil d&apos;évaluation intégrée de la biodiversité pour la recherche et la planification de la conservation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processus de collecte :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collecte des données :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le PNUE-WCMC produit la Liste des Nations Unies des aires protégées tous les 5 à 10 ans, sur la base des informations fournies par les ministères/agences nationales. Dans l&apos;intervalle entre les compilations des listes des Nations Unies, le PNUE-WCMC travaille en étroite collaboration avec les ministères/agences nationales et les ONG responsables de la désignation et de l&apos;entretien des zones protégées, mettant continuellement à jour la WDPA au fur et à mesure que de nouvelles données sont disponibles. La base de données mondiale des zones clés pour la biodiversité est également mise à jour de manière continue, au fur et à mesure que de nouvelles données nationales sont soumises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publication des données : &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il est prévu que l&apos;indicateur de la couverture en aires protégées des sites importants pour la biodiversité soit publié annuellement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Fournisseurs de données &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les données sur les zones protégées sont compilées par les ministères de l&apos;environnement et d&apos;autres ministères responsables de la désignation et de l&apos;entretien des zones protégées.

&lt;p&gt;PNUE-WCMC et UICN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les données sur les aires protégées sont agrégées au niveau mondial dans la base de données mondiale sur les aires protégées par le Centre mondial de surveillance continue de la conservation de la nature de l&apos;ONU Environnement, conformément au mandat de production de la liste des aires protégées de l&apos;ONU (Deguignet et al. 2014). Elles sont diffusées par le biais de &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.protectedplanet.net/&quot;&gt;Protected Planet&lt;/a&gt;, qui est géré conjointement par le PNUE-WCMC et l&apos;UICN et sa Commission mondiale des aires protégées (PNUE-WCMC 2016). Les données sur les zones clés pour la biodiversité sont regroupées dans la &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/&quot;&gt;Base de données mondiale sur les zones clés pour la biodiversité&lt;/a&gt;, gérée par BirdLife International (2019). Plus précisément, les données sur les zones importantes pour les oiseaux et la biodiversité sont disponibles en ligne sur &lt;a href=&quot;http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/search&quot;&gt;http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/search&lt;/a&gt; et les données sur les sites de l&apos;Alliance pour une extinction zéro sont disponibles en ligne sur https://zeroextinction.org. Ces deux ensembles de données, ainsi que la base de données mondiale sur les zones protégées, sont également diffusés par le biais de l&apos;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/login&quot;&gt;Outil d&apos;évaluation intégrée de la biodiversité pour la recherche et la planification de la conservation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justification :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La sauvegarde des sites importants est essentielle pour enrayer le déclin de la biodiversité et assurer une utilisation durable et à long terme des ressources naturelles terrestres et d&apos;eau douce. La création de zones protégées est un mécanisme important pour atteindre cet objectif, et cet indicateur sert à mesurer les progrès réalisés en matière de conservation, de restauration et d&apos;utilisation durable des écosystèmes terrestres et d&apos;eau douce et de leurs services, en particulier les forêts, les zones humides, les montagnes et les terres arides, conformément aux obligations découlant des accords internationaux. Il est important de noter que, bien qu&apos;il puisse être désagrégé pour rendre compte d&apos;un seul écosystème d&apos;intérêt (par exemple, les forêts), il n&apos;est pas limité à un seul type d&apos;écosystème, et reflète donc fidèlement l&apos;intention de la cible 15.1 des ODD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les niveaux d&apos;accès aux zones protégées varient selon les catégories de gestion des zones protégées. Certaines zones, comme les réserves scientifiques, sont maintenues dans leur état naturel et fermées à toute autre utilisation. D&apos;autres sont utilisées pour les loisirs ou le tourisme, ou même ouvertes à l&apos;extraction durable des ressources naturelles. Outre la protection de la biodiversité, les zones protégées ont une grande valeur sociale et économique : elles soutiennent les moyens de subsistance locaux, protègent les bassins versants de l&apos;érosion, abritent une richesse inestimable de ressources génétiques, soutiennent des industries florissantes de loisirs et de tourisme, permettent la science, la recherche et l&apos;éducation, et constituent une base pour les valeurs culturelles et autres valeurs non matérielles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Cet indicateur ajoute des informations significatives aux statistiques simples traditionnellement rapportées sur la superficie terrestre et d&apos;eau douce couverte par les aires protégées, en divisant la superficie totale protégée dans un pays par la superficie territoriale totale du pays et en multipliant par 100 (par exemple, Chape et al. 2005). Ces statistiques de couverture de zone en pourcentage ne reconnaissent pas l&apos;extrême variation de l&apos;importance de la biodiversité dans l&apos;espace (Rodrigues et al. 2004), et risquent donc de générer des résultats pervers par la protection des zones qui sont grandes au détriment de celles qui nécessitent une protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L&apos;indicateur est utilisé pour suivre les progrès vers le Plan stratégique 2011 à 2020 pour la biodiversité (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014), et a été utilisé comme indicateur pour l&apos;Objectif 2010 de la Convention sur la diversité biologique (Butchart et al. 2010).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commentaires et limites : &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Des critères de contrôle de qualité sont appliqués pour assurer la cohérence et la comparabilité des données de la Base de données mondiale sur les aires protégées. Les nouvelles données sont validées au PNUE-WCMC par le biais d&apos;un certain nombre d&apos;outils et traduites dans la structure de données standard de la Base de données mondiale sur les aires protégées. Les divergences entre les données de la base de données mondiale sur les aires protégées et les nouvelles données sont réduites au minimum grâce à un manuel (UNEP-WCMC 2019) et résolues en communiquant avec les fournisseurs de données. Des processus similaires s&apos;appliquent à l&apos;incorporation de données dans la &lt;em&gt;Base de données mondiale des zones clés pour la biodiversité&lt;/em&gt; (BirdLife International 2019).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L&apos;indicateur ne mesure pas l&apos;efficacité des zones protégées à réduire la perte de biodiversité, qui dépend en fin de compte d&apos;une série de facteurs de gestion et d&apos;application non couverts par l&apos;indicateur. Un certain nombre d&apos;initiatives sont en cours pour remédier à cette limitation. Plus particulièrement, de nombreux mécanismes ont été développés pour évaluer la gestion des aires protégées, qui peuvent être synthétisés dans un indicateur (Leverington et al. 2010). Ce dernier est utilisé par le Partenariat pour les indicateurs de la biodiversité comme un indicateur complémentaire des progrès accomplis vers l&apos;Objectif 11 d&apos;Aichi pour la biodiversité. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement&quot;&gt;http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement&lt;/a&gt;). Cependant, il peut y avoir peu de relation entre ces mesures et les résultats des aires protégées (Nolte &amp;amp; Agrawal 2013). Plus récemment, des approches de la &amp;#x201C;liste verte&amp;#x201D; ont commencé à être développées, afin d&apos;incorporer à la fois l&apos;efficacité de la gestion et les résultats des aires protégées, et celles-ci sont susceptibles de devenir progressivement importantes au fur et à mesure qu&apos;elles sont testées et appliquées plus largement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Des lacunes dans les données et les connaissances peuvent survenir en raison des difficultés à déterminer si un site est conforme à la définition de l&apos;UICN d&apos;une aire protégée, et certaines aires protégées ne se voient pas attribuer de catégories de gestion. En outre, &amp;#x201C;d&apos;autres mesures efficaces de conservation par zone&amp;#x201D;, telles que spécifiées par l&apos;Objectif d&apos;Aichi pour la biodiversité.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 du Plan stratégique pour la biodiversité 2011 à 2020, reconnaissent que certains sites situés au-delà du réseau officiel d&apos;aires protégées, bien que n&apos;étant pas gérés principalement pour la conservation de la nature, peuvent néanmoins être gérés de manière à assurer la persistance de la biodiversité pour laquelle ils sont importants (Jonas et al. 2014). Cependant, la définition officiellement convenue d&apos;une OECM (&amp;#x201C;Une zone géographiquement définie autre qu&apos;une aire protégée, qui est gouvernée et gérée de manière à obtenir des résultats positifs et durables à long terme pour la conservation in situ de la biodiversité, avec les fonctions et services écosystémiques associés et, le cas échéant, les valeurs culturelles, spirituelles, socio-économiques et autres valeurs pertinentes au niveau local&amp;#x201D;) n&apos;a été convenue qu&apos;en novembre 2018 et les mesures ne sont que récemment en place pour que les pays soumettent les données des OECM au PNUE-WCMC. Les OECM sont désormais rassemblées par le PNUE-WCMC dans une base de données distincte, la WD-OECM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En ce qui concerne les sites importants, la plus grande limitation est que l&apos;identification des sites à ce jour s&apos;est principalement concentrée sur des sous-ensembles spécifiques de la biodiversité, par exemple les oiseaux (pour les zones importantes pour les oiseaux et la biodiversité) et les espèces hautement menacées (pour les sites de l&apos;Alliance pour une extinction zéro). Bien qu&apos;il ait été démontré que les zones importantes pour la conservation des oiseaux et de la biodiversité sont de bons substituts de la biodiversité en général (Brooks et al. 2001, Pain et al. 2005), l&apos;application de la norme unifiée pour l&apos;identification des sites des zones clés pour la biodiversité (UICN 2016) à différents niveaux de biodiversité (gènes, espèces, écosystèmes) et à différents groupes taxonomiques reste une grande priorité, sur la base des efforts déployés à ce jour (Eken et al. 2004, Knight et al. 2007, Langhammer et al. 2007, Foster et al. 2012). Les oiseaux représentent désormais &amp;lt;50 % des espèces pour lesquelles des zones clés pour la biodiversité ont été identifiées et, à mesure que l&apos;identification de zones clés pour la biodiversité pour d&apos;autres taxons et éléments de la biodiversité progresse, ce biais deviendra une considération moins importante à l&apos;avenir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L&apos;identification des zones clés pour la biodiversité a été validée pour un certain nombre de pays et de régions où des données complètes sur la biodiversité permettent un calcul formel de l&apos;importance du site (ou de son &amp;#x201C;irremplaçabilité&amp;#x201D;) à l&apos;aide de techniques systématiques de planification de la conservation (Di Marco et al. 2016, Montesino Pouzols et al. 2014).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les développements futurs de l&apos;indicateur comprendront : a) l&apos;expansion de la couverture taxonomique des zones clés pour la biodiversité terrestres et d&apos;eau douce par l&apos;application de la norme des zones clés pour la biodiversité (UICN 2016) à une grande variété de vertébrés, d&apos;invertébrés et de plantes terrestres et d&apos;eau douce, ainsi qu&apos;à un type d&apos;écosystème ; b) l&apos;amélioration des données sur les zones protégées en continuant à augmenter la proportion de sites dont les dates de désignation sont documentées et dont les polygones de délimitation sont numérisés (plutôt que des coordonnées).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Méthodologie &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Méthode de calcul :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cet indicateur est calculé à partir de données dérivées d&apos;un chevauchement spatial entre les polygones numériques des aires protégées de la base de données mondiale sur les aires protégées (PNUE-WCMC &amp;amp; UICN 2020) et les polygones numériques des zones clés pour la biodiversité terrestres et d&apos;eau douce (de la Base de données mondiale des zones clés pour la biodiversité&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zones clés pour la biodiversité, y compris les zones importantes pour les oiseaux et la biodiversité, les sites de l&apos;Alliance pour une extinction zéro et d&apos;autres zones clés pour la biodiversité). Les sites ont été classés comme zones clés pour la biodiversité terrestres en effectuant un chevauchement spatial entre les polygones des zones clés pour la biodiversité et une couche matricielle océanique (produite à partir de la couche &amp;#x2018;adm0&amp;#x2019; de la base de données des zones administratives mondiales (GADM 2019)), en classant toute zone clé pour la biodiversité comme zone clé pour la biodiversité terrestre lorsqu&apos;elle présente un chevauchement de &amp;#x2264;95 % avec la couche océanique (certains sites ont donc été classés comme étant à la fois terrestres et marins). Les sites ont été classés comme zones clés pour la biodiversité d&apos;eau douce si les espèces résidentes pour lesquelles ils ont été identifiés étaient documentées dans la liste rouge de l&apos;UICN comme dépendant des systèmes d&apos;eaux intérieures. Pour les espèces non résidentes ou migrantes, ou les espèces qui changent d&apos;habitat au cours du cycle annuel, le site a été étiqueté comme étant d&apos;eau douce si l&apos;espèce était présente sur le site pendant la saison appropriée de dépendance à l&apos;eau (par exemple, certaines espèces ne dépendent de l&apos;eau que pendant la saison de reproduction). Les sites ont ensuite été examinés (à l&apos;aide de la couche de base de l&apos;imagerie satellite dans ArcGIS) pour déterminer s&apos;ils se trouvaient entièrement dans la zone côtière (définie ici comme étant à moins de 10 km de la côte), et ces sites n&apos;ont pas été étiquetés comme étant d&apos;eau douce, mais comme étant marins si les habitats de zones humides présents sur le site relevaient uniquement de la classe &amp;#x2018;Marine Supratidal&amp;#x2019; du système de classification des habitats de l&apos;UICN (c&apos;est-à-dire les estuaires, les lagunes, etc.). Si le site se trouvait dans la zone côtière, mais contenait un mélange de classes d&apos;eaux supratidales marines et d&apos;eaux intérieures, il a été étiqueté à la fois comme eau douce et marine. Chaque site a ensuite fait l&apos;objet d&apos;une vérification croisée manuelle par rapport à d&apos;autres attributs de site (disponibles de manière moins exhaustive), tels que les préférences d&apos;habitat de ses espèces déclencheuses, le nom du site (Delta, Rivière, Humedal, etc.), sa couverture en superficie par différents types d&apos;habitats, son chevauchement avec des sites Ramsar et son statut Ramsar fantôme, de manière à confirmer ou à supprimer l&apos;étiquette Eau douce de manière appropriée. La valeur de l&apos;indicateur à un moment donné, basée sur les données relatives à l&apos;année d&apos;établissement de l&apos;aire protégée enregistrées dans la Base de données mondiale sur les aires protégées, est calculée comme le pourcentage moyen de chaque zone clé pour la biodiversité actuellement reconnue qu&apos;elle couvre par des aires protégées.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L&apos;année d&apos;établissement des aires protégées est inconnue pour ~12% des aires protégées de la base de données mondiale sur les aires protégées, ce qui génère une incertitude quant à l&apos;évolution de la couverture des aires protégées au fil du temps. Pour refléter cette incertitude, une année a été assignée au hasard à partir d&apos;une autre aire protégée dans le même pays, puis cette procédure a été répétée 1 000 fois, avec la médiane tracée. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avant 2017, l&apos;indicateur était présenté comme le pourcentage de zones clés pour la biodiversité entièrement couvertes par des zones protégées. Cependant, il est maintenant présenté comme le % moyen de chaque zone clé pour la biodiversité qui est couverte par des zones protégées afin de mieux refléter les tendances de la couverture des zones protégées pour les pays ou les régions avec peu ou pas de zones clés pour la biodiversité qui sont complètement couvertes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traitement des valeurs manquantes : &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Au niveau national : &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les données sont disponibles pour les zones protégées et les zones clés pour la biodiversité dans tous les pays du monde et donc aucune imputation ou estimation des données au niveau national n&apos;est nécessaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aux niveaux régional et mondial :&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les indicateurs mondiaux de la couverture par les aires protégées des sites importants pour la biodiversité sont calculés comme le pourcentage moyen de chaque zone clé pour la biodiversité qui est couverte par des aires protégées. Les données sont générées à partir de tous les pays, et donc, bien qu&apos;il y ait une incertitude autour des données, il n&apos;y a pas de valeurs manquantes en tant que telles et il n&apos;y a donc pas besoin d&apos;imputation ou d&apos;estimation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agrégats régionaux :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le PNUE-WCMC est l&apos;agence chargée de calculer et de communiquer les chiffres mondiaux et régionaux pour cet indicateur, en collaboration avec BirdLife International et l&apos;UICN pour combiner les données sur les aires protégées avec celles des sites importants pour la biodiversité. Le PNUE-WCMC regroupe les chiffres mondiaux et régionaux sur les zones protégées à partir des chiffres nationaux calculés à partir de la base de données mondiale sur les zones protégées et diffusés par Protected Planet. La base de données mondiale sur les aires protégées et Protected Planet sont gérées conjointement par le PNUE-WCMC, l&apos;UICN et sa Commission mondiale des aires protégées. La base de données mondiale sur les aires protégées est conservée dans un système d&apos;information géographique qui stocke des informations sur les aires protégées telles que leur nom, leur taille, leur type, leur date de création, leur emplacement géographique (point) et/ou leurs limites (polygone). La couverture des aires protégées est calculée en utilisant toutes les aires protégées enregistrées dans la base de données mondiale sur les aires protégées dont l&apos;emplacement et l&apos;étendue sont connus, à l&apos;exception des aires protégées sans limites numériques et des sites dont le statut est &amp;#x2018;proposé&amp;#x2019; ou &amp;#x2018;non signalé&amp;#x2019;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Méthodes et instructions à la disposition des pays pour la compilation des données au niveau national :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La WDPA trouve son origine dans un mandat des Nations Unies de 1959, lorsque le Conseil économique et social des Nations Unies a demandé une liste de parcs nationaux et de réserves équivalentes (Résolution 713 (XXVIII)). Plus de détails sont disponibles ici : &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas&lt;/a&gt;. La liste des aires protégées des Nations Unies a été publiée en 1961/62, 1966/71, 1972 (addendum à l&apos;édition 1966/71), 1973, 1974, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1985, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2003, 2014 et 2018, ce qui a donné lieu à un réseau mondial de fournisseurs de données nationales pour la WDPA. Par exemple, en 2014, tous les points focaux nationaux de la Convention sur la diversité biologique (CDB) et tous les points focaux nationaux du programme de travail sur les aires protégées de la CDB (PoWPA) ont demandé des données pour la liste de 2014 dess aires protégées des Nations Unies (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas-2014&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas-2014&lt;/a&gt;). Les données sur les aires protégées sont donc compilées directement à partir d&apos;agences gouvernementales, de centres régionaux et d&apos;autres sources faisant autorité en l&apos;absence de source gouvernementale. Tous les enregistrements ont un identifiant de métadonnées unique (MetadataID) qui relie la base de données spatiale à la table Source où toutes les sources sont décrites. Les données sont rassemblées et standardisées selon les normes de données de la WDPA et validées avec la source. Le processus de collecte, de validation et de publication des données ainsi que les protocoles et les normes de données de la WDPA sont régulièrement mis à jour dans le manuel de l&apos;utilisateur de la WDPA (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual&lt;/a&gt;) disponible sur &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.protectedplanet.net&quot;&gt;www.protectedplanet.net&lt;/a&gt; où toutes les données spatiales et le tableau des sources sont également publiés chaque mois et peuvent être téléchargés.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le processus de compilation des données sur les sites contribuant de manière significative à la persistance de la biodiversité mondiale (zones clés pour la biodiversité) est documenté en ligne (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home&lt;/a&gt;). Plus précisément, (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/what-are-kbas&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/what-are-kbas&lt;/a&gt;), le processus d&apos;identification des zones clés pour la biodiversité est un exercice très inclusif, consultatif et ascendant. Bien que toute personne disposant de données scientifiques appropriées puisse proposer un site à qualifier de zone clé pour la biodiversité, une large consultation des parties prenantes au niveau national (organisations non gouvernementales et gouvernementales) est requise au cours du processus de proposition. L&apos;identification des zones clés pour la biodiversité s&apos;appuie sur le réseau existant de zones clés pour la biodiversité, y compris celles identifiées comme zones importantes pour la biodiversité des oiseaux par le partenariat BirdLife de 120 organisations nationales (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife-partners&quot;&gt;http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife-partners&lt;/a&gt;), pour l&apos;Alliance pour une extinction zéro par 93 organisations nationales et internationales (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html&quot;&gt;http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html&lt;/a&gt;), et en tant qu&apos;autres zones clés pour la biodiversité par des organisations de la société civile soutenues par le Fonds de partenariat pour les écosystèmes critiques dans l&apos;élaboration de profils d&apos;écosystèmes, nommés dans chacun des profils énumérés ici (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cepf.net/resources/publications/Pages/ecosystem_profiles.aspx&quot;&gt;http://www.cepf.net/resources/publications/Pages/ecosystem_profiles.aspx&lt;/a&gt;), les nouvelles données renforçant et élargissant le réseau de ces sites. Toute proposition de site fait l&apos;objet d&apos;un examen scientifique indépendant. Il s&apos;ensuit la nomination officielle du site avec une documentation complète répondant aux normes de documentation des zones clés pour la biodiversité. Les sites dont le Secrétariat des zones clés pour la biodiversité confirme qu&apos;ils remplissent les conditions requises pour devenir des zones clés pour la biodiversité apparaissent ensuite sur le site Web des zones clés pour la biodiversité (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le manuel de l&apos;utilisateur de la WDPA (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual&lt;/a&gt;) publié en anglais, en espagnol et en français, fournit des conseils aux pays sur la manière de soumettre des données sur les zones protégées à la WDPA, sur les avantages de fournir ces données, sur les normes de données et sur les contrôles de qualité effectués. Nous fournissons également un résumé de nos méthodes de calcul de la couverture des zones protégées à tous les utilisateurs de la WDPA : &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/calculating-protected-area-coverage&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/calculating-protected-area-coverage&lt;/a&gt;. La &amp;#x201C;Norme mondiale pour l&apos;identification des zones clés pour la biodiversité&amp;#x201D; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259&quot;&gt;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259&lt;/a&gt;) comprend les recommandations standard mises à la disposition des pays pour l&apos;identification des zones clés pour la biodiversité, d&apos;autres directives étant disponibles sur le site Web des zones clés pour la biodiversité (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home&lt;/a&gt;). Plus précisément, (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved&lt;/a&gt;), les principales étapes du processus d&apos;identification des zones clés pour la biodiversité sont les suivantes : &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;soumission des expressions d&apos;intention d&apos;identifier une Zone de Biodiversité Clé aux Points Focaux Régionaux ; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;processus d&apos;élaboration de la proposition, au cours duquel les proposants compilent les données et la documentation pertinentes et consultent des experts nationaux, y compris des organisations qui ont déjà identifié des zones clés pour la biodiversité dans le pays, soit par l&apos;intermédiaire de groupes nationaux de coordination des zones clés pour la biodiversité, soit de manière indépendante ; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;l&apos;examen des zones clés pour la biodiversité proposées par des experts indépendants, qui vérifient l&apos;exactitude des informations dans leur domaine d&apos;expertise ; et &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;une phase de désignation des sites comprenant la soumission de tous les documents pertinents pour vérification par le secrétariat des zones clés pour la biodiversité (voir section 3.3 ci-dessous). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Une fois qu&apos;une zone clé pour la biodiversité est identifiée, il est important de surveiller ses caractéristiques et son état de conservation. Les auteurs de propositions, les réviseurs et les personnes chargées de la surveillance peuvent rejoindre la communauté des zones clés pour la biodiversité afin d&apos;échanger leurs expériences, leurs études de cas et leurs exemples de meilleures pratiques. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assurance de la qualité :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le processus de collecte, de normalisation et de publication des données est disponible dans le manuel d&apos;utilisation de la WDPA à l&apos;adresse suivante : &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual&lt;/a&gt; qui est disponible en anglais, français et espagnol. Des conseils spécifiques sont fournis à l&apos;adresse &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas&lt;/a&gt; sur, par exemple, les champs prédéfinis ou les tables de recherche dans la WDPA : &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-lookup-tables&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-lookup-tables&lt;/a&gt;, comment les enregistrements de la WDPA sont codés, comment les données sur les désignations internationales et régionales sont collectées, à quelle fréquence la base de données est mise à jour et comment réaliser des statistiques sur la couverture des zones protégées. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le processus d&apos;identification des zones clés pour la biodiversité est soutenu par le partenariat des zones clés pour la biodiversité (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/kba-partners&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/kba-partners&lt;/a&gt;). Parmi les rôles du partenariat figure la mise en place du Secrétariat des zones clés pour la biodiversité, qui vérifie les informations soumises lors de la phase de désignation des sites pour s&apos;assurer de l&apos;application correcte de la norme relative aux zones clés pour la biodiversité (&lt;a href=&quot;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259&quot;&gt;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259&lt;/a&gt;), et de l&apos;adéquation de la documentation du site, puis vérifie le site, qui est ensuite publié sur le site Web des zones clés pour la biodiversité (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved&lt;/a&gt;). En outre, les présidents de la Commission de la sauvegarde des espèces de l’UICN et de la Commission mondiale des aires protégées (qui sont tous deux élus par les membres de l’UICN des gouvernements et des organisations non gouvernementales) nomment le président d’un Comité indépendant des normes et d’appels des zones clés de biodiversité, qui assure l’application correcte de la Norme mondiale pour l’identification des zones clés de biodiversité. Le code R pour le calcul de la couverture des zones protégées des zones clés pour la biodiversité est documenté comme Dias, M. (2017) &amp;#x201C;Code R pour le calcul de la couverture des zones protégées des ZCB&amp;#x201D; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/userfiles/files/R_code_for_calculating_protected_area_coverage_of_KBAs_March_2017.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/userfiles/files/R_code_for_calculating_protected_area_coverage_of_KBAs_March_2017.pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outre la diffusion via le site Web de Protected Planet (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/&lt;/a&gt;), le processus de la liste des Nations Unies décrit au point 3.1, le fait que les données sur les aires protégées sont collectées auprès d&apos;organismes nationaux reconnus dans les métadonnées de la WDPA, et le site Web des zones clés pour la biodiversité (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home&lt;/a&gt;), les données de Protected Planet et des zones clés pour la biodiversité sont diffusées via l&apos;outil d&apos;évaluation intégrée de la biodiversité, disponible en ligne pour la recherche et la conservation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/&quot;&gt;https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/&lt;/a&gt;). Cet outil intègre les profils nationaux de tous les pays du monde, qui comprennent une documentation sur l&apos;indicateur de couverture des zones protégées des zones clés pour la biodiversité. Chaque mise à jour annuelle de ces profils nationaux est envoyée pour consultation aux points focaux nationaux de la Convention sur la diversité biologique (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml&quot;&gt;https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml&lt;/a&gt;), aux représentants des OMD des bureaux nationaux de statistiques et aux représentants des missions permanentes des Nations Unies (Genève.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Disponibilité des données &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cet indicateur a été classé par l’IAEG-ODD comme étant de niveau 1. Des données actuelles sont disponibles pour tous les pays du monde, et elles sont mises à jour en permanence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Séries chronologiques :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~150 ans&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Désaggrégation :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Étant donné que les données pour l&apos;indicateur mondial sont compilées au niveau national, il est facile de désagréger aux niveaux national et régional (par exemple, Han et al. 2014), ou inversement d&apos;agréger au niveau mondial. Les zones clés pour la biodiversité couvrent tous les types d&apos;écosystèmes, y compris les milieux marins (Edgar et al. 2008), les eaux douces (Holland et al. 2012) et les montagnes (Rodr&amp;#xED;guez-Rodr&amp;#xED;guez et al. 2011). L&apos;indicateur peut donc être rapporté en combinaison dans les systèmes terrestres et d&apos;eau douce (et même marins), ou désagrégé entre eux. Cependant, les zones clés pour la biodiversité individuelles peuvent englober simultanément des systèmes terrestres, d&apos;eau douce et marins, et la détermination des résultats n&apos;est donc pas simplement additive. Enfin, l&apos;indicateur peut être désagrégé selon les différentes catégories de gestion des aires protégées (catégories I à VI) pour refléter les différents objectifs de gestion spécifiques des aires protégées.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;En plus de l&apos;agrégation de la couverture des aires protégées à travers les sites importants pour la biodiversité terrestre et d&apos;eau douce en tant qu&apos;indicateur de l&apos;ODD 15.1, d&apos;autres désagrégations de la couverture des aires protégées particulièrement pertinentes en tant qu&apos;indicateurs des cibles des ODD (Brooks et al. 2016) comprennent :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O DD14.5.1 Couverture des zones protégées par rapport aux zones marines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ODD 15.4.1 Couverture par les aires protégées des sites importants pour la biodiversité des montagnes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les données sur la couverture des zones protégées peuvent être combinées avec d&apos;autres sources de données pour produire d&apos;autres indicateurs complémentaires. Par exemple, la superposition des aires protégées avec des cartes écorégionales peut être utilisée pour fournir des informations sur la couverture par les aires protégées de différentes grandes régions biogéographiques. La couverture par les aires protégées des distributions de différents groupes d&apos;espèces (par exemple, les mammifères, les oiseaux, les amphibiens) peut également fournir des indicateurs des tendances de la couverture de la biodiversité au niveau des espèces. La couverture des zones protégées peut être combinée avec l&apos;indice de la liste rouge pour générer des indicateurs de l&apos;impact des zones protégées sur la réduction de la perte de biodiversité (Butchart et al. 2012). Enfin, les indicateurs dérivés de la superposition des zones protégées peuvent également informer le développement urbain durable ; par exemple, la superposition des zones protégées sur les cartes urbaines pourrait fournir un indicateur de l&apos;espace public en tant que proportion de l&apos;espace global de la ville.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources des écarts :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les processus nationaux fournissent la grande majorité des données qui sont ensuite agrégées dans la Base de données mondiale sur les aires protégées et la Base de données mondiale sur les zones clés pour la biodiversité, et il y a donc très peu de différences entre les indicateurs nationaux et l&apos;indicateur mondial. Une source mineure de différence est que la Base de données mondiale sur les aires protégées incorpore les aires protégées désignées au niveau international (par exemple, les sites du patrimoine mondial de l&apos;UNESCO, les sites Ramsar, etc), dont quelques-unes ne sont pas considérées par leurs nations souveraines comme des aires protégées.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notez que parce que les pays ne soumettent pas de données complètes sur les aires protégées déclassées à la WDPA, les valeurs antérieures de l&apos;indicateur peuvent marginalement sous-estimer la couverture. En outre, il y a également un décalage entre le moment où une zone protégée est désignée sur le terrain et le moment où elle est signalée à la WDPA. Ainsi, la couverture actuelle ou récente peut également être sous-estimée.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Références &lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Международный союз охраны природы (МСОП) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Понятия и определения &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Определение:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Показатель Доля важных с точки зрения биологического разнообразия районов суши и пресноводных районов, находящихся под охраной, показывает временные тенденции в средней процентной доле каждого важного с точки зрения биологического разнообразия района суши и пресноводного района (т. е. тех, которые вносят значительный вклад в глобальное сохранение биоразнообразия), которые охвачены уполномоченными охраняемыми территориями.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Понятия:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Охраняемые территории, как это определено Международным союзом охраны природы (IUCN; Dudley 2008), представляют собой четко определенные географические пространства, признанные, выделенные и управляемые с помощью юридических или других эффективных средств для достижения долгосрочного сохранения природы с соответствующими экосистемными услугами и культурными ценностями. Важно отметить, что в рамках этого определения признается ряд конкретных управленческих ориентиров, охватывающих сохранение, восстановление и рациональное использование:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Категория Ia: Полный заповедник &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Категория Ib: Район дикой природы &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Категория II: Национальный парк &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Категория III: Памятник природы или природный объект &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Категория IV: Управляемая территория для защиты определенных видов или мест обитания &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Категория V: Защищенный ландшафт / морской пейзаж &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Категория VI: Защищенная территория с рациональным использованием природных ресурсов &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Статус &quot;уполномочен&quot; присваивается охраняемой территории, когда соответствующий орган в соответствии с национальным законодательством или общепринятой практикой (например, посредством исполнительного указа и т.п.) официально подписывает документ о наделении полномочиями. Наделение полномочиями должно быть сделано с целью сохранения биоразнообразия, а не фактической защиты, возникающей из-за угрозы какой-либо другой деятельности (например, военной).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Участки, вносящие значительный вклад в сохранение биоразнообразия во всем мире, определяются в соответствии с глобальными критериями, изложенными в &lt;em&gt; Глобальном стандарте для определения ключевых территорий сохранения биоразнообразия &lt;/em&gt; (МСОП, 2016 г.), применяемом на национальном уровне. Ключевые территории сохранения биоразнообразия включают в себя: (a) Ключевые территории сохранения орнитологического биоразнообразия, то есть участки, вносящие значительный вклад в глобальную устойчивость биоразнообразия, относящиеся к использованию данных по птицам, из которых в общей сложности было идентифицировано более 13000 участков во всех странах мира (BirdLife International 2014, Donald &lt;em&gt; et al. &lt;/em&gt; 2018); (b) Участки Альянса за предотвращение полного исчезновения (Рикеттс и др., 2005), то есть участки, на которых фактически обитает вся имеющаяся в наличии популяция по крайней мере какого-либо одного вида, признанного находящимся под угрозой исчезновения или включенного в Красную книгу МСОП видов, находящихся под угрозой исчезновения, из которых 853 участка были определены для 1483 видов млекопитающих, птиц, амфибий, рептилий, пресноводных ракообразных, рифообразующих кораллов, хвойных деревьев, саговников и других таксонов; (c) Ключевые районы сохранения биоразнообразия, определенные в соответствии с более ранней версией критериев ключевых районов сохранения биоразнообразия (Langhammer &lt;em&gt; et al. &lt;/em&gt; 2007), включая те, которые определены в Профилях экосистемных горячих точек, разработанных при поддержке Фонда партнерства по критическим экосистемам. Эти три подгруппы переоцениваются с использованием Глобального стандарта, который объединяет эти подходы вместе с другими механизмами для определения важных участков для других видов и экосистем (МСОП 2016).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Источники данных &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Описание: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Данные по охраняемым территориям составляются министерствами окружающей среды и другими министерствами, ответственными за наделение полномочиями и содержание охраняемых территорий. Данные по охраняемым территориям для объектов, обозначенных в соответствии с Рамсарской конвенцией и Конвенцией всемирного наследия ЮНЕСКО, собираются через соответствующие международные секретариаты конвенций. Данные по охраняемым территориям, агрегированные на глобальном уровне, загружаются во Всемирную базу данных по охраняемым территориям Всемирным центром мониторинга охраны природы ООН в соответствии с полномочиями по составлению Списка охраняемых территорий Организации Объединенных Наций (Deguignet et al. 2014). Они распространяются через &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.protectedplanet.net/&quot;&gt; визуальный интерфейс Защищенная планета &lt;/a&gt;, которым совместно управляют Программа ООН по окружающей среде - Всемирный центр мониторинга охраны природы ООН (UNEP-WCMC) и Международный союз охраны природы (МСОП), а также входящая в него Всемирная комиссия по охраняемым территориям (Juffe-Bignoli et al. 2014).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ключевые территории сохранения биоразнообразия определяются в национальном масштабе в ходе процессов с участием многих заинтересованных сторон, следуя стандартным критериям и пороговым значениям. Данные по ключевым территориям сохранения биоразнообразия объединены во всемирную базу данных ключевых территорий сохранения биоразнообразия, расположенную по адресу &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/&quot;&gt;,

&lt;p&gt; Программа ООН по окружающей среде - Всемирный центр мониторинга охраны природы ООН (UNEP-WCMC) составляет Список ООН по охраняемым территориям каждые 5-10 лет на основе информации, предоставляемой национальными министерствами / агентствами. В период между составлением Списков Программа ООН по окружающей среде - Всемирный центр мониторинга охраны природы ООН (UNEP-WCMC) тесно сотрудничает с национальными министерствами / агентствами и неправительственными организациями (НПО), ответственными за наделение полномочиями и поддержание охраняемых территорий, постоянно обновляя Всемирную базу данных по охраняемым территориям по мере появления новых данных. Всемирная база данных по ключевым территориям сохранения биоразнообразия также постоянно обновляется по мере поступления новых национальных данных. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Выпуск данных:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Данные по охраняемым территориям на глобальном уровне агрегируются во Всемирную базу данных по охраняемым территориям Программой ООН по окружающей среде - Всемирным центром мониторинга охраны природы (UNEP-WCMC) в соответствии с полномочиями по составлению Списка ООН по охраняемым территориям (Deguignet et al. 2014).

В частности, данные по важным орнитологическим территориям и территориям сохранения биоразнообразия доступны в Интернете по адресу &lt;a href=&quot;http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/search&quot;&gt;http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/search&lt;/a&gt;, а данные по территориям Альянса за предотвращение полного исчезновения доступны в Интернете по адресу &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zeroextinction.org/search.cfm&quot;&gt; http://www.zeroextinction.org/search.cfm &lt;/a&gt;. Оба набора данных вместе со Всемирной базой данных по охраняемым территориям также распространяются через &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/login&quot;&gt;Инструмент комплексной оценки биоразнообразия для исследований и планирования мероприятий по сохранению биоразнообразия&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; Обоснование:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Охрана важных объектов имеет жизненно важное значение для сдерживания сокращения биоразнообразия и обеспечения долгосрочного и устойчивого использования наземных и пресноводных природных ресурсов. Создание охраняемых районов является важным механизмом достижения этой цели и этот показатель служит средством оценки прогресса в деле сохранения, восстановления и устойчивого использования наземных и пресноводных экосистем и их услуг, в частности лесов, водно-болотных угодий, гор и засушливых районов в соответствии с обязательствами по международным соглашениям. Важно отметить, что, несмотря на то, что показатель может быть дезагрегирован для отчетности по любой конкретной представляющей интерес экосистеме (например, леса), он не ограничивается каким-либо одним типом экосистемы и таким образом точно отражает цель 15.1 ЦУР. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Уровни доступа к охраняемым территориям различаются в зависимости от категорий управления охраняемыми территориями. Некоторые территории, такие как научные заповедники, поддерживаются в естественном состоянии и закрыты для любого иного использования. Другие территории используются для отдыха или туризма или даже открыты для устойчивой добычи природных ресурсов. Помимо защиты биоразнообразия, охраняемые территории имеют большое социальное и экономическое значение: они обеспечивают средства существования местного населения; поддерживают рыболовство; предоставляют укрытие неисчислимым богатствам генетических ресурсов; поддерживают процветающую индустрию отдыха и туризма; приносят пользу науке, исследованиям и образованию; и создают основы для культурных и других нематериальных ценностей.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Этот показатель привносит значимую информацию, дополняет и строится на основе традиционно представленных простых статистических данных по наземным и пресноводным территориям, охваченным охраняемыми районами, и вычисляется путем деления общей площади охраняемой территории в стране на общую площадь территории страны и последующего умножения на 100 (например, Chape et al. 2005). Такое статистическое понимание охвата территорий в процентном выражении не учитывает крайних вариаций важности защиты биоразнообразия в пространственном измерении (Rodrigues et al. 2004), и, таким образом, есть риск получить неблагоприятные результаты вследствие проведения мероприятий по защите территорий, площадь которых больше, чем необходимо, за счет тех, кому защита необходима.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Показатель применяется для отражения прогресса в достижении Стратегического плана в области сохранения и устойчивого использования биоразнообразия на 2011–2020 гг. (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al., 2014), а также использовался в качестве показателя достижения Цели Конвенции 2010 года по защите биологического разнообразия (Butchart et al. 2010). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; Комментарии и ограничения:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Критерии контроля качества применяются для обеспечения согласованности и сопоставимости данных во Всемирной базе данных по охраняемым территориям. Новые данные подвергаются валидации в Программе ООН по окружающей среде - Всемирном центре мониторинга охраны природы ООН (UNEP-WCMC) с помощью ряда инструментов и переводятся в стандартную структуру данных Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям. Расхождения между данными Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям и новыми данными сводятся к минимуму с помощью руководства (UNEP-WCMC 2019) и устраняются при общении с поставщиками данных. Аналогичные процессы применяются при включении данных во &lt;em&gt; Всемирную базу данных по ключевым территориям сохранения биоразнообразия &lt;/em&gt; (BirdLife International 2019). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Показатель не отражает эффективность мер на охраняемых территориях с точки зрения сокращения потерь в биоразнообразии, что в итоге зависит от ряда факторов управления и обеспечения исполнения, не охватываемых показателем. В настоящее время проводится ряд мероприятий по устранению этого ограничения. В частности, для оценки управления охраняемыми территориями были разработаны многочисленные механизмы, которые можно синтезировать в показателе (Leverington et al. 2010). Он используется Партнерством по показателям сохранения биоразнообразия в качестве дополнительного показателя прогресса в достижении Цели 11 по сохранению биоразнообразия, упомянутой в Айтинских целевых задачах в области биоразнообразия (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement&quot;&gt;http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement&lt;/a&gt;). Однако связь между этими оценками и результатами деятельности на охраняемых территориях может быть не очень явной (Nolte &amp;amp; Agrawal 2013). Совсем недавно начали разрабатываться подходы к &amp;#x201C; Зеленому списку &amp;#x201D;, чтобы учитывать такие факторы, как эффективность управления и результаты деятельности на охраняемых территориях, и они, вероятно, будут становиться все более важными после их тестирования и начала более широкого применения.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Пробелы в данных и знаниях могут возникать из-за трудностей с определением того, соответствует ли участок определению охраняемой территории МСОП, а некоторым охраняемым территориям не присвоены категории управления. Более того, &amp;#x201C; другие эффективные природоохранные меры, основанные на территориальном подходе &amp;#x201D;, и, как указано в целевой задаче 11 Айтинских целевых задач в области биоразнообразия Стратегического плана по сохранению и устойчивому использованию биоразнообразия на 2011-2013 гг., признают, что некоторые участки за пределами официальной сети охраняемых территорий, хотя и не управляются изначально с целью сохранения природы, тем не менее, их можно регулировать способами, которые соответствуют политике сохранения биоразнообразия, для которой они являются важными (Jonas et al. 2014). Тем не менее, официально согласованные определения OECM - инициативы &quot;Другая эффективная мера по сохранению биоразнообразия, основанная на территориальном подходе&quot; (&amp;#x201C; географически определенная территория, отличная от охраняемой территории, которая регулируется и управляется таким образом, чтобы достичь положительных и устойчивых долгосрочных результатов для сохранения биоразнообразия на местном уровне, с соответствующими экосистемными функциями и услугами, а также, где это применимо, культурными, духовными, социально-экономическими и другими значимыми на местном уровне ценностными ориентирами &amp;#x201D;) были согласованы только в ноябре 2018 года, а меры по предоставлению странами данных ОЕСМ в UNEP-WCMC приняты совсем недавно. В настоящее время OECM сопоставляются Программой ООН по окружающей среде - Всемирным центром мониторинга охраны природы ООН (UNEP-WCMC) в отдельной базе данных, Всемирной базе данных инициативы &quot;Другая эффективная мера по сохранению биоразнообразия, основанная на территориальном подходе&quot; (WD-OECM). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Что касается важных участков, то самым большим ограничением является то, что идентификация участков на сегодняшний день сосредоточена в основном на конкретных подмножествах биоразнообразия, например, птицах (для важных территорий орнитологического и иного биоразнообразия) и видах, находящихся под угрозой исчезновения (для территорий Альянса за предотвращение полного исчезновения). В то время как важные территории для орнитологического и иного биоразнообразия были задокументированы как подходящие заменители биоразнообразия в целом (Brooks et al. 2001, Pain et al. 2005), применение единого стандарта для определения ключевых территорий биоразнообразия (IUCN 2016) на разных уровнях биоразнообразия (гены, виды, экосистемы) и различных таксономических группах остается высокоприоритетной задачей, исходя из предпринятых на сегодняшний день усилиях (Eken et al. 2004, Knight et al. 2007, Langhammer et al. 2007, Foster et al. 2012). В настоящее время птицы составляют &amp;lt; 50% видов, для которых были определены ключевые районы биоразнообразия, и по мере того, как происходит идентификация ключевых районов биоразнообразия для других таксонов и элементов биоразнообразия, такой крен в будущем сократится. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Идентификация ключевых территорий сохранения биоразнообразия была подтверждена для ряда стран и регионов, где исчерпывающие данные по биоразнообразию позволяют формально рассчитать важность (или «незаменимость») с использованием методов систематического природоохранного планирования (Di Marco et al., 2016, Montesino Pouzols et al.2014).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Дальнейшие разработки показателя будут включать: a) расширение таксономического охвата ключевых территорий сохранения наземного и пресноводного биоразнообразия путем применения стандарта для ключевых районов биоразнообразия (МСОП 2016) к широкому спектру наземных и пресноводных позвоночных, беспозвоночных, растений и типов экосистем; б) улучшение данных по охраняемым территориям за счет продолжения процесса по увеличению доли участков с задокументированными датами назначения полномочий и с полигонами, имеющими оцифрованные границы (а не координаты).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Методология &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; Метод расчета: &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Этот показатель рассчитывается на основе данных, полученных в результате взаимного пространственного перекрытия оцифрованных полигонов для охраняемых территорий из Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям (Программа ООН по окружающей среде - Всемирный центр мониторинга охраны природы ООН (UNEP-WCMC), Международный союз охраны природы (IUCN 2020)) и оцифрованных полигонов для наземных и пресноводных ключевых районов сохранения биоразнообразия (из Всемирной базы данных по ключевым территориям сохранения биоразнообразия, включая ключевые территории сохранения орнитологического биоразнообразия, территории Альянса за предотвращение полного исчезновения и другие ключевые районы сохранения биоразнообразия). Участки были классифицированы как наземные ключевые районы сохранения биоразнообразия путем пространственного перекрытия полигонов ключевого района сохранения биоразнообразия и растрового слоя океана (полученного из слоя &amp;#x2018; adm0 &amp;#x2019; из базы данных глобальных административных районов (GADM 2019), классифицируя любой ключевой район сохранения биоразнообразия как наземный ключевой район сохранения биоразнообразия, если он на 95% перекрывается со слоем океана (следовательно, некоторые участки были классифицированы как наземные и морские). Участки были классифицированы как пресноводные ключевые районы сохранения биоразнообразия, если обитающие в них виды, для которых они были определены, были внесены в Красный список МСОП как зависящие от системы &amp;#x2018; внутренних вод &amp;#x2019;. Для нерезидентов или мигрирующих видов или видов, которые меняют среду обитания в течение годового цикла, участок был помечен как пресноводный, если вид встречался на участке в соответствующий сезон водной зависимости (например, некоторые виды зависят от воды только в течение сезона размножения). Затем участки были проверены (с использованием базового слоя спутниковых снимков в системе ArcGIS) на предмет того, полностью ли они находятся в прибрежной зоне (определяемой здесь как зона, расположенная в пределах 10 км от побережья), и эти участки затем были исключены из помеченных как пресноводные и вместо этого помечены как морские, если ареалы водно-болотных угодий, представленные на этом участке, полностью подпадали под классификационную схему МСОП «Морской надприливный» класс (т. е. эстуарии, лагуны и т. д.). Если участок находился в прибрежной зоне, но содержал смесь классов морского надприливного и внутренних вод, то он был помечен как пресноводный, так и морской. Затем каждый участок был вручную перепроверен по другим (менее доступным) атрибутам участка, таким как предпочтительная среда обитания его триггерных видов, обозначение участка (Дельта, Река, Водно-болотные угодья и т. д.), площадь его покрытия различными экотипами, его взаимное перекрытие с Рамсарскими угодьями и его теневым статусом Рамсарской конвенции, чтобы надлежащим образом подтвердить или удалить метку принадлежности к пресноводным. Значение показателя в определенный момент времени, основанное на данных по дате основания охраняемой территории, зарегистрированной во Всемирной базе данных по охраняемым территориям, рассчитывается как среднее значение, выраженное в процентах, каждой ключевой территории сохранения биоразнообразия, признанной в настоящее время охваченной охраняемыми территориями.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Год создания охраняемых территорий неизвестен для ~ 12% охраняемых территорий во Всемирной базе данных по охраняемым территориям, что порождает неопределенность в отношении изменения охвата охраняемыми территориями с течением времени. Чтобы отразить эту неопределенность, случайным образом был заимствован год от другой охраняемой территории в той же стране, а затем эта процедура была повторена 1000 раз с медианным отображением.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; До 2017 года показатель представлялся как процентная доля ключевых территорий сохранения биоразнообразия, полностью охваченных охраняемыми территориями. Однако теперь он представлен как среднее процентное значение каждой ключевой территории сохранения биоразнообразия, охваченной охраняемыми территориями, чтобы лучше отразить тенденции в охвате охраняемыми территориями для стран или регионов с небольшим числом полностью охваченных ключевых территорий сохранения биоразнообразия или вообще их не имеющих. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; Обработка отсутствующих значений: &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt; На страновом уровне: &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Данные доступны по охраняемым территориям и ключевым территориям сохранения биоразнообразия во всех странах мира, поэтому вменение или оценка данных на национальном уровне не требуется. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt; На региональном и глобальном уровнях: &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Глобальные показатели охвата охраняемыми территориями участков, важных для сохранения биоразнообразия, рассчитываются как среднее процентное значение по каждой ключевой территории сохранения биоразнообразия, охваченной охраняемыми территориями. Данные получены от всех стран, поэтому, несмотря на неопределенность в отношении данных, отсутствующих значений нет как таковых, и поэтому нет необходимости во вменении или оценке значений.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; Региональные агрегаты: &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Программа ООН по окружающей среде - Всемирный центр мониторинга охраны природы UNEP-WCMC) является агентством, отвечающим за расчет и представление глобальных и региональных показателей по этому показателю, работающим совместно с Международной ассоциацией по защите птиц (BLI) и Международным союзом охраны природы (МСОП) над объединением данных по охраняемым территориям с данными по районам, важным для сохранения биоразнообразия. UNEP-WCMC агрегирует глобальные и региональные данные по охраняемым территориям из национальных данных, которые берутся для расчета из Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям и распространяются через визуальный интерфейс Защищенная планета. Всемирная база данных по охраняемым территориям и Защищенная планета совместно управляются Программой ООН по окружающей среде - Всемирным центром мониторинга охраны природы (UNEP-WCMC) и Международным союзом охраны природы (МСОП), а также входящей в него Всемирной комиссией по охраняемым территориям. Всемирная база данных по охраняемым территориям находится в Географической информационной системе, в которой хранится такая информация по охраняемым территориям, как их название, размер, тип, дата создания, географическое месторасположение (точка) и / или граница (полигон). Охват охраняемых территорий рассчитывается с использованием информации обо всех охраняемых территориях, зарегистрированных во Всемирной базе данных по охраняемым территориям, расположение и протяженность которых известны, за исключением охраняемых территорий без оцифрованных границ и тех участков, которые имеют статус &quot;предлагаемых&quot; или &quot;по которым нет отчетности&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Доступные странам методы и руководства для составления данных на национальном уровне: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Всемирная база данных по охраняемым территориям (WDPA) берет свое начало с мандата ООН 1959 года, когда Экономический и Социальный Совет ООН в резолюции 713 (XXVIII) призвал составить Список национальных парков и эквивалентных заповедников. Более подробная информация доступна здесь: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas&quot;&gt; https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas&lt;/a&gt;. Список охраняемых территорий ООН был опубликован в 1961/62, 1966/71, 1972 годах (приложение к изданию 1966/71), 1973, 1974, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1985, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2003, 2014 и 2018 годов, в результате чего была создана глобальная сеть национальных поставщиков данных для Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям (ВБДОТ). Например, в 2014 году все национальные координационные центры Конвенции о биологическом разнообразии (КБР) и все национальные координационные центры Программы работы по Конвенции о биологическом разнообразии по охраняемым территориям (PoWPA) запрашивали данные для Списка ООН по охраняемым территориям 2014 года &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas-2014&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas-2014&lt;/a&gt;). Таким образом, данные по охраняемым территориям собираются непосредственно от правительственных органов, региональных центров и других авторитетных источников в отсутствие государственного источника. Все отчеты имеют уникальный идентификатор метаданных (MetadataID), который связывает пространственную базу данных с исходной таблицей, в которой описаны все источники. Данные сопоставляются и приводятся в стандартизируемую форму в соответствии со стандартами данных ВБДОТ и проходят процесс валидации с источником. Процесс сопоставления, валидации и публикации данных, а также протоколы и стандарты данных ВБДОТ регулярно обновляются в Руководстве пользователя ВБДОТ (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual&lt;/a&gt;) доступном по адресу &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.protectedplanet.net&quot;&gt;www.protectedplanet.net&lt;/a&gt;, где все пространственные данные и исходная таблица также публикуются каждый месяц и могут быть выгружены.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Процесс составления данных по площадкам, вносящим значительный вклад в сохранение биоразнообразия во всем мире (Ключевые территории сохранения биоразнообразия), задокументирован в Интернете (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home&quot;&gt;http: //www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home&lt;/a&gt;). В частности, (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/what-are-kbas&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/what-are-kbas&lt;/a&gt;) процесс идентификации ключевой территории сохранения биоразнообразия - это очень всеохватный, консультативный и восходящий вертикально-интегрированный процесс. Хотя любой человек, располагающий соответствующими научными данными, может предложить организовать участок, который квалифицируется как ключевой район сохранения биоразнообразия, в процессе подачи заявки необходимо провести широкие консультации с заинтересованными сторонами на национальном уровне (как неправительственными, так и правительственными организациями). Определение ключевых районов сохранения биоразнообразия основывается на существующей сети ключевых районов сохранения биоразнообразия, в том числе тех, которые определены с помощью 120 национальных организаций Партнерства по защите птиц как ключевые территории сохранения орнитологического биоразнообразия (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife-partners&quot;&gt;http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife -partners&lt;/a&gt;), 93 национальными и международными организациями Альянса за предотвращение полного исчезновения (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html&quot;&gt;http://www.zeroextinction.org /partners.html&lt;/a&gt;), а также в других ключевых областях сохранения биоразнообразия организациями гражданского общества при поддержке Фонда партнерства критических экосистем в разработке профилей экосистем, названных в каждом из перечисленных здесь профилей (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cepf.net/resources/publications/Pages/ecosystem_profiles.aspx&quot;&gt;http://www.cepf.net/resources/publications/Pages/ecosystem_profiles.aspx&lt;/a&gt;), с новым усилением и расширением данных, увеличивающих сеть этих участков. Любое предложение организации участка проходит независимую научную экспертизу. Затем следует официальная номинация участка с представлением полного пакета документации, соответствующей Стандартам по документации для ключевых областей сохранения биоразнообразия. Участки, подтвержденные Секретариатом ключевых районов сохранения биоразнообразия в качестве ключевых районов сохранения биоразнообразия, затем появляются на веб-сайте ключевых районов сохранения биоразнообразия (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Руководство пользователя Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual&lt;/a&gt;) опубликованное на английском, испанском и французском языках, содержит рекомендации для стран по таким вопросам, как порядок представления данные по охраняемым территориям во Всемирную базу данных по охраняемым территориям, какие имеются преимущества при предоставлении таких данных, каковы стандарты данных и какие проверки качества выполняются. Мы также предоставляем краткое изложение наших методов расчета охвата охраняемых территорий для всех пользователей Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/calculating-protected-area-coverage&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/calculating-protected-area-coverage&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#x201C; Глобальный стандарт определения ключевых областей сохранения биоразнообразия &amp;#x201D; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259&quot;&gt;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259&lt;/a&gt;) содержит стандартные рекомендации, доступные странам в определении ключевых областей сохранения биоразнообразия, с дополнительными руководящими указаниями, доступными на веб-сайте ключевых областей биоразнообразия (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home&lt;/a&gt;). В частности (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved&lt;/a&gt;), основные этапы процесса определения ключевого района биоразнообразия следующие: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;представление заявлений региональным координационным центрам о намерениях определить ключевую область сохранения биоразнообразия; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; процесс разработки предложения, в ходе которого заявители собирают соответствующие данные и документацию и консультируются с национальными экспертами, включая организации, которые уже определяли ключевые области сохранения биоразнообразия в стране, либо через национальные координационные группы по ключевым областям сохранения биоразнообразия, либо независимо; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; рассмотрение предлагаемых ключевых областей сохранения биоразнообразия независимыми экспертами-рецензентами с верификацией точности информации в пределах их компетенции; и &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; этап номинирования участка, включающий представление всей соответствующей документации для проверки Секретариатом ключевых территорий сохранения биоразнообразия (см. раздел 3.3 ниже). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; После определения ключевого района сохранения биоразнообразия становится важным организация мониторинга квалифицирующих его характеристик и статуса сохранения. Авторы предложений, рецензенты и те, кто проводит мониторинг, могут присоединиться к Сообществу по ключевым областям сохранения биоразнообразия, чтобы обмениваться своим опытом, результатами тематических исследований и примерами передовой практики.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; Обеспечение качества: &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Процесс сбора, стандартизации и публикации данных доступен в Руководстве пользователя Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям по адресу: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manua &lt;/a&gt;, которое опубликовано на английском, французском и испанском языках. Конкретные инструкции представлены на странице &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-area&lt;/a&gt;, например, в регламентных полях или в таблицах во Всемирной базе данных по охраняемым территориям: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-lookup-tables&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-lookup-tables&lt;/a&gt; как кодируются отчеты Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям, как собираются данные о международных и региональных обозначениях, как регулярно обновляется база данных и как представлять статистику охвата охраняемых территорий.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Процесс определения ключевых районов биоразнообразия поддерживается Партнерством по ключевым районам биоразнообразия (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/kba-partners&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/kba-partners&lt;/a&gt;). Среди ролей партнерства - создание Секретариата по ключевым областям биоразнообразия, который проверяет информацию, представленную на этапе предложения участков, на предмет правильности применения стандарта ключевых областей биоразнообразия (&lt;a href=&quot;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259&quot;&gt;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259&lt;/a&gt;), а также на соответствие документации участка, а затем проверяет участок, информация о котором затем публикуется на веб-сайте ключевых областей биоразнообразия (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved&lt;/a&gt;). Кроме того, председатели Комиссии МСОП по выживанию видов и Всемирной комиссии по охраняемым территориям (оба избираются членами МСОП, входящими в состав правительств и неправительственных организаций), назначают председателя независимого Комитета по стандартам и апелляциям в отношении ключевых территорий биоразнообразия, что обеспечивает правильное применение Глобального стандарта для определения ключевых областей биоразнообразия. Код R для расчета охвата охраняемых территорий ключевых территорий биоразнообразия задокументирован как Dias, M. (2017) &amp;#x201C; Код R для расчета охвата охраняемых территорий КРБ &amp;#x201D; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/userfiles/files/R_code_for_calculating_protected_area_coverage_of_KBAs_March_2017.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/userfiles/files/R_code_for_calculating_protected_area_coverage_of_KBAs_March_2017.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Помимо распространения через веб-сайт Защищенная планета (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectedplanet.net/&quot;&gt;https://www.protectedplanet.net &lt;/a&gt;), процесс составления Списка ООН разъясняет в п. 3.1 тот факт, что данные по охраняемым территориям собираются от национальных агентств, которые названы в метаданных Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям, и на веб-сайте ключевых территорий сохранения биоразнообразия (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home&lt;/a&gt;), данных визуального интерфейса Защищенная планета и данных по ключевым территориям сохранения биоразнообразия, которые распространяются с помощью Инструмента интегрированной оценки биоразнообразия, доступного для исследования и сохранения в Интернете (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/&quot;&gt;https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/&lt;/a&gt;). Он включает документы странового профиля для всех стран мира, в котором содержится документация по показателю охвата охраняемых территорий ключевых территорий сохранения биоразнообразия. Каждое ежегодное обновление этих страновых профилей направляется для консультаций национальным координаторам Конвенции о биологическом разнообразии (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml&quot;&gt;https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml&lt;/a&gt;), представителям национальных статистических управлений по ЦУР и представителям постоянных представительств ООН (Женева).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Доступность данных &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; Описание: &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Этот показатель был отнесен Межучрежденческой и экспертной группой по показателям достижения целей в области устойчивого развития (МЭГ-ЦУР) к Уровню 1. Текущие данные доступны по всем странам мира и они постоянно обновляются. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; Временные ряды: &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ~ 150 лет &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; Дезагрегирование: &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Учитывая, что данные для глобального показателя составляются на национальном уровне, их легко дезагрегировать до национального и регионального уровней (например, Han et al., 2014) или, наоборот, агрегировать до глобального уровня. Ключевые районы сохранения биоразнообразия охватывают все типы экосистем, включая морские (Edgar et al. 2008), пресноводные (Holland et al. 2012) и горные (Rodr&amp;#xED;guez-Rodr&amp;#xED;guez et al. 2011). Таким образом, показатель может быть представлен в комбинации по наземным и пресноводным (и даже морским) системам или в разбивке по ним. Однако отдельные ключевые районы сохранения биоразнообразия могут охватывать одновременно наземные, пресноводные и морские системы, поэтому определение результатов не является простым суммированием. Наконец, показатель может быть дезагрегирован по различным категориям управления охраняемыми территориями (категории I &amp;#x2013; VI), чтобы отразить различные конкретные ориентиры управления охраняемыми территориями. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; В дополнение к агрегированию охвата охраняемых территорий по важным участкам для сохранения наземного и пресноводного биоразнообразия в качестве показателя достижения ЦУР 15.1, другие виды дезагрегирования охвата охраняемых районов, имеющих особое значение в качестве показателей достижения целевых показателей ЦУР (Brooks et al., 2016), включают: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ЦУР 14.5.1 Отношение  площади охраняемых районов к общей площади морских районов. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ЦУР 15.4.1 Охват охраняемыми территориями важных для биоразнообразия горных территорий. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Данные по охвату охраняемых территорий могут быть объединены с данными из других источников для получения других дополнительных показателей. Например, взаимное перекрытие охраняемых территорий с экорегиональными картами можно использовать для предоставления информации об охвате охраняемых территорий в различных биогеографических регионах. Охват охраняемых территорий распространения различных групп видов (например, млекопитающих, птиц, земноводных) может аналогичным образом обеспечивать показатели тенденций в охвате биоразнообразия на уровне видов. Охват охраняемых территорий может быть объединен с Индексом Красного списка для получения показателей воздействия охраняемых территорий на сокращение потерь биоразнообразия (Butchart et al. 2012). Наконец, показатели, полученные на основе взаимного перекрытия охраняемых территорий, также могут быть полезны для устойчивого городского развития; например, наложение охраняемых территорий на карты городов может служить показателем доли общественного пространства в общей площади города.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; Источники расхождений: &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Национальные процессы обеспечивают основную часть данных, которые впоследствии агрегируются как во Всемирную базу данных по охраняемым территориям, так и во Всемирную базу данных по ключевым районам сохранения биоразнообразия, и поэтому между национальными показателями и глобальными показателями очень мало различий. Одним из незначительных различий является то, что Всемирная база данных по охраняемым территориям включает охраняемые территории, определенные на международном уровне (например, объекты всемирного наследия ЮНЕСКО, Рамсарские угодья и т. д.), но некоторые из них не считаются в их суверенных странах охраняемыми территориями. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Обратите внимание, что, поскольку страны не предоставляют во Всемирную базу данных по охраняемым территориям полные данные по официально объявленным ликвидированными охраняемым территориям, более ранние значения показателя могут незначительно отличаться по охвату. Кроме того, существует отставание между временем, когда произошло наделение полномочиями охраняемой территории на местности, и временем, когда об этом сообщается во Всемирную базу данных по охраняемым территориям. Таким образом, текущий или предшествующий охват также может быть занижен. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Ссылки &lt;/h1&gt;
