	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data are collected by IOM staff based at IOM&amp;#x2019;s Global Migration Data Analysis Centre and in its Regional Offices on a daily basis. Disaggregated, incident-based data is uploaded to a public dataset twice weekly at &lt;a href=&quot;https://missingmigrants.iom.int&quot;&gt;https://missingmigrants.iom.int&lt;/a&gt;.
