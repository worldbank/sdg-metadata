	<message>The SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS field for indicator 10-7-3, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Indicator 10.7.2 is complementary to several related SDGs indicators. These include, but are not limited to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; Indicator 8.8.1 &amp;#x201C;Frequency rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries, by sex and migrant status&amp;#x201D;; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicator 10.7.2 is also complementary to other national migration monitoring frameworks, including IOM&amp;#x2019;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://migrationdataportal.org/overviews/mgi&quot;&gt;Migration Governance Indicators&lt;/a&gt; (MGI). The MGI operates as a policy benchmarking framework and offers insights into policy levers that countries could use to further develop their migration governance. It contains nearly 90 questions with regards to countries&amp;#x2019; national migration policies, which fall under the same six domains as indicator 10.7.2.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
