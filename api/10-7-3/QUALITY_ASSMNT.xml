			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Data on deaths during migration remains highly incomplete to the point that statistical assessment is nearly impossible. For this reason, the fully disaggregated MMP database includes a &amp;#x2018;source quality&amp;#x2019; indicator that indicates the type of information source for each incident involving a migrant death recorded. Little information is typically known about the overall population of irregular migrants in many countries, let alone of those on the move irregularly or the risks to life that they face on their journeys. &lt;/p&gt;
