	<message>The QUALITY_ASSURE field for indicator 10-7-3, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;As the data contained in the MMP dataset comes from a wide variety of sources, all data are verified by a team at IOM&amp;#x2019;s Global Migration Data Analysis Centre to ensure that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The incident reported meets MMP&amp;#x2019;s definition of a death during migration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The information contained in the report is accurate and complete&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All new incidents reported are checked against existing records to reduce the likelihood of double counting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter process usually consists of searching for separate reports on the same incident which contain similar information, including contacting the relevant authorities for confirmation where possible. The &amp;#x2018;Source quality&amp;#x2019; variable indicates the reliability of the information reported (see &lt;a href=&quot;#_Table_2:_Variables&quot;&gt;Table 2&lt;/a&gt; for details).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
