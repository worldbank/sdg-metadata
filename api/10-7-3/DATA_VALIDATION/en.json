{"status":"success","message":"The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 10-7-3, translated into en","data":"<p>In order for an incident involving a migrant death to be recorded in the dataset, there must be reasonable grounds to believe that it occurred. In practice, this means that whenever possible each incident is based on multiple independent sources of information. Whenever possible, and especially for incidents reported in the media, MMP verifies each incident through consultation with local IOM staff and other relevant stakeholders. In mass casualty events where large numbers of people die and no remains are recovered (i.e. in shipwrecks) MMP data reflect the lowest estimated number of dead and missing persons. Several variables in the disaggregated dataset available from the <a href=\"https://missingmigrants.iom.int\">MMP website</a> (Information source, Source Quality) reflect the level to which each incident could be validated.</p>"}
