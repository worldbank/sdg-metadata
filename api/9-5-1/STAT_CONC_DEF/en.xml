	<message>The STAT_CONC_DEF field for indicator 9-5-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definitions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research and experimental development (R&amp;amp;D) expenditure as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the amount of Research and experimental development (R&amp;amp;D) expenditure divided by the total output of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concepts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Frascati Manual (OECD, 2015) provides the relevant definitions for research and experimental development (R&amp;amp;D), gross domestic expenditure on research and experimental development (R&amp;amp;D) and researchers. Although an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) manual, the application is global. During the 6th revision of the Frascati Manual, developing country issues were mainstreamed in the core of the Manual. The 7th edition was released in October 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following definitions, taken from the 2015 edition of the Frascati Manual are relevant for computing the indicator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research and experimental development (R&amp;amp;D) comprise creative and systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge &amp;#x2013; including knowledge of humankind, culture and society &amp;#x2013; and to devise new applications of available knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expenditures on intramural research and experimental development (R&amp;amp;D) represent the amount of money spent on research and experimental development (R&amp;amp;D) that is performed within a reporting unit.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
