Each accession should be distinct and, in terms of genetic integrity, as close as possible to the sample provided originally.</p>\n<p><em>Base collection:</em> A base collection is defined as a set of unique accessions to be preserved for a medium to long-term period.</p>\n<p><em>Active collection:</em> An active collection is defined as a set of distinct accessions that is used for regeneration, multiplication, distribution, characterization and evaluation. Active collections are maintained in short to medium-term storage and usually duplicated in a base collection. </p>\n<p><em>Medium or long term conservation facilities:</em> Biological diversity is often conserved <em>ex situ</em>, outside its natural habitat, in facilities called genebanks. In the case of plant genetic resources, genebanks conserve base collections under medium or long term storage conditions, in the form of seeds in cold rooms, plants in the field and tissues <em>in vitro</em> and/or cryoconserved. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Animal genetic resources</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Breed:</em> A breed is either a sub-specific group of domestic livestock with definable and identifiable external characteristics that enable it to be separated by visual appraisal from other similarly defined groups within the same species, or a group for which geographical and/or cultural separation from phenotypically similar groups has led to acceptance of its separate identity. </p>\n<p><em>Medium or long term conservation facilities:</em> Biological diversity is often conserved <em>ex situ</em>, outside its natural habitat, in facilities called genebanks. In the case of domestic animal diversity, <em>ex situ</em> conservation includes both the maintenance of live animals (<em>in vivo</em>) and cryoconservation. </p>\n<p><em>Cryoconservation</em> is the collection and deep-freezing of semen, ova, embryos or tissues for potential future use in breeding or regenerating animals.</p><h1>Data sources</h1>\n<h2>Description:</h2>\n<p><strong><em>Plant genetic resources</em></strong></p>\n<p>Data are sourced from officially appointed National Focal Points (NFP) (see <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/thematic-sitemap/theme/seeds-pgr/gpa/national-focal-points/en/\">http://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/thematic-sitemap/theme/seeds-pgr/gpa/national-focal-points/en/</a>) and regional and international agricultural research centres holding PGRFA <em>ex situ</em> collections.

As the conservation and accessibility to these resources are of vital importance, medium- or long- term conservation facilities (genebanks) to preserve and make these resources and their associated information accessible for breeding and research have been established at country, regional and global levels. Inventories of genebank holdings provide a dynamic measure of the existing plant and animal diversity and its level of preservation. Data relevant to this indicator facilitate the monitoring of diversity secured and accessible through genebanks and support the development and updating of strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources.</p>\n<p>The indicator is related to a monitoring framework endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture in which the status and trends of plant and animal genetic resources are described through globally agreed indicators and regular country-driven assessments. </p>\n<p>The number of materials conserved under medium- or long-term storage conditions provides an indirect measurement of the total genetic diversity, which are managed to secure for future use. Overall, positive variations are therefore approximated to an increase in the agro-biodiversity secured, while negative variations to a loss of it. </p>\n<p>Caution needs to be paid in the reporting and interpretation of the indicator. In the case of plant genetic resources, an uncontrolled addition of accessions that are in fact duplicates of samples already conserved and accounted for, or, <em>vice versa</em>, the deletion from the reported collections of redundant duplicates may lead to wrong interpretations. In order to avoid duplicate counting at the national level, primarily base collections should be reported. An active collection could be reported, only when, in the absence of a base collection, it also serves the function of the base collection. Another example that needs to be monitored both while reporting and interpreting the results include the grouping or splitting of accessions, as in both cases the variation in the accounted number does not reflect a variation in the genetic diversity conserved and secured. Therefore, it is crucial that reporting countries and regional/international centres together with the accession level information requested explain also the reason for the decrease or increase in the number of accessions, in particular when this does not reflect a real loss or gain in the genetic diversity conserved and secured.</p><h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n<p><strong><em>Plant genetic resources</em></strong></p>\n<p>Broadly, two issues are of concern in using the &#x201C;number of accessions&#x201D; as an indicator of diversity in <em>ex situ</em> collections:</p>\n<p>Undetected duplicates of accessions may contribute to an increase of the indicator, as each accession is a managed unit, kept and recorded as distinct. The detection of such duplicates will therefore result in a reduction in the number of accession previously reported. This can occur at different levels, for example within genebank collections and also at international level.</p>\n<p>A loss of viability of the material(s) conserved that is not promptly detected may similarly not be reflected in the number of accessions, contributing to an overestimate of the actual number of accessions.</p>\n<p>Additional information could be provided by other indicators measuring <em>ex situ</em> conservation, which are part of the monitoring of the implementation of the Global Plan of Action for PGRFA under the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Animal genetic resources</em></strong></p>\n<p>Information on cryoconserved material in the Domestic Animal Diversity Information System DAD-IS needs to be updated on a regular base.</p><h1>Methodology</h1>\n<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n<p><strong><em>Plant genetic resources</em></strong></p>\n<p>The plant component of the indicator is calculated as the total number of unique accessions of plant genetic resources secured in medium to long term conservation facilities. This should include all the accessions in base collections, and unique accessions stored in medium term conservation facilities, as active collections, only when these accessions are considered to become part of the national base collections. Base collections may include both seed, field, cryo-preserved or in vitro collections depending on the species conserved and the available facilities in the country.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Animal genetic resources</em></strong></p>\n<p>For the animal component the indicator is calculated as the number of local breeds with enough genetic material stored within genebank collections allowing to reconstitute the breed in case of extinction (based on the Guidelines on Cryconservation of animal genetic resources, FAO, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm\">http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm</a>).</p><h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For plants missing values are treated as such and not replaced by estimates.

In this case the nature of data is considered to be estimated. However, if the most recent reporting refers to a year more than 10- years before, the storage status is considered &#x201C;unknown&#x201D;. </p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>At regional and global levels:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For both components, plants and animals, missing values are treated as such and not replaced by estimates.</p><h2>Regional aggregates:</h2>\n<p>For both components, plants and animals, aggregates are the sum of country values.</p><h2>Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level:</h2>\n<p>For the plant component of the indicator, officially appointed National Focal Points and managers of regional or international genebanks are requested to provide the list of accessions conserved in medium or long term conservation facilities by filling a spreadsheet contained in document List of descriptors for reporting on the Plant Component of SDG indicator 2.5.1 (see References) accessible from the WIEWS home page (<a href=\"http://www.fao.org/wiews\">http://www.fao.org/wiews</a>). Out of the 12 passport descriptors which can be used to characterize each accession, four are mandatory: (i) the name of the genebank (or <em>holding institute code</em>); (ii) the <em>accession number</em><sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-ref-1\">[1]</a></sup>; (iii) the scientific name of the accession (<em>name of taxon</em>, including genus, species and lower taxonomic ranking); and (iv) the type of storage. Reporting on the remaining descriptors is highly recommended, as it allows the analysis of changes in different types of diversity concerned, including changes in the type and origin of the material secured (e.g. <em>biological status</em>; <em>country of origin</em>; <em>locations of safety duplications</em>; etc.) and better describes the composition of the secured materials. The descriptors have been agreed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (see question 6.2 in the &#x201C;Reporting format for monitoring the implementation of the Second global Plan of Action for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture&#x201D; <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-mm294e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/3/a-mm294e.pdf</a>).

Los acervos activos se mantienen almacenados a corto o medio plazo y suelen estar duplicados en un acervo base. </p>\n<p><em>Instalaciones de conservación a medio o largo plazo:</em> La diversidad biológica suele conservarse <em>ex situ</em>, fuera de su hábitat natural, en instalaciones denominadas bancos de genes. En el caso de los recursos fitogenéticos, los bancos de genes conservan acervos base en condiciones de almacenamiento a medio o largo plazo, en forma de semillas en cámaras frigoríficas, plantas en el campo y tejidos <em>in vitro</em> y/o crioconservados. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Recursos genéticos animales</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Raza:</em> Una raza es un grupo subespecífico de ganado doméstico con características externas definibles e identificables que permiten separarlo por apreciación visual de otros grupos definidos de forma similar dentro de la misma especie, o un grupo para el que la separación geográfica y/o cultural de grupos fenotípicamente similares ha llevado a la aceptación de su identidad separada. </p>\n<p><em>Instalaciones de conservación a medio o largo plazo:</em> La diversidad biológica suele conservarse <em>ex situ</em>, fuera de su hábitat natural, en instalaciones denominadas bancos de genes. En el caso de la diversidad de animales domésticos, la conservación <em>ex situ</em> incluye tanto el mantenimiento de animales vivos (<em>in vivo</em>) como la crioconservación. </p>\n<p><em>La crioconservación</em> es la recolección y congelación de semen, óvulos, embriones o tejidos para su posible uso futuro en la cría o regeneración de animales.</p><h1>Fuentes de datos</h1>\n<h2>Descripción: </h2>\n<p><strong><em>Recursos fitogenéticos</em></strong></p>\n<p>Los datos proceden de los Puntos Focales Nacionales (PFN) designados oficialmente (véase <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/thematic-sitemap/theme/seeds-pgr/gpa/national-focal-points/en/\">http://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/thematic-sitemap/theme/seeds-pgr/gpa/national-focal-points/en/</a>) y de los centros regionales e internacionales de investigación agrícola que poseen colecciones de RFAA <em>ex situ</em>.

El DAD-IS permite a los países el almacenamiento de datos sobre los recursos genéticos animales que están siendo asegurados en instalaciones de conservación a medio o largo plazo, según sea necesario para el indicador.</p><h2>Proceso de recolección:</h2>\n<p>El indicador está relacionado con un marco de seguimiento aprobado por la Comisión de Recursos Genéticos para la Alimentación y la Agricultura de la FAO, en el que la condición y las tendencias de los recursos genéticos vegetales y animales se describen a través de indicadores acordados a nivel mundial y evaluaciones periódicas impulsadas por los países.

Para información por país, véase para los recursos fitogenéticos <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/thematic-sitemap/theme/seeds-pgr/gpa/national-focal-points/en/\">http://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/thematic-sitemap/theme/seeds-pgr/gpa/national-focal-points/en/</a> y para los recursos zoogenéticos <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/dad-is/national-coordinators/en/\">http://www.fao.org/dad-is/national-coordinators/en/</a> .</p><h1>Compiladores de datos</h1>\n<p>Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Agricultura y la Alimentación (FAO)</p><p><strong>Justificación:</strong></p>\n<p>Los recursos genéticos para la alimentación y la agricultura proporcionan los elementos básicos de la seguridad alimentaria y, directa o indirectamente, sustentan los medios de vida de todos los habitantes del planeta. Dado que la conservación y la accesibilidad a estos recursos son de vital importancia, se han establecido instalaciones de conservación a medio o largo plazo (bancos de genes) para preservar y hacer accesibles estos recursos y su información asociada para el cultivo y la investigación a nivel nacional, regional y mundial. Los inventarios de los bancos de genes proporcionan una medida dinámica de la diversidad vegetal y animal existente y de su nivel de conservación. Los datos relevantes para este indicador facilitan el seguimiento de la diversidad asegurada y accesible a través de los bancos de genes y apoyan el desarrollo y la actualización de estrategias para la conservación y el uso sostenible de los recursos genéticos.</p>\n<p>El indicador está relacionado con un marco de seguimiento aprobado por la Comisión de Recursos Genéticos para la Alimentación y la Agricultura de la FAO, en el que la condición y las tendencias de los recursos genéticos vegetales y animales se describen a través de indicadores acordados a nivel mundial y evaluaciones periódicas impulsadas por los países. </p>\n<p>El número de materiales conservados en condiciones de almacenamiento a medio o largo plazo proporciona una medida indirecta de la diversidad genética total, que se gestiona para asegurar su uso futuro. En general, las variaciones positivas se aproximan por tanto a un aumento de la agrobiodiversidad asegurada, mientras que las variaciones negativas a una perdida de ésta. </p>\n<p>Hay que tener cuidado con la presentación de informes y la interpretación del indicador. En el caso de los recursos fitogenéticos, una adición incontrolada de accesiones que en realidad son duplicados de muestras ya conservadas y contabilizadas, o, <em>viceversa</em>, la supresión de los acervos notificados de duplicados redundantes puede llevar a interpretaciones erróneas. Para evitar el recuento de duplicados a nivel nacional, deberían notificarse principalmente los acervos base. Un acervo activo podría notificarse solo cuando, en ausencia de un acervo base, cumpla también la función del acervo base. Otro ejemplo que debe vigilarse tanto al informar como al interpretar los resultados es la agrupación o la división de las accesiones, ya que en ambos casos la variación en el número contabilizado no refleja una variación en la diversidad genética conservada y asegurada. Por lo tanto, es crucial que los países informantes y los centros regionales/internacionales, junto con la información solicitada a nivel de accesión, expliquen también la razón de la disminución o el aumento del número de accesiones, en particular cuando esto no refleja una pérdida o ganancia real en la diversidad genética conservada y asegurada.</p><h2>Observaciones y limitaciones:</h2>\n<p><strong><em>Recursos fitogenéticos</em></strong></p>\n<p>En general, hay dos cuestiones que preocupan al utilizar el &#x201C;número de accesiones&#x201D; como indicador de la diversidad en los acervos <em>ex situ</em>:</p>\n<p>Los duplicados no detectados de las accesiones pueden contribuir a aumentar el indicador, ya que cada accesión es una unidad gestionada, conservada y registrada como distinta. Por lo tanto, la detección de tales duplicados dará lugar a una reducción del número de accesiones previamente notificadas. Esto puede ocurrir en diferentes niveles, por ejemplo dentro de los acervos de los bancos de genes y también a nivel internacional.</p>\n<p>Una pérdida de viabilidad del material o los materiales conservados que no se detecte rápidamente puede igualmente no reflejarse en el número de accesiones, contribuyendo a una sobreestimación del número real de accesiones.</p>\n<p>Otros indicadores que miden la conservación <em>ex situ</em>, que forman parte del seguimiento de la aplicación del Plan de Acción Mundial para los RFAA en el marco de la Comisión de Recursos Genéticos para la Alimentación y la Agricultura de la FAO, podrían proporcionar información adicional. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Recursos genéticos animales</em></strong></p>\n<p>La información sobre el material crioconservado en el Sistema de Información sobre la Diversidad de los Animales Domésticos (DAD-IS) debe actualizarse periódicamente.</p><h1>Metodología</h1>\n<h2>Método de cálculo:</h2>\n<p><strong><em>Recursos fitogenéticos</em></strong></p>\n<p>El componente vegetal del indicador se calcula como el número total de accesiones únicas de recursos fitogenéticos aseguradas en instalaciones de conservación a medio y largo plazo. Esto debería incluir todas las accesiones en acervos base, y las accesiones únicas almacenadas en instalaciones de conservación a medio plazo, como acervos activos, solo cuando se considere que estas accesiones pasan a formar parte de los acervos base nacionales. Los acervos base pueden incluir acervos de semillas, de campo, criopreservadas o in vitro, dependiendo de las especies conservadas y de las instalaciones disponibles en el país.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Recursos genéticos animales</em></strong></p>\n<p>Para el componente animal, el indicador se calcula como el número de razas locales con suficiente material genético almacenado en acervos de bancos de genes que permitan reconstituir la raza en caso de extinción (basado en las Directrices sobre la crioconservación de los recursos genéticos animales, FAO, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm\">http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm</a>).</p><h2>Tratamiento de valores faltantes:</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>A nivel de país:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>En el caso de las plantas, los valores faltantes se tratan como tales y no se sustituyen por estimaciones. En el caso de los animales, si no se facilitan datos para un año determinado, se supone que el estado de almacenamiento sigue siendo el mismo que el del último año del que se han comunicado datos. En este caso, la naturaleza de los datos se considera estimada. Sin embargo, si el último informe se refiere a un año de más de 10 años, el estado de almacenamiento se considera &#x201C;desconocido&#x201D;. </p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>A nivel regional y mundial:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Para ambos componentes, plantas y animales, los valores que faltan se tratan como tales y no se sustituyen por estimaciones.</p><h2>Agregados regionales:</h2>\n<p>Para ambos componentes, plantas y animales, los agregados son la suma de los valores de los países.</p><h2>Métodos y directrices a disposición de los países para la compilación de los datos a nivel nacional:</h2>\n<p>Para el componente vegetal del indicador, se solicita a los Puntos Focales Nacionales oficialmente designados y a los gestores de los bancos de genes regionales o internacionales que proporcionen la lista de accesiones conservadas en instalaciones de conservación a medio o largo plazo completando una hoja de cálculo contenida en el documento Lista de descriptores para informar sobre el componente vegetal del indicador 2.5.1 de los ODS (ver Referencias) accesible desde la página principal del SMIA (<a href=\"http://www.fao.org/wiews\">http://www.fao.org/wiews</a>).

Se recomienda encarecidamente informar sobre los descriptores restantes, ya que permite analizar los cambios en los diferentes tipos de diversidad afectados, incluidos los cambios en el tipo y el origen del material asegurado (por ejemplo, <em>estado biológico</em>; <em>país de origen</em>; <em>ubicaciones de las duplicaciones de seguridad</em>; etc.) y describe mejor la composición de los materiales asegurados.

En marzo de 2018, la información reportada en DAD-IS seguía siendo escasa.

Los datos de los informes de los países no son directamente comparables con los del DAD-IS, porque los informes de los países se refieren también a las razas transfronterizas.

Comme la conservation et l'accessibilité de ces ressources sont d'une importance vitale, des installations de conservation à moyen ou long terme (banques de gènes) ont été mises en place aux niveaux national, régional et mondial pour préserver et rendre accessibles ces ressources et les informations qui y sont associées pour la sélection et la recherche. Les inventaires des fonds des banques de gènes fournissent une mesure dynamique de la diversité végétale et animale existante et de son niveau de préservation. Les données relatives à cet indicateur facilitent le suivi de la diversité assurée et accessible par les banques de gènes et soutiennent l'élaboration et la mise à jour des stratégies de conservation et d'utilisation durable des ressources génétiques. </p>\n<p> L'indicateur est lié à un cadre de suivi approuvé par la Commission des ressources génétiques pour l'alimentation et l'agriculture de la FAO, dans lequel l'état et les tendances des ressources génétiques végétales et animales sont décrits au moyen d'indicateurs convenus au niveau mondial, et d'évaluations régulières menées par les pays. </p>\n<p>Le nombre de matériaux conservés dans des conditions de stockage à moyen ou long terme fournit une mesure indirecte de la diversité génétique totale, qui est gérée de manière à garantir une utilisation future. Globalement, les variations positives correspondent donc à une augmentation de l'agrobiodiversité préservée, tandis que les variations négatives correspondent à une perte de celle-ci. </p>\n<p>Il faut faire preuve de prudence dans la déclaration et l'interprétation de l'indicateur. Dans le cas des ressources phytogénétiques, l'ajout non contrôlé d'entrées qui sont en fait des doubles d'échantillons déjà conservés et comptabilisés, ou, <em> vice versa</em>, la suppression de doubles redondants des collections déclarées peut conduire à des interprétations erronées. Afin d'éviter le double comptage au niveau national, il convient de déclarer principalement les collections de base. Une collection active ne peut être déclarée que si, en l'absence d'une collection de base, elle remplit également la fonction de collection de base. Un autre exemple qui doit être surveillé à la fois lors de la déclaration et de l'interprétation des résultats, est le regroupement ou le fractionnement des accessions, car dans les deux cas, la variation du nombre comptabilisé ne reflète pas une variation de la diversité génétique conservée et sécurisée. Il est donc essentiel que les pays et les centres régionaux/internationaux déclarants, ainsi que les informations demandées sur le niveau des adhésions, expliquent également la raison de la diminution ou de l'augmentation du nombre d'adhésions, en particulier lorsque cela ne reflète pas une perte ou un gain réel de la diversité génétique conservée et sécurisée.</p><h2>Commentaires et limites : </h2>\n<p><strong><em> Ressources phytogénétiques </em></strong></p>\n<p>D'une manière générale, deux questions sont préoccupantes dans l'utilisation du « nombre d'entrées » comme indicateur de la diversité des collections <em>ex-situ</em>. </p>\n<p>Les doubles d'adhésions non détectées peuvent contribuer à une augmentation de l'indicateur, car chaque adhésion est une unité gérée, conservée et enregistrée comme distincte. La détection de ces doublons entraînera donc une réduction du nombre d'adhésions précédemment déclarées. Cela peut se produire à différents niveaux, par exemple au sein des collections des banques de gènes et également au niveau international. </p>\n<p> Une perte de viabilité du ou des matériels conservés qui n'est pas rapidement détectée peut également ne pas se refléter dans le nombre d'entrées, ce qui contribue à surestimer le nombre réel d'entrées.</p>\n<p> Des informations supplémentaires pourraient être fournies par d'autres indicateurs mesurant la conservation <em>ex-situ</em>, qui font partie du suivi de la mise en œuvre du Plan d'action mondial pour les RPGAA sous l'égide de la Commission des ressources génétiques pour l'alimentation et l'agriculture de la FAO. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Ressources génétiques animales </em></strong></p>\n<p>Les informations sur le matériel cryoconservé dans le système d'information sur la diversité des animaux domestiques DAD-IS doivent être mises à jour régulièrement. </p><h1>Méthodologie</h1>\n<h2>Méthode de calcul :</h2>\n<p><strong><em>Ressources phytogénétiques</em></strong></p>\n<p>La composante plantes de l'indicateur est calculée comme le nombre total d'accessions uniques de ressources phytogénétiques obtenues dans des installations de conservation à moyen et long terme. Cela doit inclure toutes les accessions dans les collections de base, et les accessions uniques stockées dans des installations de conservation à moyen terme, en tant que collections actives, uniquement lorsque ces accessions sont considérées comme faisant partie des collections de base nationales.

Каждый образец должен иметь отличительные черты, но, с точки зрения генетической целостности, быть как можно ближе к первоначально представленному образцу. </p>\n<p> <em> Базовая коллекция:</em> Базовая коллекция определяется как набор уникальных образцов, которые должны сохраняться в течение средне- и долгосрочного периода. </p>\n<p> <em> Активная коллекция:</em> Активная коллекция определяется как набор отдельных образцов, который используется для восстановления, размножения, распространения, определения характерных признаков и оценки. Активные коллекции закладываются на короткие или средние сроки хранения и обычно дублируются в базовой коллекции. </p>\n<p> <em> Объекты средне- или долгосрочного сохранения:</em> Биологическое разнообразие часто сохраняется \"ex situ\" за пределами естественной среды обитания в объектах, называемых генными банками. Что касается генетических ресурсов растительного происхождения, то генные банки сохраняют базовые коллекции в среднесрочных или долгосрочных условиях хранения в виде семян в холодильных камерах, растений в поле и тканей растений \"in vitro\" и / или в криоконсервированном состоянии. </p>\n<p> <strong> <em> Генетические ресурсы зоологического происхождения</em> </strong> </p>\n<p> <em> Порода: </em> Порода - это либо подвидовая группа домашнего скота с определяемыми и идентифицируемыми внешними характеристиками, которые позволяют отделить ее посредством визуальной оценки от других аналогичным образом определенных групп в пределах того же вида, либо группа, для которой географическое и / или культурное отделение от фенотипически подобные группы привело к принятию ее как отдельной идентичности. </p>\n<p> <em> Объекты средне- или долгосрочного сохранения:</em> Биологическое разнообразие часто сохраняется \"ex situ\" за пределами естественной среды обитания в объектах, называемых генными банками. В случае разнообразия домашних животных сохранение \"ex situ\" включает в себя как содержание живых животных (\"in vivo\"), так и криоконсервацию. </p>\n<p> <em> Криоконсервация</em> это сбор и глубокое замораживание спермы, яйцеклеток, эмбрионов или тканей растений для потенциального использования в будущем при разведении или регенерации животных. </p><h1> Источники данных </h1>\n<h2> Описание: </h2>\n<p> <strong> <em> Генетические ресурсы растительного происхождения </em> </strong> </p>\n<p>Данные поступают от официально назначенных национальных координаторов (НК) (см. <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/thematic-sitemap/theme/seeds-pgr/gpa/national-focal-points /en/\">http://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/thematic-sitemap/theme/seeds-pgr/gpa/national-focal-points/en/</a>) и региональных и международных сельскохозяйственных исследовательских центров, хранящих коллекции ГРРПСХ \"ex situ\".

Поскольку сохранность и доступность этих ресурсов имеют жизненно важное значение, то на национальном, региональном и глобальном уровнях были созданы средства среднесрочного или длительного хранения (генные банки) для защиты и обеспечения доступа к этим ресурсам и связанной с ними информации для селекции и исследований. Инвентаризация запасов генобанков позволяет динамически оценивать существующее разнообразие генетических ресурсов растительного и зоологического происхождения и уровень его сохранности. Данные, относящиеся к этому показателю, облегчают мониторинг разнообразия, обеспечиваемого и становящегося доступным с помощью генных банков, и поддерживают разработку и обновление стратегий сохранения и устойчивого использования генетических ресурсов. </p>\n<p> Показатель связан с системой мониторинга, одобренной Комиссией ФАО по генетическим ресурсам для производства продовольствия и ведения сельского хозяйства, в которой состояние и тенденции генетических ресурсов растительного и зоологического происхождения описываются с помощью согласованных на глобальном уровне показателей и регулярных оценок, проводимых по инициативе стран. </p>\n<p> Количество материалов, содержащихся в условиях среднесрочного или длительного хранения, позволяет косвенно оценить общее генетическое разнообразие, которое необходимо сохранить для будущего использования. Таким образом, в целом положительные изменения показателя направлены на увеличение гарантированного агробиоразнообразия, а отрицательные - на его утрату. </p>\n<p> Следует проявлять осторожность при составлении отчетов и интерпретации показателя. В случае генетических ресурсов растительного происхождения неконтролируемое добавление образцов, которые фактически являются дубликатами уже сохраняемых и учтенных образцов, или, наоборот, удаление из представленных коллекций повторяющихся дубликатов может привести к неправильной интерпретации данных. Чтобы избежать дублирования при подсчете на национальном уровне, следует представлять в первую очередь информацию о базовой коллекции. Представлять данные по рабочей коллекции можно только тогда, когда в отсутствие информации по базовой коллекции рабочая коллекция выполняет функцию базовой коллекции. Другой пример, который необходимо отслеживать как при составлении отчетов, так и при интерпретации результатов, включает группирование или разделение образцов, поскольку в обоих случаях вариация в учтенном количестве не отражает вариации в сохраняемом и защищаемом генетическом разнообразии. Таким образом, крайне важно, чтобы страны и региональные / международные центры, представляющие отчеты, вместе с запрошенной информацией об уровне наличия образцов также объяснили причину уменьшения или увеличения количества образцов, в частности, когда эта информация не отражает факт реальной снижения или повышения сохраняемого и защищаемого генетического разнообразия.</p><h2> Комментарии и ограничения: </h2>\n<p> <strong> <em> Генетические ресурсы растительного происхождения </em> </strong> </p>\n<p> В целом две проблемы вызывают озабоченность при использовании \"количества образцов\" в качестве показателя разнообразия в коллекциях \"ex situ\": </p>\n<p> Не выявленные дубликаты образцов могут вызывать увеличение показателя, поскольку каждый образец является функциональной единицей, которая хранится и регистрируется как отдельная единица. Таким образом, процесс выявления таких дубликатов приведет к сокращению числа ранее зарегистрированных образцов. Этот процесс может происходить на разных уровнях, например, в документации коллекций генных банков, а также в списках на международном уровне. </p>\n<p> Потеря жизнеспособности сохраняемых материалов, не обнаруженная своевременно, также может быть не отражена в документации как уменьшение количества образцов, что приведет к завышению фактического количества сохраняемых образцов. </p>\n<p> Дополнительная информация может быть получена из других показателей, оценивающих сохранение \"ex situ\", которые являются частью процесса мониторинга реализации Глобального плана действий по ГРРПСХ, проводимого Комиссией ФАО по генетическим ресурсам для производства продовольствия и ведения сельского хозяйства. </p>\n<p><em><strong>Генетические ресурсы зоологического происхождения</em></strong></p>\n<p> Информация о криоконсервированных материалах в Информационной системе о разнообразии домашних животных (ИС-РДЖ) должна обновляться на регулярной основе.</p><h1> Методология </h1>\n<h2> Метод расчета: </h2>\n<p> <strong> <em> Генетические ресурсы растительного происхождения</em> </strong> </p>\n<p> Растительный компонент показателя рассчитывается как общее количество уникальных образцов генетических ресурсов растительного происхождения, содержащихся в объектах средне- и долгосрочного хранения.
