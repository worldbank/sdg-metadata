	<message>The DOC_METHOD field for indicator 8-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;To calculate this indicator (according to the ILO definitions of unemployment and unemployment rate), data is needed on both the labour force and the unemployed, by sex and age (and eventually disability status). This data is collected at the national level mainly through labour force surveys (or other types of household surveys with an employment module). For the methodology of each national household survey, one must refer to the most comprehensive survey report or to the methodological publications of the national statistical office in question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For further information, see section 7 with references and documentation. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
