The unemployment estimates derived from the ILO modelled estimates are used to produce global and regional estimates on unemployment rates. These models use multivariate regression techniques to impute missing values at the country level, which are then aggregated to produce regional and global estimates. For further information on the estimates, please refer to the the ILO modelled estimates methodological overview, available at <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/TEM.pdf\">https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/TEM.pdf</a>.</p>","es":"","fr":"","ru":""}}
