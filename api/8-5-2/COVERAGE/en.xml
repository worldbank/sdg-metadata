	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 8-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data disaggregated by sex and age for this indicator is available for 217 countries and territories in the 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; ICLS series and 126 countries and territories in the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; ICLS series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is widely available based on real observations provided by countries and derived from national labour force surveys, other types of household surveys or population census. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the disaggregation by disability is not as widely available and this submission only includes 109 countries and territories in the 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; ICLS series and 73 countries and territories in the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; ICLS series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Data for disaggregation by sex and age for this indicator is available as of 2000 for countries in the SDG Indicators Global Database, but time series going back further are available in ILOSTAT. Global and regional aggregates disaggregated by sex and age are available through 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data for disaggregation by disability status is available for the period from 2003 to 2022 at the country level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator should, ideally, be disaggregated by sex, age group and disability status. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
