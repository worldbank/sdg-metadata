	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 8-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data disaggregated by sex and age for this indicator is available for 216 countries and territories. The indicator is widely available based on real observations provided by countries and derived from national labour force surveys, other types of household surveys or population census. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the disaggregation by disability is not widely available and this submission only includes 101 countries and territories. It is increasingly reported but coverage is still very low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Data for disaggregation by sex and age for this indicator is available as of 2000 until 2021 for countries in the SDG Indicators Global Database, but time series going back further are available in ILOSTAT. 2020 regional aggregates are available for total population. Global and regional aggregates disaggregated by sex and age are available through 2020 and aggregates disaggregated by sex only are available for 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data for disaggregation by disability status is available for the period from 2003 to 2021 at the country level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator should, ideally, be disaggregated by sex, age group and disability status. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
