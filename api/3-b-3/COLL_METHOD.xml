&lt;p&gt;WHO obtains SARA survey data on availability and affordability from the countries&amp;#x2019; Ministries of Health (MoH). HAI/WHO historical data collected at the facility level is available from HAI by request, as publicly available HAI/WHO data on the HAI website has already aggregated at the country level. The EMP MedMon data on availability and medicine prices is collected in collaboration between WHO and Ministries of Health of the countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;NPLs, LPGW wages, DALYs:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National poverty reports consistently provide information on the &lt;em&gt;NPLs &lt;/em&gt;in local currency units. The updated and recalculated NPLs are also published by the countries in these poverty reports. The &lt;em&gt;wage of the LPGW &lt;/em&gt;is published in the ILOSTAT database. Information regarding the &lt;em&gt;regional burden of diseases (DALYs) &lt;/em&gt;is publicly available and published by WHO.&lt;/p&gt;
