{"status":"success","message":"The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 3-b-3, translated into en","data":"<p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>\n<p>Data can be received from three data sources: SARA, HAI/WHO, and the EMP MedMon. These data collection methods demonstrate the following discrepancies:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Sampling of the facilities to be surveyed,</li>\n  <li>Size of the sampling of the facilities to be surveyed, and</li>\n  <li>Questions asked at facility level to capture availability (i.e. SARA considers potentially available expired medicines as well).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>WHO will use any of these three data sources available for the year of calculation as a compromise between the limitations that these discrepancies pose to the proposed methodology and the need to overcome data availability issues in order to start reporting on this critical indicator. In the unlikely case that data is available through more than one data source for a specific country, WHO will rely on the source with a larger sample size and a higher percentage of medicines from the defined core list captured by the survey.</p>"}
