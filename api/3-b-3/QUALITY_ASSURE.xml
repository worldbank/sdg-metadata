			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Quality control can be performed based on the median availability and median consumer price ratio of selected generic medicines listed on the Global Health Observatory (GHO). The quality of the key components of this indicator (i.e. availability, prices, etc.) can be assured for data collected using any of the three mechanisms listed above when cross-referenced with the GHO values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For future data collection, quality will be based on the analysis of the sample size and the number of medicines captured in the basket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries will collect and share data with the WHO Secretariat. WHO will subsequently compute the indicator and return to the countries for validation. By request, WHO will also provide all background materials and training for data collection and indicator computation.&lt;/p&gt;
