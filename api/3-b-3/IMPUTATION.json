For example, in some countries medicines for in-patient care (mostly in injectable forms) are provided only in hospitals.

In order to calculate a regionally aggregated 3.b.3 indicator, a 5-year period of data collection will be used as a reference to identify the available indicators for all the countries in the region. If during the defined 5-year period, one country of the region does not have even one indicator result, this country will not be included in the regional aggregate. The missing values from the countries can only be imputed when at least one data point exists for the given country in such a 5-year period.</p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
