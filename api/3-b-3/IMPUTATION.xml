  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At country level &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment of missing values has already been partially addressed. In particular, when a medicine is not available, its price cannot be collected. For this reason, missing price values are considered as the medicine not being available and therefore not accessible (access = 0).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observing missing values for availability and affordability simultaneously indicates that these medicines are not provided at all in the surveyed facility. For example, in some countries medicines for in-patient care (mostly in injectable forms) are provided only in hospitals. In this case, the procedure for computing the indicator is the same except that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Medicines that are used for inpatient care are excluded from the analysis of the data collected in pharmacies and other non-tertiary health care facilities, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two different versions of weights are applied to the list of medicines for hospitals and for pharmacies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At regional and global levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When computing regional or global aggregates of indicator 3.b.3, it is possible to accommodate missing values from countries resulting from a lack of data collection for a given country in a given year. In order to calculate a regionally aggregated 3.b.3 indicator, a 5-year period of data collection will be used as a reference to identify the available indicators for all the countries in the region. If during the defined 5-year period, one country of the region does not have even one indicator result, this country will not be included in the regional aggregate. The missing values from the countries can only be imputed when at least one data point exists for the given country in such a 5-year period.&lt;/p&gt;
