	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 5-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Through the ILO Harmonized Microdata initiative, the ILO strives to produce internationally comparable labour statistics based on the indicator concepts and definitions adopted by the ICLS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work statistics for countries not using the same set of statistical standards are not comparable. As such, each series is based on a single set of standards (i.e., 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; or 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; ICLS) and contains only data comparable within and across countries, allowing data users to continue making meaningful time series analysis and international comparisons. Users should not compare data across series. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
