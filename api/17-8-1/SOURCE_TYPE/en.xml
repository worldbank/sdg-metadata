	<message>The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 17-8-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The indicator proportion of individuals using the Internet is based on an internationally agreed definition and methodology, which have been developed under the coordination of ITU, through its Expert Groups and following an extensive consultation process with countries. It is also a core indicator of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development&amp;apos;s Core List of Indicators, which has been endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission (last time in 2014). Data on individuals using the Internet are collected through an annual questionnaire that ITU sends to national statistical offices (NSO). In this questionnaire ITU collects absolute values. The percentages are calculated a-posteriori. The survey methodology is verified to ensure that it meets adequate statistical standards. The data are verified to ensure consistency with previous years&amp;#x2019; data and situation of the country for other related indicators (ICT and economic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most developed and an increasing number of developing countries, the percentage of individuals using the Internet data are based on methodologically sound household surveys conducted by national statistical agencies. If the NSO has not collected Internet user statistics, then ITU estimates the percentage of individuals using the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data are usually not adjusted, but discrepancies in the definition, age scope of individuals, reference period or the break in comparability between years are noted in a data note. For this reason, data are not always strictly comparable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some countries conduct a household survey where the question on Internet use is included every year. For others, the frequency is every two or three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ITU makes the indicator available for each year for 200 economies by using survey data and estimates for almost all countries of the world.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
