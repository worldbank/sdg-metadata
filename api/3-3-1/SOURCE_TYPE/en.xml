	<data>&lt;p&gt;Spectrum modelling is used for the data presented here which incorporates programme data, surveillance data, survey data and region-specific assumptions about the HIV epidemic. Alternative methods of measures include household or key population surveys with HIV incidence-testing, or routine surveillance among key populations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model development is guided by the UNAIDS Reference Group on Estimates, Modelling and Projections provides technical guidance on the development of the HIV component of the Spectrum software (www.epidem.org). The Spectrum software is developed by Avenir Health (www.avenirhealth.org)&amp;#x2014;which includes a module, the Estimates and Projections Package, which is developed by the East-West Center (www.eastwestcenter.org). &lt;/p&gt;</data>
