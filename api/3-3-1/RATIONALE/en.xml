	<data>&lt;p&gt;The incidence rate provides a measure of progress toward preventing onward transmission of HIV. Although other indicators are also very important to the HIV epidemic, HIV incidence reflects success in prevention programmes and, to some extent, successful treatment programmes, as those will also lead to lower HIV incidence.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
