	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 3-3-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Longitudinal data on individuals newly infected with HIV would be the most accurate source of data to measure HIV incidence, however these data are rarely available for representative populations. Special diagnostic tests in surveys or from health facilities can also be used to obtain data on HIV incidence but these require very large samples to accurately estimate HIV incidence and the latter are also rarely representative. HIV incidence is thus modelled using the Spectrum software. The software incorporates data on HIV prevalence, the number of people on treatment, demographics and other relevant indicators to estimate historical HIV incidence, among other indicators. A full description of the model is available in peer-reviewed articles and in the most recent UNAIDS Global AIDS Update Reports. &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/17582652/2021/24/S5&quot;&gt;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/17582652/2021/24/S5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
