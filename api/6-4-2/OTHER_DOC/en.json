Among them:</p>\n<p><strong>Understanding AQUASTAT - FAO&apos;s global water information system<br></strong>This information note covers a twenty-year history of the collection and analysis of water-related data and its dissemination as an international public good, freely available to all. The process of collecting and checking the data has resulted in the establishment of a unique network of collaborators who provide data, use data from other countries for comparative purposes, and exchange views and experiences on how best to measure and account for water-related use. Users range from international private companies to non-governmental organizations, and virtually all significant reports related to water depend on the data provided by AQUASTAT.<br><a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc817e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc817e.pdf</a></p>\n<p><strong>Incorporating environmental flows into &#x201C;water stress&#x201D; indicator 6.4.2 - Guidelines for a minimum standard method for global reporting.</strong></p>\n<p>These guidelines are intended to assist countries to participate in the assessment of SDG 6.4.2 on water stress by contributing data and information on environmental flows (EF). They provide a minimum standard method, principally based on the Global Environmental Flows Information System (GEFIS), which is accessible via <a href=\"http://eflows.iwmi.org\">http://eflows.iwmi.org</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.unwater.org/app/uploads/2019/01/SDG6_EF_LOW2.pdf\">https://www.unwater.org/app/uploads/2019/01/SDG6_EF_LOW2.pdf</a></p>\n<p><strong>Renewable Water Resources Assessment - 2015 AQUASTAT methodology review<br></strong><a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc818e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc818e.pdf</a></p>\n<p><strong>Global database on municipal wastewater production, collection, treatment, discharge and direct use in agriculture <br></strong>This paper describes the rationale and method to setup and feed the AQUASTAT database on municipal wastewater production, collection, treatment, discharge or direct use in agriculture. The best available sources of information have been reviewed, including peer-reviewed papers, proceedings of workshops, conferences and expert meetings, global or regional databases, as well as country briefs, national reports and direct communications by country government officials and experts<br><a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc823e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc823e.pdf</a></p>\n<p><strong>Cooling water for energy generation and its impact on national-level water statistics <br></strong>This technical note, describing the issue of cooling water for energy generation and its impact on national-level water statistics, has two purposes: 1) to act as a general informational resource and 2) to encourage governmental agencies responsible for water usage to gather and report information disaggregated by sub-sector (keeping thermoelectric withdrawals separate from industrial and hydroelectric withdrawals), and to determine the point at which lower water withdrawal designs are more favourable, even if the required capital cost is higher.<br><a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc822e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc822e.pdf</a></p>\n<p><strong>Municipal and industrial water withdrawal modelling for the years 2000 and 2005 using statistical methods <br></strong>This document describes the efforts to generate models that estimate the municipal and industrial water withdrawals for the years 2000 and 2005. <br><a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc821e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc821e.pdf</a></p>\n<p><strong>Disambiguation of water statistics <br></strong>The nomenclature surrounding water information is often confusing and gives rise to different interpretations and thus confusion. When discussing the way in which renewable water resources are utilized, the terms water use, usage, withdrawal, consumption, abstraction, extraction, utilization, supply and demand are often used without clearly stating what is meant. <br><a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc816e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc816e.pdf</a></p>\n<p><strong>FAO-AQUASTAT questionnaire on water and agriculture</strong><br>These annual Guidelines and questionnaires have been prepared specifically designed to collect the SDG 6.4. related water variables, and therefore to update the core variables in AQUASTAT database.<br><a href=\"http://www.fao.org/aquastat/en/overview/methodology/\">http://www.fao.org/aquastat/en/overview/methodology/</a> </p>\n<p><strong>International Recommendations for Water Statistics<br></strong>The International Recommendations for Water Statistics (IRWS) were developed to help strengthen national information systems for water in support of design and evaluation of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) policies.<br>https://unstats.un.org/unsd/EconStatKB/KnowledgebaseArticle10209.aspx </p>\n<p><strong>UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics &#x2013; Water Section<br></strong><a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/questionnaire.htm\">http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/questionnaire.htm</a><u><br></u><a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/qindicators.htm\">http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/qindicators.htm</a></p>\n<p><strong>UNSD &#x2018;National Accounts Main Aggregates Database&#x2019;<br></strong><a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/selbasicFast.asp\">http://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/selbasicFast.asp</a></p>\n<p><strong>FAO e-learning course on </strong>SDG Indicator 6.4.2 - Level of water stress: https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=365: <a href=\"https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=475\">https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=475</a> </p>"}
