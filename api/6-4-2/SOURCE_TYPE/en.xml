	<message>The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 6-4-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data for this indicator are usually collected by national ministries and institutions having water-related issues in their mandate, such as national statistic offices, ministries of water resources, agriculture or environment. Official counterparts at country level are the national statistics office and/or the line ministry for water resources and irrigation. More specifically, FAO requests countries to nominate a National Correspondent to act as the focal point for the data collection and communication. Data are mainly published within national statistical yearbooks, national water resources and irrigation master plans and other reports (such as those from projects, international surveys or results and publications from national and international research centres).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
