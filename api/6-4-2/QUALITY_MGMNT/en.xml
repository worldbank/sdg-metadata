	<message>The QUALITY_MGMNT field for indicator 6-4-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First, the annual AQUASTAT questionnaire on water and agriculture, used for collecting information on SDG indicator 6.4.2, was endorsed by FAO&amp;#x2019;s Office of the Chief Statistician (OCS).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;During the reporting process, the OCS provides overall guidance, including on metadata reporting, based on the Metadata Dissemination Standard approved by the FAO IDWG-Statistics Technical Task Force.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data on Environmental flow requirements is re updated only when detailed methodology and metadata reprovided and when consistency in the values is ensured.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After revision and validation, data are submitted to the OCS who also ensures the quality of the data and results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</data>
