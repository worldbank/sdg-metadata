&lt;p&gt;Regional and global estimates will be done by summing up the national figures on renewable freshwater resources and total freshwater withdrawal, considering only the internal renewable water resources of each country in order to avoid double counting, and the external renewable freshwater resources of the region as a whole if any. In case of regional aggregation without physical continuity (such as income groupings or Least Developed Countries group, etc.), total renewable water resources are summed up. The EFR at regional level is estimated as the average of the countries&amp;#x2019; EFRs, in percentage, and applied to the regional water resources.&lt;/p&gt;
