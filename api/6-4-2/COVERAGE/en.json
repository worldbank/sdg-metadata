The contribution of the different sectors to the water stress level is calculated as the proportion of sectoral withdrawals over total freshwater withdrawals, after taking into account the EFR. sectors are defined following the United Nations International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities ISIC 4 coding, </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>agriculture; forestry; fishing (ISIC A), hereinafter &#x201C;agriculture&#x201D;;</li>\n  <li>mining and quarrying; manufacturing; electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply; constructions (ISIC B, C, D and F), hereinafter &#x201C;MIMEC&#x201D;;</li>\n  <li>all the service sectors (ISIC E and ISIC G-T), hereinafter &#x201C;services&#x201D;.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At national level, water resources and withdrawals are estimated or measured at the level of appropriate hydrological units (river basins, aquifers). It is therefore possible to obtain a geographical distribution of water stress by hydrological unit, thus allowing for more targeted response in terms of water demand management.</p>"}
