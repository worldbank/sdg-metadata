	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 6-4-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data needed for the indicator are collected through AQUASTAT for 168 countries worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1961-2019 (Discontinuous, depending on country. Data are interpolated to create timelines.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sectoral disaggregated data are provided to show the respective contribution of the different sectors to the water stress level, and therefore the relative importance of actions needed to contain water demand in the different sectors (agriculture, services and industry). The contribution of the different sectors to the water stress level is calculated as the proportion of sectoral withdrawals over total freshwater withdrawals, after taking into account the EFR. sectors are defined following the United Nations International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities ISIC 4 coding, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;agriculture; forestry; fishing (ISIC A), hereinafter &amp;#x201C;agriculture&amp;#x201D;;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;mining and quarrying; manufacturing; electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply; constructions (ISIC B, C, D and F), hereinafter &amp;#x201C;MIMEC&amp;#x201D;;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;all the service sectors (ISIC E and ISIC G-T), hereinafter &amp;#x201C;services&amp;#x201D;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At national level, water resources and withdrawals are estimated or measured at the level of appropriate hydrological units (river basins, aquifers). It is therefore possible to obtain a geographical distribution of water stress by hydrological unit, thus allowing for more targeted response in terms of water demand management.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
