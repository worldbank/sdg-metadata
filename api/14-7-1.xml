&lt;p&gt;This indicator expresses the value added of sustainable marine capture fisheries as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;u&gt;Gross Domestic Product (GDP)&lt;/u&gt; is the value of all final goods and services produced in an economy in a given period, which is equivalent to the sum of the value added (VA) from all sectors in an economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;u&gt;value added of marine capture fisheries&lt;/u&gt; measures the value of fish harvested from marine stocks, minus the value of goods and services that are used in the production process (such as raw materials and utilities). It includes activities that are normally integrated into the process of production and occur at sea, such as fishing vessels which process or preserve their catch on board. However, it does not include the processing or preserving of fish when it occurs in land based facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;u&gt;fish stock&lt;/u&gt; is a subset of a species (fish, crustacean, mollusc, etc.) or a population inhabiting a geographical area and participating in the same reproductive process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Maximum sustainable yield (MSY)&lt;/u&gt; is the highest theoretical equilibrium yield that can be continuously taken (on average) from a stock under existing (average) environmental conditions without significantly affecting the reproduction process. A stock fished at &lt;u&gt;(MSY)&lt;/u&gt; is referred to as &lt;u&gt;biologically sustainable&lt;/u&gt;, as it may remain stable or grow while sustaining losses from fishing and natural sources of mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;FAO Fishing Areas for Statistical Purposes&lt;/u&gt; are arbitrary areas to facilitate comparison of data, improving the possibilities of cooperation in statistical matters.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-2&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic concepts associated with this indicator are part of the following international instruments and classification schemes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-3&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-3&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This instrument is the basis upon which all the subsequent instruments are built. UNCLOS defines the rights and responsibilities of nations concerning their use of the world&amp;apos;s oceans, establishing guidelines for businesses, the environment, and the management of marine natural resources. It is a binding instrument, although its principles may also be applied by countries who are not a party to it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;The 1995 FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-4&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-4&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This instrument provides the necessary framework for national and international efforts to ensure sustainable exploitation of aquatic living resources in harmony with the environment by establishing principles and standards applicable to the conservation, management, and development of all fisheries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries relies on the concept of MSY when setting general principles and standards for fisheries management. Article 7.2.1 details how management measures should be &amp;#x201C;based on the best scientific evidence available&amp;#x201D; and &amp;#x201C;designed to maintain or restore stocks at levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield, as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors, including the special requirements of developing countries.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;United Nation&amp;#x2019;s International Standard Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-5&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-5&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National accounts data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National accounts data is used for both GDP and the value added of fisheries and aquaculture. This data is obtained from UNSD and OECD databases, both available online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock status:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fish stocks that FAO has monitored since 1974 represent a wide spectrum of data availability, ranging from data-rich and formally assessed stocks to those that have very little information apart from catch statistics by FAO major fishing area and those with no stock assessment at all. For the purposes of using the best available data and information and maintaining consistency among stocks and assessors, a procedure has been defined to identify stock status information (FAO 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAO collects national data through a questionnaire sent to the Principal Focal Point (PFP) of each country. The PFP organises an institutional set-up which identifies the competent authorities to develop a reference list of stocks and completes the questionnaire. The information or data collected through the questionnaire from a country will initially only inform individual country progress. Depending on the evolution and further standardization of country reporting over the next 3-5 years, national data may be used to inform global/regional estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data for GDP and value added is retrieved by FAO from UNSD (or the OECD in case of missing values) once a year every February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAO compiles stock status information biennially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New data for this indicator is expected to be released biennially in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National governmental agencies reporting to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FAO is the sole custodian of indicator 14.7.1, as designated by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goal Indicators (IAEG-SDGs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although target 14.7 promotes the sustainable use of marine resources &amp;#x201C;including of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism&amp;#x201D;, this indicator as selected by the IAEG-SDG focuses only on the sustainable use of marine resources by fisheries. The methodology hereby proposed by FAO thus measures sustainable fisheries as a percentage of GDP, in accordance to the agreed indicator formulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The share of value added from an industry in GDP is commonly used as an indication of its economic importance. Accordingly, the value added of marine capture fisheries indicates the prominence of marine fish related activities in the country&amp;#x2019;s economy and its importance for livelihoods. Both GDP and the VA are measured in constant prices and domestic currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks that are fished at sustainable levels are able to support the communities and industries which rely on them, without compromising reproduction and long-term sustainability. By contrast, a stock that is exploited to a point where it cannot replenish itself will ultimately provide sub-optimal long-term economic returns for stakeholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The status of a fish stock is evaluated through a various processes of assessment that commonly combines biological and statistical information to assess changes in its abundance in response to fishing, which also enables forecasting of future trends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAO has been periodically analysing and compiling the status of marine fish stocks combining the results of formal stock assessments available, including the assessments carried out at the regional level and a finer scale by national institutions and scientific working groups. For stocks that do not have a formal stock assessment, effort is made to collect relevant data and information from the literature, or from local experts, that could be used to infer stock status (for instance trends in catch rates, size frequency distribution of the catch, occasional fishing mortality estimates through surveys, etc.). The information from various sources is analysed and synthesized to classify the exploitation status of fish stocks. FAO monitoring of stocks will be enhanced with the implementation of SDG indicator 14.4.1, which tracks progress towards more fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels at national, regional (across FAO Major Fishing Areas) and global levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on FAO&amp;#x2019;s monitoring of stocks at regional and global level, the percentage of fish resources that are within biologically sustainable levels has exhibited a downward trend from 90 percent in 1974 to 67 percent in 2015, while 33 percent are considered to be overexploited. Overexploitation not only has negative ecological consequences, but also reduces long-term fishery yields, which have adverse social and economic effects, particularly for dependent communities in developing countries and Small Island Developing States (SIDS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indicator measures the value added of sustainable marine capture fisheries as a proportion of GDP. However, the vast majority of countries report only aggregated data for value added for the fisheries and aquaculture sector. To overcome this problem it is necessary to separate the value added for marine capture fisheries from the aggregated data. Preferably this would be done using the value of marine capture fisheries as a proxy. However, in the absence of value data, the quantity of marine capture fisheries as a proportion of total production is used as a proxy for the proportion of value added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For marine capture fisheries, despite the expanded coverage of FAO&amp;#x2019;s assessments in recent years, data deficiencies may lead to uncertainty as to the level of exploitation of a stock. While data limitations exist, the methodology employed by FAO seeks to eliminate discrepancies and provide a representative assessment of marine fish stocks. The time series for which stock assessment is available starts with the first public release of FAO stock assessment, in 2011 for each FAO Major Fishing area. FAO continues to release this information biennially.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-9&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-9&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National fish stock assessments are only available for a few countries, and therefore are not globally or regionally representative. Therefore, the sustainability multiplier used in the compilation of this indicator is based on the average fish stock sustainability calculated by FAO for each Major Fishing Area. For each country, the sustainability multiplier will be the average sustainability weighted by the proportion of the quantity of marine capture for each respective fishing area in which the country performs fishing activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, FAO aims to begin compiling country-level estimates for SDG indicator 14.4.1 (proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels) in 2020. Once these estimates become available, the computation method for the current indicator will use country-level estimates rather than estimates based on FAO Major Fishing Areas to determine the sustainability multiplier and hence estimate the value added of sustainable marine capture fisheries as a proportion of GDP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-9&quot;&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; The most recent version of Review of the State of World Marine Fishery Resources which contains stock status is available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-9&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method of computation for 14.7.1 differs depending on the availability of data. Method 1 outlines the steps for calculating 14.7.1 using national sustainability. Method 2 gives the steps for calculating 14.7.1 using proxy regional sustainability data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Method 1: When national sustainability data is available from 14.4.1, the contribution of sustainable marine capture fisheries to GDP is calculated as follows &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The percentage contribution of fisheries and aquaculture to GDP is estimated by simply dividing the value added of fisheries and aquaculture by national GDP.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;In order to disaggregate for the value added of marine capture fisheries and the value added of aquaculture, the quantity of fish produced from marine capture fisheries will be divided by total quantity of national production of fish, and then multiplied by the percentage of GDP from fisheries and aquaculture. As such, the quantity of production of marine capture fisheries is used as a proxy for the value of marine capture fisheries.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method 2: When national sustainability data is not available from 14.4.1, the contribution of sustainable marine capture fisheries to GDP is calculated as follows using proxy regional sustainability data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The percentage contribution of fisheries and aquaculture to GDP is estimated by simply dividing the value added of fisheries and aquaculture by national GDP.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;In order to disaggregate for the value added of marine capture fisheries and the value added of aquaculture, the quantity of fish produced from marine capture fisheries will be divided by total quantity of national production of fish, and then multiplied by the percentage of GDP from fisheries and aquaculture. As such, the quantity of production of marine capture fisheries is used as a proxy for the value of marine capture fisheries.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;The sustainability multiplier will be calculated based on the average sustainability published periodically for each FAO major marine fishing area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each country, the sustainability multiplier will be the average sustainability weighted by the proportion of the quantity of marine capture for each respective fishing area in which the country performs fishing activities. When a country fishes in only one FAO fishing area, its sustainability multiplier will be equal to the average sustainability of stocks in that area.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/mrow&gt;
    &lt;/mfenced&gt;
  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The methodology relies on information which is already provided by countries or published by FAO. National statistical systems are the primary providers of data for each aspect of the indicator. Value added and GDP data are collected and validated by the countries themselves. All inputs are reviewed for consistency prior to calculation of the indicator to ensure the consistency of figures and methodologies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National accounts data is harmonised to ensure that figures for GDP and the value added of fisheries and aquaculture are obtained from the same ISIC review and System of National Accounts (SNA) series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At country level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator examines economic contribution from marine capture fisheries. If a country has no marine capture fisheries then the indicator is not calculated for that country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No imputation is performed to derive estimates for countries or years when the value added of fisheries and aquaculture is not available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAO employs a wide spectrum of data and analysis to assess 500 fish stocks, which accounts for 70&amp;#x2013;80 percent of global landings. A detailed description of the approach used by FAO is available at the Review of the State of World Marine Fishery Resources.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-10&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-10&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If national estimates of fish stocks are not available from SDG 14.4.1 , then regional stock status will be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At regional and global level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not applicable. Regional aggregates will only be calculated based on contribution of sustainable fisheries to the GDP of those countries that have reported value added for fishing and aquaculture in a given year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-10&quot;&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; The most recent version of Review of the State of World Marine Fishery Resources is available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-10&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regional and global aggregates will be generated by taking the average value of the indicator for countries in each SDG region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When interpreting regional aggregates, it is important to consider that a country&amp;#x2019;s geographic region is not necessarily indicative of how or where it fishes. Countries may fish in completely different fishing areas from others in their region, and therefore land-based regional aggregates can be inappropriate when dealing with marine resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All data used in the calculation of this indicator is drawn from already available international sources. As such there is no additional reporting burden for countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;N/A&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to provide continuity of collection of data for value added for fisheries and aquaculture, and GDP across different versions of the Systems of National Accounts (SNA) and ISIC revisions, FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Department ensures its consistency by the use of backwards and forwards linkages when collecting and validating the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While SDG indicator 14.7.1 is completely constructed on data already provided by countries to FAO, to the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) and to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), countries are invited to collaborate with FAO to increase the precision of their results, by providing otherwise unavailable inputs for the calculation of the indicator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indicator provides a clear framework for monitoring countries&amp;#x2019; progress towards target 14.7. Inputs are robust, standardised, globally recognised and available for a wide range of countries, including many developing nations. As such there is comprehensive coverage for the majority of countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be variation in the completeness of nationally reported data. Improvements in data collection by national statistics systems may improve the accuracy of this indicator. When regional stock status is used in the calculation of this indicator it may not fully reflect the sustainability of national fisheries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data availability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator may be calculated based on currently available data for 128 countries which have marine capture fisheries and have reported the value added of fisheries and aquaculture at least once since 2011. This includes 35 SIDS, 68 developing countries and 23 least developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently there are no disaggregation dimensions for this indicator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock status taken from 14.4.1 is estimated by FAO based on the methodologies developed in the 1980s. Although regular updates were carried out to incorporate technical advances and changes in major fish species, some discrepancies between regions may occur in the representativeness of the reference list in practical fisheries. However, this will not pose a large impact on the reliability of the indicator&amp;#x2019;s temporal trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Sustainable Development Goal 14.7.1: http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators/1471/en&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vínculos con otros objetivos y metas: ODS 1, ODS 2, ODS 8 (en particular 8.1 y 8.4), ODS 12, ODS 13, ODS 14 (en particular 14.4.1)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Información institucional&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; &lt;strong&gt; Organización: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Agricultura y la Alimentación (FAO)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Conceptos y definiciones &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Definiciones: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Este indicador expresa el valor agregado de la pesca de captura marina sostenible como proporción del Producto Interior Bruto (PIB). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Conceptos: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; El &lt;u&gt; Producto Interno Bruto (PIB) &lt;/u&gt; es el valor de todos los bienes y servicios finales producidos en una economía en un período determinado, que es equivalente a la suma del valor agregado (VA) de todos los sectores en una economía. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; El &lt;u&gt; valor agregado de la pesca de captura marina &lt;/u&gt; mide el valor del pescado extraído de las poblaciones marinas, menos el valor de los bienes y servicios que se utilizan en el proceso de producción (como materias primas y servicios públicos). Incluye actividades que normalmente están integradas en el proceso de producción y ocurren en el mar, como los buques pesqueros que procesan o conservan sus capturas a bordo. Sin embargo, no incluye la elaboración o conservación de pescado cuando se produce en instalaciones terrestres. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Una &lt;u&gt; población de peces &lt;/u&gt; es un subconjunto de una especie (peces, crustáceos, moluscos, etc.) o una población que habita una zona geográfica y participa en el mismo proceso de reproducción. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;u&gt; Rendimiento máximo sostenible (RMS) &lt;/u&gt; es el rendimiento de equilibrio teórico más alto que puede obtenerse continuamente (en promedio) de una población en condiciones ambientales (promedio) existentes sin afectar significativamente el proceso de reproducción. Una población capturada a &lt;u&gt; (RMS) &lt;/u&gt; se denomina &lt;u&gt; biológicamente sostenible &lt;/u&gt;, ya que puede permanecer estable o crecer mientras sufre pérdidas por pesca y fuentes naturales de mortalidad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;u&gt; Las zonas de pesca de la FAO con fines estadísticos &lt;/u&gt; son zonas arbitrarias para facilitar la comparación de datos, mejorando las posibilidades de cooperación en materia estadística. &lt;sup&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-1&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-1&quot;&gt; [1] &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Los conceptos básicos asociados a este indicador forman parte de los siguientes instrumentos internacionales y esquemas de clasificación: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;u&gt; La Convención de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Derecho del Mar de 1982 (CONVEMAR) &lt;sup&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-2&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt; [2] &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/u&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt; Este instrumento es la base sobre la que se construyen todos los instrumentos posteriores. La CONVEMAR define los derechos y responsabilidades de las naciones con respecto a su uso de los océanos del mundo, estableciendo directrices para las empresas, el medio ambiente y la gestión de los recursos naturales marinos. Es un instrumento vinculante, aunque sus principios también pueden ser aplicados por países que no son parte en él. &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;u&gt; El Código de Conducta para la Pesca Responsable (CCPR) de la FAO de 1995 &lt;sup&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-3&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-3&quot;&gt; [3] &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/u&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt; Este instrumento proporciona el marco necesario para los esfuerzos nacionales e internacionales para asegurar la explotación sostenible de los recursos acuáticos vivos en armonía con el medio ambiente mediante el establecimiento de principios y normas aplicables a la conservación, ordenación y desarrollo de todas las pesquerías. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt; El Código de Conducta para la Pesca Responsable de la FAO se basa en el concepto de RMS al establecer principios y normas generales para la ordenación pesquera. En el artículo 7.2.1 se detalla cómo las medidas de ordenación deben basarse &amp;#x201C; en las mejores pruebas científicas disponibles &amp;#x201D; y &amp;#x201C; diseñadas para mantener o restaurar las poblaciones a niveles capaces de producir el rendimiento máximo sostenible, calificado por los factores ambientales y económicos pertinentes, incluidas las necesidades especiales de los países en desarrollo. &amp;#x201D; &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Recopilación de datos:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; La FAO recupera datos sobre el PIB y el valor agregado de la UNSD (o de la OCDE en caso de que falten valores) una vez al año cada mes de febrero. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; La FAO recopila y publica información sobre el estado de las existencias cada dos años en la publicación SOFIA. Cuando los datos notificados por los países para el indicador 14.4.1 de los ODS (&amp;#x201C;proporción de las poblaciones de peces dentro de los niveles biológicamente sostenibles&amp;#x201D;) estén disponibles, se utilizarán para sustituir el actual multiplicador de sostenibilidad del indicador 14.7.1 de los ODS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Publicación de datos: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Se espera que los nuevos datos para este indicador se publiquen cada dos años en marzo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Proveedores de datos&lt;/h1&gt;

  &lt;li&gt; La Organización de Cooperación y Desarrollo Económicos (OCDE). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Compiladores de datos&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Agricultura y la Alimentación. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Justificación:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aunque la meta 14.7 promueve el uso sostenible de los recursos marinos &amp;#x201C; incluidos los de la pesca, la acuicultura y el turismo&amp;#x201D;, este indicador, tal como fue seleccionado por el IAEG-ODS, se centra únicamente en el uso sostenible de los recursos marinos por parte de la pesca. Así pues, la metodología propuesta por la FAO mide la pesca sostenible como porcentaje del PIB, de conformidad con la formulación de indicadores acordada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; La participación del valor agregado de una industria en el PIB se utiliza comúnmente como indicación de su importancia económica. En consecuencia, el valor agregado de la pesca de captura marina indica la prominencia de las actividades relacionadas con la pesca marina en la economía del país y su importancia para los medios de vida. Tanto el PIB como el VA se miden en precios constantes y en moneda nacional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Las poblaciones que se pescan a niveles sostenibles pueden apoyar a las comunidades e industrias que dependen de ellas, sin comprometer la reproducción y la sostenibilidad a largo plazo. Por el contrario, una población que se explota hasta un punto en el que no puede reponerse por sí misma proporcionará en última instancia rendimientos económicos a largo plazo subóptimos para las partes interesadas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; El estado de una población de peces se evalúa a través de varios procesos de evaluación que comúnmente combinan información biológica y estadística para evaluar los cambios en su abundancia en respuesta a la pesca, lo que también permite predecir las tendencias futuras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; La FAO ha estado analizando y compilando periódicamente la situación de las poblaciones de peces marinos combinando los resultados de las evaluaciones oficiales de las poblaciones disponibles, incluidas las evaluaciones realizadas a nivel regional y una escala más fina por las instituciones nacionales y los grupos de trabajo científicos. En el caso de las poblaciones que no tienen una evaluación oficial de las poblaciones, se hace un esfuerzo por recopilar datos e información pertinentes de la bibliografía, o de expertos locales, que podrían utilizarse para inferir el estado de las poblaciones (por ejemplo, las tendencias en las tasas de captura, la distribución de la frecuencia del tamaño de las capturas, las estimaciones ocasionales de la mortalidad por pesca mediante encuestas, etc.). La información procedente de diversas fuentes se analiza y sintetiza para clasificar el estado de explotación de las poblaciones de peces. El seguimiento de las poblaciones de peces por parte de la FAO se mejorará con la aplicación del indicador 14.4.1 de los ODS, que hace un seguimiento del progreso hacia un mayor aumento de las poblaciones de peces dentro de niveles biológicamente sostenibles a nivel nacional, regional (en las principales zonas de pesca de la FAO) y mundial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sobre la base del monitoreo de las poblaciones de la FAO a nivel regional y mundial, el porcentaje de recursos pesqueros que se encuentran dentro de niveles biológicamente sostenibles ha mostrado una tendencia a la baja del 90 por ciento en 1974 al 67 por ciento en 2015, mientras que el 33 por ciento se considera sobreexplotado. La sobreexplotación no sólo tiene consecuencias ecológicas negativas, sino que también reduce los rendimientos de la pesca a largo plazo, que tienen efectos sociales y económicos adversos, en particular para las comunidades dependientes de los países en desarrollo y los pequeños Estados insulares en desarrollo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Comentarios y limitaciones:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; El indicador mide el valor agregado de la pesca de captura marina sostenible como proporción del PIB. Sin embargo, la gran mayoría de los países sólo reportan datos agregados de valor agregado para el sector de la pesca y la acuicultura. Para superar este problema es necesario separar el valor agregado para la pesca de captura marina de los datos agregados. Preferiblemente, esto se haría utilizando el valor de la pesca de captura marina como sustituto. Sin embargo, a falta de datos sobre el valor, la cantidad de pesca de captura marina como proporción de la producción total se utiliza como indicador de la proporción de valor agregado. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; En el ámbito de la pesca de captura marina, a pesar de la ampliación de la cobertura de las evaluaciones de la FAO en los últimos años, las deficiencias de los datos pueden dar lugar a incertidumbre en cuanto al nivel de explotación de una población. Si bien existen limitaciones de datos, la metodología empleada por la FAO trata de eliminar las discrepancias y proporcionar una evaluación representativa de las poblaciones de peces marinos. La serie temporal para la que se dispone de una evaluación de las poblaciones comienza con la primera publicación de la evaluación de las poblaciones de la FAO, en 2011, para cada zona de pesca importante de la FAO. La FAO sigue divulgando esta información cada dos años. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-8&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-8&quot;&gt; [8] &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Las evaluaciones nacionales de las poblaciones de peces sólo están disponibles para unos pocos países y, por lo tanto, no son representativas a nivel mundial o regional. Por lo tanto, el multiplicador de sostenibilidad utilizado en la compilación de este indicador se basa en la sostenibilidad media de las poblaciones de peces calculada por la FAO para cada zona de pesca importante. Para cada país, el multiplicador de sostenibilidad será la sostenibilidad promedio ponderada por la proporción de la cantidad de captura marina para cada zona de pesca respectiva en la que el país realiza actividades pesqueras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Actualmente, la FAO tiene como objetivo comenzar a compilar estimaciones a nivel de país para el indicador 14.4.1 de los ODS (proporción de poblaciones de peces dentro de niveles biológicamente sostenibles) en 2020. Una vez que estas estimaciones estén disponibles, el método de cálculo para el indicador actual utilizará estimaciones a nivel de país en lugar de estimaciones basadas en las principales zonas de pesca de la FAO para determinar el multiplicador de sostenibilidad y, por lo tanto, estimar el valor agregado de la pesca de captura marina sostenible como proporción del PIB. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; La versión más reciente de Examen del estado de los recursos pesqueros marinos mundiales que contiene el estado de las poblaciones está disponible en &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-8&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Metodología&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nivel de país, la contribución de la pesca de captura marina sostenible al PIB se calcula de la siguiente manera:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) La contribución porcentual de la pesca y la acuicultura al PIB se estima simplemente dividiendo el valor agregado de la pesca y la acuicultura por el PIB nacional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PIB de la pesca y la acuicultura (%) = valor agregado de la pesca y la acuicultura/PIB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PIB&lt;sub&gt;PA&lt;/sub&gt; = VA&lt;sub&gt;PA&lt;/sub&gt;/PIB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) A fin de desglosar por el valor agregado de la pesca de captura marina y el valor agregado de la acuicultura, la cantidad de pescado producido a partir de la pesca de captura marina se dividirá por la cantidad total de producción nacional de pescado, y luego se multiplicará por el porcentaje del PIB de la pesca y la acuicultura. Como tal, la cantidad de producción de la pesca de captura marina se utiliza como un indicador del valor de la pesca de captura marina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valor agregado del proxy de pesca de captura marina (%) =&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PIB de Pesca y Acuicultura x (Cantidad de Pesca de Captura Marina/Cantidad Total de Pescado)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;VA&lt;sub&gt;P &lt;/sub&gt;= PIB&lt;sub&gt;PA&lt;/sub&gt; x (Q&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;/Q&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c) El multiplicador de sostenibilidad se calculará sobre la base de la sostenibilidad media publicada periódicamente para cada una de las principales zonas de pesca marina de la FAO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Para cada país, el multiplicador de sostenibilidad será la sostenibilidad promedio ponderada por la proporción de la cantidad de captura marina para cada área de pesca respectiva en la que el país realiza actividades pesqueras. Cuando un país pesca en una sola zona de pesca de la FAO, su multiplicador de sostenibilidad será igual a la sostenibilidad media de las poblaciones de peces en esa zona. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actualmente no hay dimensiones de desagregación para este indicador. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Tratamiento de valores faltantes:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt; A nivel de país:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Este indicador examina la contribución económica de la pesca de captura marina. Si un país no tiene pesquerías de captura marina, entonces el indicador no se calcula para ese país. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; No se realiza ninguna imputación para obtener estimaciones para países o años en los que no se dispone del valor agregado de la pesca y la acuicultura. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; La FAO emplea un amplio espectro de datos y análisis para evaluar 500 poblaciones de peces, que representan el 70&amp;#x2013;80 por ciento de las capturas mundiales. Una descripción detallada del enfoque utilizado por la FAO está disponible en el Examen del estado de los recursos pesqueros marinos mundiales. &lt;sup&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-9&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-9&quot;&gt; [9] &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt; A nivel regional y mundial:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; No procede. Los agregados regionales solo se calcularán sobre la base de la contribución de la pesca sostenible al PIB de los países que hayan notificado valor agregado para la pesca y la acuicultura en un año determinado. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; La versión más reciente de Examen del estado de los recursos pesqueros marinos mundiales está disponible en &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-9&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Agregados regionales y globales:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Los agregados regionales y mundiales se generarán tomando el valor promedio del indicador para los países de cada región de los ODS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Al interpretar los agregados regionales, es importante tener en cuenta que la región geográfica de un país no es necesariamente indicativa de cómo o dónde pesca. Los países pueden pescar en zonas de pesca completamente diferentes de otras de su región y, por lo tanto, los agregados regionales terrestres pueden ser inadecuados cuando se trata de recursos marinos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Garantía de calidad:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Con el fin de proporcionar continuidad a la recopilación de datos sobre el valor agregado para la pesca y la acuicultura, y el PIB en las diferentes versiones de los Sistemas de Cuentas Nacionales (SCN) y las revisiones de la CIIU, el Departamento de Pesca y Acuicultura de la FAO garantiza su coherencia mediante el uso de vínculos hacia atrás y hacia adelante al recopilar y validar la información. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Si bien el indicador 14.7.1 de los ODS se basa completamente en datos ya proporcionados por los países a la FAO, a la División de Estadística de las Naciones Unidas y a la Organización de Cooperación y Desarrollo Económicos (OCDE), se invita a los países a colaborar con la FAO para aumentar la precisión de sus resultados, proporcionando insumos que de otro modo no estarían disponibles para el cálculo del indicador. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Disponibilidad de los datos&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Descripción:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; El indicador puede calcularse sobre la base de los datos actualmente disponibles para 128 países que tienen pesquerías de captura marina y que han notificado el valor añadido de la pesca y la acuicultura al menos una vez desde 2011. Esto incluye a 35 pequeños Estados insulares en desarrollo, 68 países en desarrollo y 23 países menos adelantados. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Desglose de la disponibilidad de datos de países por región, a partir de 2011:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liens avec d&apos;autres objectifs et cibles : ODD 1, ODD 2, ODD 8 (en particulier 8.1 et 8.4), ODD 12, ODD 13, ODD 14 (en particulier 14.4.1)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organisation des Nations unies pour l&apos;alimentation et l&apos;agriculture (FAO)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organisation des Nations unies pour l&apos;alimentation et l&apos;agriculture (FAO)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Concepts et définitions &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Définitions : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cet indicateur exprime la valeur ajoutée des pêches de capture marines durables en tant que proportion du produit intérieur brut (PIB). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le &lt;u&gt;Produit intérieur brut (PIB)&lt;/u&gt; est la valeur de tous les biens et services finaux produits dans une économie au cours d&apos;une période donnée, ce qui équivaut à la somme de la valeur ajoutée (VA) de tous les secteurs d&apos;une économie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La &lt;u&gt;valeur ajoutée des pêches de capture marines&lt;/u&gt; mesure la valeur du poisson récolté dans les stocks marins, moins la valeur des biens et services utilisés dans le processus de production (tels que les matières premières et les services publics). Elle inclut les activités qui sont normalement intégrées au processus de production et qui ont lieu en mer, comme les navires de pêche qui traitent ou conservent leurs prises à bord. Toutefois, elle ne comprend pas la transformation ou la conservation du poisson lorsqu&apos;elle a lieu dans des installations terrestres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Un &lt;u&gt;stock de poissons&lt;/u&gt; est un sous-ensemble d&apos;une espèce (poisson, crustacé, mollusque, etc.) ou une population habitant une zone géographique et participant au même processus de reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Le rendement maximal durable (RMD)&lt;/u&gt; est le rendement d&apos;équilibre théorique le plus élevé qui peut être prélevé en continu (en moyenne) sur un stock dans les conditions environnementales existantes (moyennes) sans affecter de manière significative le processus de reproduction. Un stock pêché au &lt;u&gt;(RMD)&lt;/u&gt; est qualifié de &lt;u&gt;biologiquement durable&lt;/u&gt;, car il peut rester stable ou croître tout en subissant des pertes dues à la pêche et aux sources naturelles de mortalité.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Les zones de pêche de la FAO à des fins statistiques&lt;/u&gt; sont des zones arbitraires destinées à faciliter la comparaison des données, améliorant ainsi les possibilités de coopération en matière de statistiques&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-1&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les concepts de base associés à cet indicateur font partie des instruments internationaux et des systèmes de classification suivants :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;La Convention des Nations Unies sur le droit de la mer de 1982 (UNCLOS)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-2&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cet instrument est la base sur laquelle sont construits tous les instruments ultérieurs. L&apos;UNCLOS définit les droits et les responsabilités des nations concernant leur utilisation des océans du monde, et établit des lignes directrices pour les entreprises, l&apos;environnement et la gestion des ressources naturelles marines. Il s&apos;agit d&apos;un instrument contraignant, bien que ses principes puissent également être appliqués par des pays qui n&apos;y sont pas parties&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Le Code de conduite pour une pêche responsable (CCRF) de la FAO de 1995&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-3&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cet instrument fournit le cadre nécessaire aux efforts nationaux et internationaux visant à assurer une exploitation durable des ressources aquatiques vivantes en harmonie avec l&apos;environnement, en établissant des principes et des normes applicables à la conservation, à la gestion et au développement de toutes les pêches&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Le Code de conduite pour une pêche responsable de la FAO s&apos;appuie sur le concept de RMD lorsqu&apos;il établit les principes et les normes générales de gestion des pêches.  L&apos;article 7.2.1 explique en détail comment les mesures d&apos;aménagement doivent être &amp;#x201C ;fondées sur les meilleures données scientifiques disponibles&amp;#x201D ; et &amp;#x201C ;conçues pour maintenir ou rétablir les stocks à des niveaux permettant d&apos;obtenir un rendement maximal durable, compte tenu des facteurs environnementaux et économiques pertinents, y compris les besoins particuliers des pays en développement&amp;#x201D ;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;La Classification internationale type de toutes les activités économiques (CITI) des Nations Unies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-4&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Toutes les composantes des pêches de capture marines sont clairement définies dans la section A 0311 révision de la CITI &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-1&quot;&gt;1 &lt;/sup&gt; &lt;p&gt; zones de pêche de la FAO à des fins statistiques : &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http ://www.fao.org/cwp-on-fishery-statistics/handbook/general-concepts/major-fishing-areas-general/en/&quot;&gt;http ://www.fao.org/cwp-on-fishery-statistics/handbook/general-concepts/major-fishing-areas-general/en/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-1&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191 ;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; UNCLOS : &lt;a href=&quot;http ://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf&quot;&gt;http ://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191 ;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; CCRF : &lt;a href=&quot;http ://www.fao.org/3/v9878e/V9878E.pdf&quot;&gt;http ://www.fao.org/3/v9878e/V9878E.pdf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-3&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191 ;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; CITI révision 4 : &lt;a href=&quot;https ://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/seriesm/seriesm_4rev4e.pdf&quot;&gt;https ://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/seriesm/seriesm_4rev4e.pdf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-4&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191 ;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Sources de données &lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Les séries de données sur la valeur ajoutée de la pêche et de l&apos;aquaculture et le PIB sont dérivées des données officielles par pays des comptes nationaux de la DSNU. En cas de valeurs manquantes, des données supplémentaires sont extraites de la base de données des comptes nationaux annuels de l&apos;OCDE. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Collecte des données :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les données relatives au PIB et à la valeur ajoutée sont récupérées par la FAO auprès de l&apos;UNSD (ou de l&apos;OCDE en cas de valeurs manquantes) une fois par an, en février.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; La FAO compile et publie des informations sur l&apos;état des stocks tous les deux ans dans la publication SOFIA. Lorsque les données communiquées par les pays pour l&apos;indicateur 14.4.1 de l&apos;ODD (&amp;#x201C;proportion de stocks de poissons se situant dans des limites biologiquement viables&amp;#x201D;) seront disponibles, elles seront utilisées pour remplacer le multiplicateur de viabilité actuel pour l&apos;indicateur 14.7.1 de l&apos;ODD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Publication des données :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les nouvelles données pour cet indicateur devraient être publiées tous les deux ans en mars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Fournisseurs de données &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agences gouvernementales nationales relevant de :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organisation des Nations Unies pour l&apos;alimentation et l&apos;agriculture (FAO).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Division de la statistique des Nations Unies (UNSD). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;L&apos;Organisation de coopération et de développement économiques (OCDE).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Compilateurs de données &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organisation des Nations Unies pour l&apos;alimentation et l&apos;agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Justification : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bien que la cible 14.7 encourage l&apos;utilisation durable des ressources marines &amp;#x201C;y compris de la pêche, de l&apos;aquaculture et du tourisme &amp;#x201D;, cet indicateur, tel qu&apos;il a été sélectionné par le GIAE-GSS, se concentre uniquement sur l&apos;utilisation durable des ressources marines par la pêche. La méthodologie proposée ici par la FAO mesure donc la pêche durable en pourcentage du PIB, conformément à la formulation convenue de l&apos;indicateur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La part de la valeur ajoutée d&apos;une industrie dans le PIB est généralement utilisée comme une indication de son importance économique. En conséquence, la valeur ajoutée des pêches de capture marines indique la prédominance des activités liées aux poissons marins dans l&apos;économie du pays et son importance pour les moyens de subsistance. Le PIB et la VA sont tous deux mesurés en prix constants et en monnaie nationale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les stocks qui sont pêchés à des niveaux durables sont capables de soutenir les communautés et les industries qui en dépendent, sans compromettre la reproduction et la durabilité à long terme. En revanche, un stock qui est exploité à un point tel qu&apos;il ne peut pas se reconstituer fournira en fin de compte des rendements économiques à long terme sous-optimaux pour les parties prenantes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L&apos;état d&apos;un stock de poissons est évalué par divers processus d&apos;évaluation qui combinent généralement des informations biologiques et statistiques pour évaluer les changements dans son abondance en réponse à la pêche, ce qui permet également de prévoir les tendances futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La FAO analyse et compile périodiquement l&apos;état des stocks de poissons marins en combinant les résultats des évaluations officielles disponibles, y compris les évaluations effectuées au niveau régional et à une échelle plus fine par des institutions nationales et des groupes de travail scientifiques. Pour les stocks qui n&apos;ont pas fait l&apos;objet d&apos;une évaluation formelle, on s&apos;efforce de collecter des données et des informations pertinentes dans la littérature ou auprès d&apos;experts locaux, qui pourraient être utilisées pour déduire l&apos;état du stock (par exemple, les tendances des taux de capture, la distribution de la fréquence des tailles de la capture, les estimations occasionnelles de la mortalité par pêche grâce aux enquêtes, etc.) Les informations provenant de diverses sources sont analysées et synthétisées pour classer l&apos;état d&apos;exploitation des stocks de poissons. Le suivi des stocks par la FAO sera renforcé par la mise en œuvre de l&apos;indicateur 14.4.1 de l&apos;ODD, qui permet de suivre les progrès accomplis pour accroître les stocks de poissons à des niveaux biologiquement viables aux niveaux national, régional (dans les principales zones de pêche de la FAO) et mondial&lt;/p&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;D&apos;après le suivi des stocks de la FAO aux niveaux régional et mondial, le pourcentage des ressources halieutiques qui se situent dans des niveaux biologiquement durables a connu une tendance à la baisse, passant de 90 pour cent en 1974 à 67 pour cent en 2015, tandis que 33 pour cent sont considérés comme surexploités. La surexploitation a non seulement des conséquences écologiques négatives, mais elle réduit également les rendements halieutiques à long terme, ce qui a des effets sociaux et économiques néfastes, notamment pour les communautés dépendantes des pays en développement et des petits États insulaires en développement (PEID).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Commentaires et limites :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L&apos;indicateur mesure la valeur ajoutée des pêches de capture marines durables en tant que proportion du PIB. Cependant, la grande majorité des pays ne communiquent que des données agrégées sur la valeur ajoutée du secteur de la pêche et de l&apos;aquaculture. Pour surmonter ce problème, il est nécessaire de séparer la valeur ajoutée des pêches de capture marines des données agrégées. Il serait préférable de le faire en utilisant la valeur des pêches de capture marines comme approximation. Toutefois, en l&apos;absence de données sur la valeur, la quantité de pêches de capture marine par rapport à la production totale est utilisée comme approximation de la proportion de valeur ajoutée.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pour les pêches de capture marines, malgré la couverture élargie des évaluations de la FAO ces dernières années, les insuffisances des données peuvent conduire à une incertitude quant au niveau d&apos;exploitation d&apos;un stock. Bien que les données soient limitées, la méthodologie employée par la FAO cherche à éliminer les divergences et à fournir une évaluation représentative des stocks de poissons marins. La série chronologique pour laquelle l&apos;évaluation des stocks est disponible commence avec la première publication de l&apos;évaluation des stocks de la FAO, en 2011, pour chaque zone de pêche majeure de la FAO. La FAO continue de publier ces informations tous les deux ans.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-8&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-8&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Les évaluations nationales des stocks de poissons ne sont disponibles que pour quelques pays, et ne sont donc pas représentatives au niveau mondial ou régional. Par conséquent, le multiplicateur de durabilité utilisé dans la compilation de cet indicateur est basé sur la durabilité moyenne des stocks de poissons calculée par la FAO pour chaque zone de pêche majeure. Pour chaque pays, le multiplicateur de durabilité sera la durabilité moyenne pondérée par la proportion de la quantité de capture marine pour chaque zone de pêche respective dans laquelle le pays exerce des activités de pêche. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Actuellement, la FAO vise à commencer à compiler les estimations au niveau des pays pour l&apos;indicateur ODD 14.4.1 (proportion des stocks de poissons dans des niveaux biologiquement durables) en 2020. Une fois que ces estimations seront disponibles, la méthode de calcul de l&apos;indicateur actuel utilisera les estimations au niveau national plutôt que les estimations basées sur les principales zones de pêche de la FAO pour déterminer le multiplicateur de durabilité et donc estimer la valeur ajoutée des pêches de capture marines durables en tant que proportion du PIB. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; La version la plus récente de l&apos;Examen de l&apos;état des ressources halieutiques marines mondiales, qui contient l&apos;état des stocks, est disponible à l&apos;adresse suivante : &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf &lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-8&quot;&gt; &amp;#x2191; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Méthodologie&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A l&apos;échelle d&apos;un pays, la contribution des pêches de capture marines durables au PIB est calculée comme suit :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) La contribution en pourcentage de la pêche et de l&apos;aquaculture au PIB est estimée en divisant simplement la valeur ajoutée de la pêche et de l&apos;aquaculture par le PIB national.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PIB de la pêche et de l&apos;aquaculture (%) = Valeur ajoutée de la pêche et de l&apos;aquaculture/PIB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PIB&lt;sub&gt;FIA&lt;/sub&gt; = VA&lt;sub&gt;FIA&lt;/sub&gt;/GDP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) Afin de désagréger pour la valeur ajoutée des pêches de capture marines et la valeur ajoutée de l&apos;aquaculture, la quantité de poisson produite par les pêches de capture marines sera divisée par la quantité totale de la production nationale de poisson, puis multipliée par le pourcentage du PIB provenant de la pêche et de l&apos;aquaculture. Ainsi, la quantité de production des pêches de capture marines est utilisée comme une approximation de la valeur des pêches de capture marines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valeur ajoutée des pêches de capture marines proxy (%) = &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PIB de la pêche et de l&apos;aquaculture x (quantité de pêches de capture marine/quantité totale de poissons)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;VA&lt;sub&gt;F &lt;/sub&gt;= PIB&lt;sub&gt;Pêche&lt;/sub&gt; x (Q&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;/Q&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c) Le multiplicateur de durabilité sera calculé sur la base de la durabilité moyenne publiée périodiquement pour chaque grande zone de pêche marine de la FAO. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Pour chaque pays, le multiplicateur de durabilité sera la durabilité moyenne pondérée par la proportion de la quantité de capture marine pour chaque zone de pêche respective dans laquelle le pays exerce des activités de pêche. Lorsqu&apos;un pays ne pêche que dans une seule zone de pêche de la FAO, son multiplicateur de durabilité sera égal à la durabilité moyenne des stocks de cette zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiplicateur de durabilité = Somme de (Durabilité pour chaque région x ((Quantité pêchée dans chaque région marine/Quantité totale pêchée dans toutes les régions marines)).&lt;/p&gt;

Les agrégats régionaux ne seront calculés que sur la base de la contribution de la pêche durable au PIB des pays qui ont déclaré une valeur ajoutée pour la pêche et l&apos;aquaculture au cours d&apos;une année donnée. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-9&quot;&gt;9 &lt;/sup&gt; &lt;p&gt; La version la plus récente de l&apos;Examen de l&apos;état des ressources halieutiques marines mondiales est disponible à l&apos;adresse suivante : &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf &lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-9&quot;&gt; &amp;#x2191; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Agrégats régionaux et mondiaux :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les agrégats régionaux et mondiaux seront générés en prenant la valeur moyenne de l&apos;indicateur pour les pays dans chaque région de l&apos;ODD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lors de l&apos;interprétation des agrégats régionaux, il est important de considérer que la région géographique d&apos;un pays indique pas nécessairement comment ou où il pêche. Les pays peuvent pêcher dans des zones de pêche complètement différentes de celles des autres pays de leur région, et par conséquent, les agrégats régionaux basés sur la terre peuvent être inappropriés lorsqu&apos;il s&apos;agit de ressources marines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Assurance qualité : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afin d&apos;assurer la continuité de la collecte des données sur la valeur ajoutée de la pêche et de l&apos;aquaculture et sur le PIB entre les différentes versions du Système de comptabilité nationale (SCN) et les révisions de la CITI, le Département des pêches et de l&apos;aquaculture de la FAO veille à leur cohérence en utilisant des liens en amont et en aval lors de la collecte et de la validation des informations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bien que l&apos;indicateur 14.7.1 des ODD soit entièrement construit à partir des données déjà fournies par les pays à la FAO, à la Division des statistiques des Nations Unies (UNSD) et à l&apos;Organisation de coopération et de développement économiques (OCDE), les pays sont invités à collaborer avec la FAO pour accroître la précision de leurs résultats, en fournissant des données autrement non disponibles pour le calcul de l&apos;indicateur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Disponibilité des données &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L&apos;indicateur peut être calculé sur la base des données actuellement disponibles pour 128 pays qui ont des pêches de capture marines et ont déclaré la valeur ajoutée des pêches et de l&apos;aquaculture au moins une fois depuis 2011. Cela inclut 35 PEID, 68 pays en développement et 23 pays les moins avancés.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Связь с другими целями и задачами: ЦУР 1, ЦУР 2, ЦУР 8 (в частности, 8.1 и 8.4), ЦУР 12, ЦУР 13, ЦУР 14 (в частности, 14.4.1)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Институциональная информация&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Организация: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Продовольственная и сельскохозяйственная организация Объединенных Наций (ФАО)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Понятия и определения &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Определения: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Этот показатель выражает добавленную стоимость устойчивого морского рыболовства как долю в валовом внутреннем продукте (ВВП). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Понятия: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;u&gt;Валовой внутренний продукт (ВВП) &lt;/u&gt; - это стоимость всех конечных товаров и услуг, произведенных в экономике за определенный период, которая эквивалентна сумме добавленной стоимости (ДС) во всех секторах экономики&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Добавленная стоимость морского рыболовства &lt;/u&gt; - отражает стоимость рыбы, выловленной из морских запасов, за вычетом стоимости товаров и услуг, которые используются в производственном процессе (например, сырья и коммунальных услуг). Добавленная стоимость морского рыболовства включает виды деятельности, которые обычно интегрированы в процесс производства и происходят в море, например, на рыболовных судах, где происходит переработка или хранение улова на борту. Однако добавленная стоимость морского рыболовства не включает переработку или консервирование рыбы, когда эти процессы происходят на суше.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Рыбные запасы &lt;/u&gt; - это подмножество видов (рыб, ракообразных, моллюсков и т. д.) или популяции, населяющие географический район и участвующие в одном и том же репродуктивном процессе.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Максимальный устойчивый вылов (МУВ) &lt;/u&gt; - это наивысший теоретический равновесный улов, который может непрерывно изыматься (в среднем) из запасов при существующих (средних) условиях окружающей среды без значительного воздействия на процесс воспроизводства. Запасы, вылавливаемые в пределах &lt;u&gt; (МУВ)&lt;/u&gt;, называются &lt;u&gt; биологически устойчивыми&lt;/u&gt;, поскольку они могут оставаться стабильными или расти, принимая во внимание постоянные потери от промысла и природных источников смертности.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;u&gt; Рыбопромысловые районы ФАО для статистических целей &lt;/u&gt; - условные районы для облегчения сравнения данных, расширяющие возможности сотрудничества в статистических вопросах.&lt;sup&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-1&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-1&quot;&gt; [1] &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; Основные понятия, связанные с этим показателем, являются частью следующих международных документов и классификационных схем: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt; Конвенция Организации Объединенных Наций по морскому праву 1982 года (ЮНКЛОС)&lt;sup&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-2&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt; [2] &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/u&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt; Этот документ является основой, на которой построены все последующие документы. ЮНКЛОС определяет права и обязанности стран в отношении использования ими Мирового океана, устанавливая руководящие принципы для предприятий, окружающей среды и управления морскими природными ресурсами. Это документ, имеющий обязательную силу, хотя его принципы могут также применяться странами, не являющимися его участниками&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;u&gt; Кодекс ФАО 1995 года по ведению ответственного рыболовства (КВОР)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-3&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt; Настоящий документ обеспечивает необходимую основу для национальных и международных усилий по обеспечению рационального использования водных живых ресурсов в гармонии с окружающей средой путем установления принципов и стандартов, применимых к сохранению всех видов рыбного промысла, управлению им и его развитию. &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Кодекс ФАО по ведению ответственного рыболовства опирается на понятие МУВ при установлении общих принципов и стандартов управления рыболовством. В статье 7.2.1 подробно описано, каким образом меры управления должны быть основаны на лучших имеющихся научных данных и предназначены для поддержания или восстановления запасов на уровнях, способных обеспечить максимальный устойчивый вылов, как определено соответствующими экологическими и экономическими факторами, включая особые необходимые условия развивающихся стран&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Международная стандартная отраслевая классификация (МСОК)Организации Объединенных Наций &lt;/u&gt; &lt;sup&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-4&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-4&quot;&gt; [4] &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Все компоненты морского рыболовства четко определены в разделе A 0311 МСОК, пересмотренный вариант &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-1&quot;&gt;1 &lt;/sup&gt; &lt;p&gt; Рыболовные районы ФАО для статистических целей: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/cwp-on-fishery-statistics/handbook/general-concepts/major-fishing-areas-general/en/&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/cwp-on-fishery-statistics/handbook/general-concepts/major-fishing-areas-general/en/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-1&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; Конвенция Организации Объединенных Наций по морскому праву ЮНКЛОС: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; Кодекс ФАО по ведению ответственного рыболовства: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/3/v9878e/V9878E.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/3/v9878e/V9878E.pdf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-3&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; МСОК четвертый пересмотренный вариант: &lt;a href=&quot;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/seriesm/seriesm_4rev4e.pdf&quot;&gt;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/seriesm/seriesm_4rev4e.pdf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-4&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Источники данных &lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Сбор данных: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Данные по ВВП и добавленной стоимости извлекаются ФАО из базы данных СОООН (или ОЭСР в случае отсутствия значений) один раз в год в феврале. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ФАО собирает и распространяет информацию о состоянии запасов раз в два года в публикации Состояние мирового рыболовства и аквакультуры (СОФИА). Когда станут доступны данные, представленные странами по показателю 14.4.1 ЦУР (&amp;#x201C; Доля рыбных запасов, находящихся в биологически устойчивых пределах &amp;#x201D;), они будут использоваться вместо нынешнего коэффициент рационального использования для показателя 14.7.1 ЦУР. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Выпуск данных: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ожидается, что новые данные по этому показателю будут публиковаться раз в два года в марте. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Поставщики данных &lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Продовольственная и сельскохозяйственная организация ООН. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Обоснование: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Хотя задача 14.7 способствует устойчивому использованию морских ресурсов &amp;#x201C;, включая рыболовство, аквакультуру и туризм &amp;#x201D;, этот показатель, отобранный МГЭ-ЦУР, фокусируется только на устойчивом использовании морских ресурсов в сфере рыболовства. Таким образом, предложенная ФАО методология оценивает устойчивое рыболовство в процентах от ВВП в соответствии с согласованной формулировкой показателя. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Доля добавленной стоимости отрасли в ВВП обычно используется как показатель ее экономической значимости. Соответственно, добавленная стоимость морского рыболовства указывает на важность видов деятельности, связанных с морской рыбой, в экономике страны и их важность для жизнеобеспечения. И ВВП, и добавленная стоимость отражаются в постоянных ценах и в национальной валюте. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Запасы, которые вылавливаются на устойчивом уровне, могут поддерживать сообщества и отрасли, которые от них зависят, без ущерба для воспроизводства и долгосрочной устойчивости. Напротив, запасы, которые эксплуатируются до такой степени, что они не могут пополняться, в конечном итоге не обеспечат достаточную долгосрочную экономическую выручку для заинтересованных сторон. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Состояние рыбных запасов оценивается с помощью различных процессов оценки, которые обычно объединяют биологическую и статистическую информацию для оценки изменений в их численности как реакцию на промысловую деятельность, что также позволяет прогнозировать будущие тенденции. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ФАО периодически анализирует и формирует состояние морских рыбных запасов, объединяя результаты имеющихся официальных оценок запасов, включая оценки, проводимые на региональном уровне и в более мелком масштабе национальными учреждениями и научными рабочими группами. Для запасов, по которым нет официальной оценки запаса, предпринимаются усилия по сбору соответствующих данных и информации из литературных источников или от местных экспертов, которые могут быть использованы для подготовки заключения о состоянии запаса (например, тенденции в интенсивности рыболовства, частотное распределение размеров вылова, оценки случайной промысловой смертности, получаемые с помощью обследований и т. д.). Информация из различных источников анализируется и объединяется для систематизации эксплуатационного статуса рыбных запасов. Мониторинг запасов ФАО будет усилен с внедрением показателя 14.4.1 ЦУР, по которому надлежит отслеживать прогресс в направлении увеличения рыбных запасов в биологически устойчивых состояниях на национальном, региональном (по важным районам рыбного промысла ФАО) и глобальном уровнях. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; По данным мониторинга запасов ФАО на региональном и глобальном уровнях, доля рыбных ресурсов, находящихся в пределах биологически устойчивых уровней, показала тенденцию к снижению с 90 процентов в 1974 году до 67 процентов в 2015 году, вместе с тем 33 процента рыбных ресурсов считаются чрезмерно эксплуатируемыми. Чрезмерная эксплуатация не только имеет негативные экологические последствия, но и снижает рыбные уловы в долгосрочной перспективе, что имеет неблагоприятные социальные и экономические последствия, особенно для общин, зависящих от рыболовства в развивающихся странах и малых островных развивающихся государствах (МОРАГ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Комментарии и ограничения: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Показатель отражает добавленную стоимость устойчивого морского рыболовства как долю в ВВП. Однако подавляющее большинство стран предоставляют только агрегированные данные по добавленной стоимости сектора рыболовства и аквакультуры. Чтобы решить эту проблему, необходимо выделить добавленную стоимость морского рыболовства из агрегированных данных. Желательно, чтобы это было сделано с использованием величины морского рыболовства в качестве косвенного показателя. В условиях отсутствия стоимостных данных, количество выловленной морской рыбы, как доли в общем объеме производства, используется в качестве косвенного показателя доли добавленной стоимости.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; В отношении морского рыболовства, несмотря на более широкий охват в последние годы оценок ФАО, недостаток в данных может привести к неопределенности в отношении уровня эксплуатации запаса. Несмотря на существующую ограниченность данных, применяемая ФАО методология старается устранить расхождения и обеспечить репрезентативную оценку запасов морских рыб. Временные ряды, в которых имеется оценка запасов, начинаются с первой публикации в 2011 году в открытом доступе оценки запасов, сделанной ФАО для каждого важного района рыбного промысла. ФАО продолжает публиковать эту информацию раз в два года. &lt;sup&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-8&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-8&quot;&gt; [8] &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Национальные оценки рыбных запасов доступны только для нескольких стран и поэтому не являются репрезентативными на глобальном или региональном уровне. Следовательно, коэффициент рационального использования, применяемый при составлении этого показателя, основан на среднем значении рационального использования рыбных запасов, рассчитываемого ФАО для каждого важного района рыбного промысла. Для каждой страны коэффициент рационального использования будет являться средним значением рационального использования, взвешенным на долю в количестве морского рыбного промысла для каждого соответствующего района рыболовства, в котором страна осуществляет рыболовную деятельность. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; В настоящее время ФАО намерена приступить к составлению оценок на страновом уровне для показателя 14.4.1 ЦУР (доля рыбных запасов, находящихся в биологически устойчивых пределах) в 2020 году. Как только эти оценки станут доступны, метод расчета для текущего показателя будет скорее использовать оценки на уровне страны, а не оценки, основанные на важных районах рыбного промысла ФАО, чтобы определить коэффициент рационального использования и, следовательно, оценить добавленную стоимость устойчивого морского рыболовства как долю в ВВП. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;sup class = &quot; footnote-number &quot;id =&quot; footnote-8 &quot;&gt; 8 &lt;/sup&gt; &lt;p&gt; Самая последняя версия Обзора состояния мировых морских рыбных ресурсов, содержащего информацию о состоянии запасов, доступна по адресу 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-8&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Методология&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;На страновом уровне вклад устойчивого морского рыболовства в ВВП рассчитывается следующим образом: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) Доля рыболовства и аквакультуры в ВВП оценивается простым делением добавленной стоимости рыболовства и аквакультуры (РиА) на национальный ВВП.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Вклад в ВВП рыболовства и аквакультуры (%) = Добавленная стоимость рыболовства и аквакультуры / ВВП&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;ВВП&lt;sub&gt;РиА&lt;/sub&gt; = ДС&lt;sub&gt;РиА&lt;/sub&gt;/ВВП&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) Для того чтобы дезагрегировать добавленную стоимость морского рыболовства и добавленную стоимость аквакультуры, необходимо количество рыбы, добытой в результате морского рыболовства, разделить на общее количество национальной добычи рыбы, а затем умножить на долю рыболовства и аквакультуры в ВВП. Таким образом, количество продукции морского рыболовства используется в качестве косвенного показателя стоимости морского рыболовства. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Косвенный показатель добавленной стоимости морского рыболовства (%)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Доля в ВВП рыболовства и аквакультуры x (Количество добытой рыбы морского рыболовства / общее количество добытой рыбы)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ДС&lt;sub&gt;Р &lt;/sub&gt; ВВП&lt;sub&gt;РиА&lt;/sub&gt; x (К&lt;sub&gt;М&lt;/sub&gt;/К&lt;sub&gt;В&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c)Коэффициент рационального использования будет рассчитываться на основе среднего значения рационального использования, периодически публикуемого для каждого важного района рыбного промысла ФАО. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Для каждой страны коэффициентом рационального использования будет являться средним значением рационального использования, взвешенным на долю количества морского вылова для каждого соответствующего района рыболовства, в котором страна осуществляет рыболовную деятельность. Когда страна ведет вылов только в одном районе рыбного промысла ФАО, то ее коэффициент рационального использования будет равен среднему значению рационального использования запасов в этом районе.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Коэффициент рационального использования = Сумма значений рационального использования для каждого региона x (Количество вылова в каждом морском регионе / Общее количество вылова из всех морских регионов) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;В настоящее время для этого показателя нет дезагрегированных параметров. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Обработка отсутствующих значений: &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Этот показатель отражает экономический вклад морского рыболовства. Если в стране нет морского рыболовства, показатель для этой страны не рассчитывается. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Вменение не производится для получения оценок по странам или годам, если нет данных о добавленной стоимости рыболовства и аквакультуры, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ФАО использует широкий спектр данных и анализа для оценки 500 рыбных запасов, что составляет 70 - 80 процентов мирового вылова. Подробное описание подхода, используемого ФАО, доступно в Обзоре состояния мировых морских рыбных ресурсов.&lt;sup&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-9&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-9&quot;&gt; [9] &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Региональные агрегаты будут рассчитываться только на основе вклада рационального использования рыбных ресурсов в ВВП тех стран, которые представили отчеты о добавленной стоимости рыболовства и аквакультуры в данном году. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-9&quot;&gt; 9 &lt;/sup&gt; &lt;p&gt; Самая последняя версия Обзора состояния мировых морских рыбных ресурсов доступна по адресу &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf&quot;&gt; http://www.fao.org/docrep /015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf &lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-9&quot;&gt; &amp;#x2191; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Региональные и глобальные агрегаты: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Для получения региональных и глобальных агрегированных показателей будут применяться средние значения показателя для стран в каждом регионе ЦУР. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; При интерпретации агрегированных региональных показателей важно учитывать, что географический регион страны не обязательно указывает на то, как и где страна ловит рыбу. Страны могут ловить рыбу в совершенно иных рыболовных районах, а не в тех, где ловят рыбу другие страны в их регионе, и поэтому региональные агрегаты, привязанные к земной поверхности, могут быть не применимы к морским ресурсам.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Гарантия качества: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Для обеспечения непрерывности сбора данных по добавленной стоимости рыболовства и аквакультуры, а также ВВП по различным версиям Системы национальных счетов (СНС) и пересмотрам МСОК, Департамент рыболовства и аквакультуры ФАО обеспечивает их согласованность путем использования обратных и прямых связей при сборе и валидации информации. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Хотя показатель 14.7.1 ЦУР полностью основан на данных, уже предоставленных странами в ФАО, Статистический отдел Организации Объединенных Наций (СОООН) и Организацию экономического сотрудничества и развития (ОЭСР), странам предлагается сотрудничать с ФАО для повышения точности их результатов, предоставляя недоступные иным образом исходные данные для расчета показателя.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Доступность данных &lt;h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Описание:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Показатель может быть рассчитан на основе имеющихся в настоящее время данных по 128 странам, которые занимаются морским рыболовным промыслом и представили данные по добавленной стоимости рыболовства и аквакультуры по крайней мере один раз, начиная с 2011 года. Список вышеупомянутых стран включает 35 малых островных развивающихся государств, 68 развивающихся стран и 23 наименее развитые страны.&lt;/p&gt;
