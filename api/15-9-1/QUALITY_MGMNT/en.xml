	<message>The QUALITY_MGMNT field for indicator 15-9-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For sub-indicator (a)&lt;/strong&gt;, the information is provided by Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity directly through their sixth national reports. The information can only be submitted by the National Focal Point to the Convention on Biological Diversity. Given that the information is submitted directly by the Party, there are no significant issues related to quality management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For sub-indicator (b)&lt;/strong&gt;, the UNCEEA evaluates the Global Assessment survey with each administration to ensure the survey is clear and obtains the information needed. The UNCEEA also reviews all reports related to the Global Assessment survey results.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
