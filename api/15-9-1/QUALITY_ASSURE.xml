			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Sub-indicator (a): The information is provided by Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity directly through their sixth national reports. The information can only be submitted by the National Focal Point to the Convention on Biological Diversity. Given that the information is submitted directly by the Party, there are no significant issues related to quality assurance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sub-indicator (b): When the information is provided by countries directly through the Global Assessment, there are no significant issues related to quality assurance. In the case of imputation, this is only used as a secondary step after first contacting countries. If UNSD finds that a country compiles SEEA accounts through a project or implementation, this information is verified with the appropriate persons within the international organizations involved. &lt;/p&gt;
