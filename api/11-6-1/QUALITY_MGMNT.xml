			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;To ensure consistency in data production across countries, UN-Habitat has developed detailed step-by-step tutorials on the computation of indicator 11.6.1, which further explain the steps presented in this metadata. The detailed tutorials, which will be continuously updated are available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://unhabitat.org/knowledge/data-and-analytics&quot;&gt;https://unhabitat.org/knowledge/data-and-analytics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbanagendaplatform.org/learning&quot;&gt;https://www.urbanagendaplatform.org/learning&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.unhabitat.org/&quot;&gt;https://data.unhabitat.org/&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within its Data and Analytics Section which is responsible for the indicator data compilation, UN-Habitat has a team of data experts who check all submitted data and provide direct support to countries in the indicator computation in collaboration with the Agency&amp;#x2019;s waste management experts. As part of its global custodianship of indicator 11.6.1, UN-Habitat has also worked closely with relevant UN agencies such as UN Statistics Division and UN Environment, as well as prominent waste management experts and environmental statisticians from all over the world. This helped create a common understanding on the approach for the indicator computation, and to encouraged continuous production of high-quality global data that responds to the indicator computation needs.&lt;/p&gt;
