	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 11-6-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;It is recommended to establish a system where local or municipal governments collect SDG 11.6.1 data utilizing Waste Wise Cities Tool, then the data aggregated by the ministries and agencies in charge of environmental protection. These collected data should be reported to UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics every two years from national statistical offices of countries. Currently the response rate for the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire is around 50% and data completeness and quality remain a challenge, especially for developing countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries may report their data to UNSD via the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics (waste section) following application of the methods specified in this metadata template. UNSD engages in an extensive data validation process including automated checks, and liaisons with the country&amp;#x2019;s NSO or Ministry of Environment.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
