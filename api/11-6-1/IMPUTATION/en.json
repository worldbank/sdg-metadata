Communication is carried out with countries for clarification and validation of data. UNSD does not make any estimation or imputation for missing values so the number of data points provided are actual country data. Only data that are considered accurate or those confirmed by countries during the validation process are included in UNSD&#x2019;s environment statistics database and disseminated on UNSD&#x2019;s website.</p>"}
