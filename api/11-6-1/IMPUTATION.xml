  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At country level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missing values may arise at the reporting of the city level estimates. At the national level, estimates will be derived by relevant national entities from the nationally representative sample of cities, in which case then there will be very few missing entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At regional and global levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding promoting data quality assurance through the collection of data via the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics, UNSD carries out extensive data validation procedures that include built-in automated procedures, manual checks and cross-references to national sources of data. Communication is carried out with countries for clarification and validation of data. UNSD does not make any estimation or imputation for missing values so the number of data points provided are actual country data. Only data that are considered accurate or those confirmed by countries during the validation process are included in UNSD&amp;#x2019;s environment statistics database and disseminated on UNSD&amp;#x2019;s website.&lt;/p&gt;
