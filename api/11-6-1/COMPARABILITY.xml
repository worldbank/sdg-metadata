&lt;p&gt;Data on formal Municipal solid waste collection and management may be available from municipal bodies and/or private contractors. Informal collection data may be available from NGOs and community organizations. It is important that all data sources are used for reporting, otherwise discrepancies in forms and guides used are likely to introduce inconsistencies in reported figures. Discrepancies are also likely to arise where geographical jurisdictions are not well marked out for service providers and facilities that manage collected waste.&lt;/p&gt;
