	<message>The STAT_CONC_DEF field for indicator 2-2-2b, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prevalence of wasting (weight for height &amp;lt;-2 standard deviation from the median of the World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards) among children under 5 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concepts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official MDG indicator is wasting as assessed using weight for height. Wasting can however also be assessed with mid upper arm circumference (MUAC). Estimates of wasting based on MUAC are not considered for the joint dataset. In addition, while wasting constitutes the major form of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM), there are acutely malnourished children who would not be picked up with weight-for-height or MUAC, namely those presenting bilateral pitting odema (characterized by swollen feet, face and limbs). For Surveys that report oedema cases, in the joint data set these are included in the prevalence of low weight-for-height. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
