			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS) (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/tools/child-growth-standards/who-multicentre-growth-reference-study&quot;&gt;WHO 2006&lt;/a&gt;) was undertaken to generate a growth standard for assessing the growth and development of infants and young children around the world. The MGRS collected primary growth data and related information from children from widely different ethnic backgrounds and cultural settings (Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, Oman, and the USA). The resulting growth standard can be applied to all children everywhere, regardless of ethnicity, socioeconomic status and type of feeding. The indicator refers to those moderately or severely wasted, that is with a z-score below -2 standard deviations from the median weight-for-length/height of the growth standard. &lt;/p&gt;
