{"status":"success","message":"The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 2-2-2b, translated into all languages","data":{"ar":"","en":"<p>UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank undertake a joint review for each potential data source (e.g., household survey). The group conducts a review when (at minimum) a final report with full methodological details and results is available, as well as (ideally) a data quality assessment flagging potential limitations. When the raw data are available, they are analysed using the Anthro Survey Analyzer software to produce a standard set of results and data quality outputs against which the review is conducted . Comments are documented in a standard review template extracting methodological details (e.g., sampling procedures, description of anthropometrical equipment), data quality outputs (e.g., weight and height distributions, percentage of cases that were flagged as implausible according to the WHO Child Growth Standards) and the malnutrition prevalence estimates from the data source under review generated based on the standard recommended methodology. These estimates are compared against the reported values, as well as against those from other data sources already included in the JME database, to assess the plausibility of the trend before including the new point. Reports that are preliminary, or that lack key details on methodology or results, cannot be reviewed and are left pending until full information is available. Country consultations with SDG 2.2 focal points are also held every two years before finalizing and disseminating each edition of the JME estimates. The purpose of the country consultations is to ensure the wasting estimates included all recent and relevant country data and to engage with and receive feedback from national governments on the estimates. </p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
