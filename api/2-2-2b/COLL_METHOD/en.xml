	<data>&lt;p&gt;UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank group jointly review new data sources to update the country level estimates. Each agency uses their existing mechanisms for obtaining data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For UNICEF, the cadre of dedicated data and monitoring specialists working at national, regional and international levels in 190 countries routinely provide technical support for the collection and analysis of nutrition data. UNICEF also relies on a data source catalogue that is regularly updated using data sources from catalogues of other international organizations and national statistics offices. This data collection is done in close collaboration with UNICEF regional offices with the purpose of ensuring that UNICEF global databases contain updated and internationally comparable data. The regional office staff work with country offices and local counterparts to ensure all relevant data are shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHO data gathering strongly relies on the organization&amp;#x2019;s structure and network established over the past 30 years, since the creation of its global database, the WHO Global Database on Child Growth and Malnutrition, in the late 1980&amp;#x2019;s (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15542535/&quot;&gt;de Onis et al. 2004&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank Group provides estimates available through the Living Standard Measurement Surveys (LSMS) which usually requires re-analysis of datasets given that the LSMS reports often do not tabulate the child malnutrition data.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
