	<message>The INST_MANDATE field for indicator 2-2-2b, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;UNICEF is responsible for global monitoring and reporting on the wellbeing of children. UNICEF actively supports countries in data collection and analysis for reporting on child malnutrition indicators primarily through high-quality MICS surveys, as well as providing technical and financial support to other surveys. UNICEF not only supports household surveys but also works with global partners to define technical standards for the collection and analysis of anthropometric data. UNICEF also compiles statistics on child nutrition with the goal of making internationally comparable estimates and databases publicly available. In-depth analyses of the data on child malnutrition, which are included in relevant data-driven publications, including in its flagship publication, &lt;em&gt;The State of the World&amp;#x2019;s Children,&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Child Nutrition Report&lt;/em&gt; are also conducted by UNICEF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHO has an established role in the monitoring of child growth and malnutrition since the late 1980&amp;#x2019;s and had the mandate to develop the WHO Child Growth Standards, launched in 2006, and adopted by more than 160 countries. WHO has published several per-reviewed articles with regional and global estimates until 2012, when they joined forces with UNICEF and the World Bank, with the objective of harmonizing child malnutrition estimates. WHO has the mandate to monitor and report progress on the six global nutrition targets, endorsed in 2012 by the World Health Assembly, amongst them, three on child malnutrition, namely stunting, overweight and wasting (SDG 2.2.1, 2.2.2 (1) and 2.2.2 (2)).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
