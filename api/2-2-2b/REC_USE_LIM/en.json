{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 2-2-2b, translated into en","data":"<p>Survey estimates have uncertainty due to both sampling error and non-sampling error (e.g., measurement technical error, recording error etc.,). While non-sampling error cannot be accounted for or reviewed in full, when available, a data quality review of weight, height and age <s>measurements </s><u>data </u>from household surveys supports compilation of a time series that is comparable across countries and over time. None of the two sources of errors have been fully taken into account for deriving estimates neither at country nor at regional or worldwide levels.</p>\n<p>Surveys are carried out in a specific period of the year, usually over a few months. However, this indicator can be affected by seasonality, factors related to food availability (e.g., pre-harvest periods), disease (e.g., rainy season and diarrhoea, malaria, etc.), and natural disasters and conflicts. Hence, country-year estimates may not necessarily be comparable over time. Consequently, only latest estimates are provided.</p>"}
