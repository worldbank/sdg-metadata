	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The JME global estimates from 2000 to 2022 for wasting were released for 15&lt;u&gt;7&lt;/u&gt;&lt;s&gt;5&lt;/s&gt; countries that had at least one primary data source (e.g., from household survey) included in the 202&lt;u&gt;3&lt;/u&gt;&lt;s&gt;1&lt;/s&gt; JME country database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At country level, data are provided for the years where primary data sources are included in the JME database. Data source years range from 1983 to the year before the JME release. Worldwide and regional estimates are provided only for the year before the JME release (e.g., wasting estimates released in 2021 were provided only for the year 2020). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide and regional estimates refer to the age group of children under 5 years, sexes combined. A disaggregated dataset of national primary sources with sub national and stratified estimates (e.g., sex, age groups, wealth, mothers&amp;apos; education, residence) is available.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
