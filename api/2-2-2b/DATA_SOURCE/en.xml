	<message>The DATA_SOURCE field for indicator 2-2-2b, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The majority of the data sources used are nationally representative household surveys (e.g., Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) and National Nutrition Surveys (NNS)). Some data come from other sources (e.g., administrative, sentinel systems or national information systems).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data providers vary and most commonly are ministries of health, national offices of statistics or national institutes of nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
