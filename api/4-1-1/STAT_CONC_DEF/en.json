In September 2018, an agreement was reached on a verbal definition of the global minimum proficiency level of reference for each of the areas and domains of Indicator 4.1.1 as described in the <a href=\"http://gaml.uis.unesco.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/MPLs_revised_doc_20190204.docx\"><u>Minimum Proficiency Levels (MPLs): Outcomes of the consensus building meeting</u></a>.</p>\n<p><em>Minimum proficiency levels defined by each learning assessment</em></p>\n<p>To ensure comparability across learning assessments, a verbal definition of MPL for each domain and levels between cross-national assessments (CNAs) was established by conducting an analysis of the performance level descriptors (PLDs)<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[1]</a></sup></sup> of cross-national, regional, and community-led tests in reading and mathematics. The analysis was led and completed by the UIS and a consensus among experts on the proposed methodology was deemed adequate and pragmatic.</p>\n<p>The global MPL definitions for the domains of reading and mathematics are presented in Table 1.</p>\n<p> Table 1.
