	<data>&lt;p&gt;As currently measured, most learning assessments have different methodologies for establishing a Minimum Proficiency level (MPL). The UIS and GAM establish standardization guidelines to guide the choice of the minimum thresholds based on the frameworks of each assessment program. The most critical decision is to choose in each assessment a level for international reporting that is consistent with the international definition of MPL. In the case of some assessment program, it means choosing a different level than the one the assessment program had been using for reporting results.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
