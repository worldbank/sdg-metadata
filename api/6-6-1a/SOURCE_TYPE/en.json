{"status":"success","message":"The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 6-6-1a, translated into en","data":"<p>Surface water area data, acquired by the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellites at a 30 m resolution, has been generated for the entire globe from 2000-2019. From 2016 onwards (up to and including 2030), higher spatial and temporal resolution satellites, including both optical and radar satellites, are used.). Additional datasets are used refine open water spatial area data, including the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) geospatial database. To generate spatial area of vegetated wetlands, a combination of imagery from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 1 and 2 are used Global Mangrove Watch data is derived from JAXA ALOS satellites and Landsat to generate mangrove extent. Water quality is derived from MERIS and European Sentinel satellites.</p>\n<p>Lake water trophic state and TSS lake observations are obtained from combined Landsat and Sentinel satellites paired with instruments like OLCI, MODIS, and VIIRS. The sensor instruments used to detect TSS and trophic state determine the spatial resolution of water quality within lakes which can be detected. Some of the more accurate water quality sensors have 250-350 meter resolution, while less accurate sensors can detect TSS and trophic state changes to 100 m resolution. </p>\n<p>The source of data for monitoring stream flow and groundwater quantity is from national in situ measurements of groundwater level within aquifers and stream flow quantity. However globally derived hydrological run off modelled data will soon be available and used to measure stream flow as part of indicator 661 replacing the need for In-situ stream flow measurements to be collected.</p>\n<p> </p>"}
