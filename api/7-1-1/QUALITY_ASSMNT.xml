			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Good quality data of electricity access should be generally aligned with the trends from the past data at country level. Also, the World Bank&amp;#x2019;s data results would not have high discrepancies about more than 5 percentage points with IEA data, although the World Bank (based on standardized household surveys and censuses) and IEA (based on government-reported values) maintain separate database of global electricity access rates. Meanwhile, given the consultation with internal stakeholders and the UN regional commissions, data points of some countries are adjusted to reflect their certain circumstances, such as national conflict. Therefore, for these countries, the access rate is not linearly increased.&lt;/p&gt;
