			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;A non-parametric model is consistently used to obtain a complete set of annual trends of electricity access rates by fulfilling the data gaps with model estimates. The model draws from solid fuel use modelling used in Bonjour et al (2013). The model closely follows empirical data without being influenced by large fluctuations in survey estimates. In general, regional trends are borrowed for the absence of survey data. However, some countries, which have significant discrepancies with IEA data, are considered as an outlier, not reflecting the regional trends, but just relying on their country effects.&lt;/p&gt;
