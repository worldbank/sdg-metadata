&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data for countries have been compiled from 1990 to the latest year, but there are gaps in accurate data availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electricity access rates are disaggregated by geographic location into total, urban and rural rates. Countries that are classified as &amp;#x201C;High Income&amp;#x201D; are assumed to reach universal access from the first year it was added to the category. Disaggregation of access to electricity by rural or urban place of residence is available at country, regional and global levels.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
