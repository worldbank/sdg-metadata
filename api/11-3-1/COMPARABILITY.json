This is largely due to the uniqueness of some local contexts and variations in image reflectance and land cover types, which make it difficult to accurately capture built up areas consistently. While the national figures will be used for reporting &#x2013; resulting in less differences being observed, some countries may opt to use the globally available products, which may create some variations as locally generated data becomes available. UN-Habitat will be responsible for checking all figures to ensure that no inconsistencies are reported. </p>\n<p>The second likely source of differences between figures is the approach used to define urban areas and cities for the purpose of the indicator computation. To resolve this, the use of the degree of urbanization approach to definition of urban and rural areas and production of comparable data is recommended. This approach was endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission in March 2020, and its incremental adoption by countries is likely to reduce any differences in the figures reported in future. </p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
