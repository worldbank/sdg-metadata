Input data for computation of the land consumption rate is extracted from multi-temporal satellite imagery through remote sensing and geospatial analysis processes. The quality of data for this component is greatly reliant on the resolution of the input satellite imagery, but the freely available Landsat and Sentinel Imagery provide good quality data that can consistently be used to compute the indicator. The methods of extracting data from these imageries vary from standalone commercial and open-source software (eg Erdas Imagine, Saga GIS, ENVI, etc) to cloud based processing systems such as Google Earth Engine. </p>\n<p>Computation of the population growth rate component of the indicator relies on data from statistical sources such as censuses, which should be disaggregated to the smallest units possible. Use of population modelling approaches (such as to produce gridded population datasets) is encouraged where high resolution data from the National Statistical Offices is not available. The approaches for disaggregating population to grids vary, but the most common ones include disaggregating populations to built-up areas. Some examples of common approaches are provided in the references section. </p>\n<p> To implement the Degree of Urbanisation approach to city/urban area definition, which is proposed for this indicator computation, the European Commission Joint Research Centre (EC-JRC) have developed a standalone application which uses either locally or globally produced input data on population and built up layers. The tool is available HERE, while the description of how to implement the approach is available HERE. </p>\n<p> </p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
