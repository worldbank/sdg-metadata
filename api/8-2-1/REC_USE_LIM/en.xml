	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 8-2-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Output measures are obtained from national accounts and represent, as much as possible, GDP at market prices for the aggregate economy. However, despite common principles that are mostly based on the United Nations System of National Accounts, there are still significant problems in international consistency of national accounts estimates, based on factors such as differences in the treatment of output in services sectors, differences in methods used to correct output measures for price changes (in particular, the use of different weighting systems to obtain deflators) and differences in the degree of coverage of informal economic activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on employment used in the denominator of this indicator refer, as much as possible, to the average number of persons with one or more paid jobs during the year. Employment data are based on the statistical standards from the 13th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
