	<message>The REG_AGG field for indicator 8-2-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;To address the problem of missing data, the ILO designed several econometric models which are used to produce estimates of labour market indicators in the countries and years for which real data are not available. The employment data derived from the ILO modelled estimates are used to produce estimates on labour productivity. These models use multivariate regression techniques to impute missing values at the country level, which are then aggregated to produce regional and global estimates. For further information on the estimates, please refer to the ILO modelled estimates methodological overview, available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/TEM.pdf&quot;&gt;https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/TEM.pdf&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
