{"status":"success","message":"The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 6-1-1, translated into en","data":"<p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>\n<p>JMP estimates are based on national sources of data approved as official statistics. Differences between global and national figures arise due to differences in indicator definitions and methods used in calculating national coverage estimates. In some cases, national estimates are based on the most recent data point rather than from regression on all data points as done by the JMP. In order to generate national estimates, the JMP uses data that are representative of urban and rural populations and UN population estimates and projections (UN DESA World Population Prospects: <a href=\"https://population.un.org/wpp/\">https://population.un.org/wpp/</a>; World Urbanization Projects: <a href=\"https://population.un.org/wup\">https://population.un.org/wup</a>) which may differ from national population estimates. </p>"}
