{"status":"success","message":"The REG_AGG field for indicator 6-1-1, translated into en","data":"<p>For safely managed drinking water services, the proportions of the regional population using improved drinking water sources that are accessible on premises, available when needed and free from contamination are calculated as weighted averages amongst populations using improved drinking water sources. The resulting ratios are multiplied by the proportion of the population using improved drinking water sources in each region. Following the approach taken for countries, the proportion of the population using safely managed drinking water services is then calculated at regional and global levels by taking a minimum of the three elements, or of two elements if either accessibility or availability is missing. These proportions are calculated separately for urban and rural areas and, where possible, a weighted average is made of rural and urban populations to produce total estimates for the region or world.</p>\n<p>For more details on JMP rules and methods: JMP Methodology: 2017 update and SDG baselines:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://washdata.org/report/jmp-methodology-2017-update\">https://washdata.org/report/jmp-methodology-2017-update</a></p>"}
