	<data>&lt;p&gt;The computation uses each institutions&amp;#x2019; own published membership and voting rights data from their respective annual reports. The ratio of voting rights is computed as the number of voting rights allocated to developing countries (as classified by the &amp;#x201C;historical&amp;#x201D; classification of &amp;#x201C;Developed regions&amp;#x201D; and &amp;#x201C;Developing regions&amp;#x201D; as of December 2021 in the United Nations M49 statistical standard), divided by the total number of voting rights. The ratio of membership is calculated by taking the number of developing country members (using the same classification), divided by the total number of members. Both ratios are expressed as percentages.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
