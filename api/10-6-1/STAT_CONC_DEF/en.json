{"status":"success","message":"The STAT_CONC_DEF field for indicator 10-6-1, translated into en","data":"<h3>Definition:</h3>\n<p>The indicator <em>Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international organizations </em>has two separate components: the developing country proportion of voting rights and the developing country proportion of membership in international organisations. In some institutions, these two components are identical.</p>\n<p>The indicator is calculated independently for eleven different international institutions: The United Nations General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Finance Corporation, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Trade Organisation, and the Financial Stability Board.</p>\n<h3>Concepts:</h3>\n<p>There is no established convention for the designation of &quot;developed&quot; and &quot;developing&quot; countries or areas in the United Nations system. The aggregation across all institutions is currently done according to the &#x201C;historical&#x201D; classification of &#x201C;Developed regions&#x201D; and &#x201C;Developing regions&#x201D; as of December 2021 in the United Nations M49 statistical standard. The removal of this classification from the M49 standard at the end of 2021 makes it more urgent to reach agreement on how to define these terms for the purposes of SDG monitoring. The designations &quot;developed&quot; and developing&quot; are intended for statistical convenience and do not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the development process.</p>"}
