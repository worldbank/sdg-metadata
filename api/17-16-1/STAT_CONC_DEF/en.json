It does so by looking at development effectiveness frameworks that are led by countries but include the participation of all relevant development partners. </p>\n<p>The Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (Global Partnership) monitoring framework is an example of existing development effectiveness monitoring frameworks. There are other complementary efforts, such as the ECOSOC Development Cooperation Forum (DCF) mutual accountability survey. Emerging and future monitoring frameworks that fit the above definition, such as recent efforts to track South-South Cooperation by SEGIB, could also be considered.</p>"}
