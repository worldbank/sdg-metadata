			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The design of the indicator has practical benefits: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; the indicator allows for relevant monitoring frameworks to be updated in line with evolving commitments and country specific context without affecting the spirit of the indicator;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; the indicator does not presume a globally-set multi-stakeholder framework, acknowledging the diversity of complementary efforts supporting effective development cooperation;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; the indicator allows participating countries to choose whether they would like to report as a provider of development co-operation, as a recipient, or both. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data collection for the Global Partnership monitoring framework is led by countries receiving development co-operation. Progress of countries providing development co-operation in implementing development effectiveness commitments is captured through their partnership behaviour in those countries. Depending on each case, countries that currently are both recipient and providers of development cooperation opt to report in their role as recipient and/or provider of development cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
