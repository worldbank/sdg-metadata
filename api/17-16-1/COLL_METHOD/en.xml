	<data>&lt;p&gt;(i) For the data collection process of the Global Partnership&amp;apos;s monitoring exercise, a national coordinator is assigned from the country government. S/he typically comes from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Planning, or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(ii) The national coordinator in turn consults with other stakeholders (including country offices of providers of development co-operation, Civil Society Organisations, the private sector, and trade unions) to gather and validate data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data is then reviewed by headquarters offices of providers of development co-operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(iii) No adjustments are made to submitted data, given that the validation process needs to stay at country level. However, inconsistencies or possible problematic values are highlighted and sent back to national coordinators for revision.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
