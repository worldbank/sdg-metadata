&lt;p&gt;As it measures the degree of implementation of an enabling environment for better water resources management, it directly supports the other outcome targets under SDG 6 (6.1 &amp;#x2013; 6.6). It does this by providing further information to countries on the context and possible explanation for the progress on other targets, and points to barriers and enablers to obtaining the other targets. It also directly supports the means of implementation targets 6.a and 6.b, as disaggregation is possible to provide data on financing (6.a) and stakeholder participation (6.b). Beyond SDG 6, indicator 6.5.1 has linkages with a number of other targets across the SDGs, as integrated water resources management is concerned with integrating the demands and impacts on water resources and water-related ecosystems from a number of different SDGs and their targets, including: poverty (1.4); agriculture (2.3); education (4.7); gender (5.5); energy (7.1); work (8.5); equality (10.2); urban areas (11.3); climate change (13.2); ecosystems (15.9); governance (16.3, 16.5 &amp;#x2013; 16.7) (UN-Water 2016).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Institutional information&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Organization(s):&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Concepts and definitions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definition:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicator 6.5.1 is &amp;#x2018;degree of integrated water resources management implementation (0-100)&amp;#x2019;. It measures the stages of development and implementation of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), on a scale of 0 to 100, in six categories (see Rationale section). The indicator score is calculated from a country survey with 33 questions, with each question scored on the same scale of 0-100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of IWRM is based on an internationally agreed definition, and is universally applicable. IWRM was officially established in 1992 and is defined as &amp;#x201C;a process which promotes the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources in order to maximise economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems.&amp;#x201D; (GWP 2010). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The method builds on official UN IWRM status reporting, from 2008 and 2012, of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation from the UN World Summit for Sustainable Development (1992).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of IWRM is measured in 4 main sections, each representing key dimension of IWRM: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Enabling environment: this includes the policies, laws, plans and strategies which create the &amp;#x2018;enabling environment&amp;#x2019; for IWRM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Institutions and participation: includes the range and roles of political, social, economic and administrative institutions that help to support the implementation of IWRM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Management Instruments: The tools and activities that enable decision-makers and users to make rational and informed choices between alternative actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Financing: Budgeting and financing made available and used for water resources development and management from various sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is based on a national survey structured around these four main sections. Each section is split into two parts: questions concerning the &amp;#x2018;National level&amp;#x2019; and &amp;#x2018;Other levels&amp;#x2019; respectively. &amp;#x2018;Other levels&amp;#x2019; includes sub-national (including provinces/states for federated countries), basin level, and the transboundary level as appropriate. These two parts address the wording of Target 6.5 &amp;#x2018;implement [IWRM] at all levels &amp;#x2026;&amp;#x2019;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Data sources&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monitoring progress on meeting SDG 6.5 is owned by and is the responsibility of the national government. The government will assign a ministry with the primary responsibility for overseeing this survey, which will be asked to take on the responsibility of coordinating the national IWRM monitoring and reporting process. As water management issues cut across a wide number of sectors, often overseen by different ministries and other administrative bodies at national or other levels, the process should be inclusive. Major stakeholders should be involved in order to contribute to well informed and objective answers to the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministry is invited to nominate a national &amp;#x201C;IWRM focal point&amp;#x201D;, who may or may not be a government official. The UN will provide support where needed and possible. The following steps are suggested as guidance only, as it is up to countries to decide which process or processes would best serve their needs. It should also be noted that the following steps represent a &amp;#x2018;ladder&amp;#x2019; approach, in that completing all the steps will generally lead to a more robust indicator. However, it may not be possible or necessary for all countries to complete all steps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The responsible ministry or IWRM focal point contacts other relevant ministries/agencies to compile responses to the questionnaire. Each possible response option has a score which will be used to calculate the overall indicator score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The completed draft survey is reviewed by government stakeholders. These stakeholders could include those involved in water-relevant sectors, such as agriculture, energy, water supply and environment, as well as water management at different administrative levels. This process may be electronic (e.g. via email) and/or through workshops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The revised draft survey is validated at a multi-stakeholder workshop. Apart from government representatives these stakeholders could include water user associations, private sector, interest groups concerned with e.g. environment, agriculture, poverty, and academia. The suggested process is through a workshop but alternative means of consultation e.g. email or online call for public submissions could be considered. Note that steps 2 and 3 could be combined if desired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. The responsible ministry or IWRM focal point discusses with relevant officials and consolidates the input into a final version. This version is the basis for calculating the degree of IWRM implementation (0-100) for global reporting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. The responsible ministry submits the final indicator score to the national statistics office responsible for compiling all national SDG target data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the national survey, UN-Water will periodically prepare synthesis reports for regional and global levels to provide overall progress on meeting SDG target 6.5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temporal Coverage: A reporting cycle of three years is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Collection process:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official counterparts at the country level oversee the validation and consultation process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey has been designed so that the indicator is comparable between countries and time periods. No adjustments are foreseen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Calendar&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data collection: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January &amp;#x2013; May 2020 (5 months). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Data release: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1st quarter 2021&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Data providers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information required to complete the survey is expected to be held by government officials responsible for water resources management in the country, supported by official documentation. E.g. Ministry of Water in coordination with Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Lands and Agriculture, Ministry of Industry and Mining etc. See also &amp;#x2018;data sources&amp;#x2019; section above. As a minimum, a small group of officials may be able to complete the survey. However, these government officials may belong to various government authorities, and coordination will be required to determine and validate the responses to each question. Increased government and non-government stakeholder participation in validating the question scores will lead to a more robust indicator score and facilitate tracking progress over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Data compilers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNEP and UN-Water partners, under the UN-Water initiative on integrated monitoring of SDG 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rationale:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator provides a direct progress measurement of the first part of Target 6.5 &amp;#x201C;&amp;#x2026;implement integrated water resources management at all levels &amp;#x2026;&amp;#x201D;. The indicator score provides an easy and understandable way of measuring progress towards the target, with &amp;#x2018;0&amp;#x2019; interpreted as no implementation of IWRM, and &amp;#x2018;100&amp;#x2019; interpreted as IWRM being fully implemented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further aid interpretation and comparison, the indicator results can be categorized as follows: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Degree of implementation&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Score range&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;General interpretation for overall IWRM score&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Very high&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;91 - 100&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Vast majority of IWRM elements are fully implemented, with objectives consistently achieved, and plans and programmes periodically assessed and revised.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;High&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;71 - 90&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;IWRM objectives of plans and programmes are generally met, and geographic coverage and stakeholder engagement is generally good.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Medium-high&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;51 - 70&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Capacity to implement elements of IWRM is generally adequate, and elements are generally being implemented under long-term programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Medium-low&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;31 - 50&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Elements of IWRM are generally institutionalized, and implementation is underway.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Low&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;11 - 30&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Implementation of elements of IWRM has generally begun, but with limited uptake across the country, and potentially low engagement of stakeholder groups.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Very low&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;0 - 10&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Development of elements of IWRM has generally not begun, or has stalled.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the survey is that it provides sufficient information to be of real value to the countries in determining their progress towards the target, and through this, various aspects of IWRM. A balance has been sought between providing sufficient information to cover the core principles of IWRM, and thus providing a robust indicator value, and not overburdening countries with unnecessary reporting requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries are encouraged to provide additional information on each question, which may help to qualify their choice of score, and/or put that score into their national context. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicator 6.5.1 is supported by indicator 6.5.2 &amp;#x201C;Proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation&amp;#x201D;, which directly addresses the portion of Target 6.5 &amp;#x201C;&amp;#x2026;, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate.&amp;#x201D;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Comments and limitations:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge of subjectivity in responses associated with this type of survey is being addressed in a number of ways: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Draft responses are reviewed by a number of governmental and non-governmental stakeholders in an open, inclusive and transparent process. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Countries are encouraged to provide further information to qualify their responses and/or set them in the national context. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Guidelines are provided for each of the four main sections, each question, and each of the six thresholds for every single question, to ensure responses are as objective as possible, and are comparable both between countries, and between reporting periods. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve robust indicator results requires a country process involving a wide range of stakeholders which will require a certain amount of time and resources. The advantage of this is that it puts in place a process that addresses the integrated and indivisible nature of the SDG targets, as well as stressing the importance of &amp;#x201C;leaving no on behind&amp;#x201D;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Methodology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Computation method:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The survey contains 33 questions divided into the four main sections described above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Each question is given a score between 0 and 100, in increments of 10, guided by threshold descriptions for the following 6 categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Very low (0)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Low (20)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Medium-low (40)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Medium-high (60)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High (80)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Very high (100)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that guidance is provided for each threshold for each question, to ensure objective and comparable results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The un-weighted average of the question scores within each of the four sections is calculated to give a score of 0 &amp;#x2013; 100 for each section, rounded to the nearest whole number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. The section scores (rounded to the nearest whole number), are averaged (un-weighted), and rounded to the nearest whole number, to give the indicator score, expressed as a number between 0 and 100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Treatment of missing values:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;At country level:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator and survey have been designed for all countries to be able to submit an indicator value. A number of countries that did not submit a survey during the last round of data collection included fragile states / countries in conflict, or small island developing states. It is therefore estimated that the number of country responses under the SDG process will be in excess of 90%. Estimates for countries not responding to the survey will therefore not be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;At regional and global levels:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that the number of country responses will be in excess of 90%. This coverage of data will be deemed to be representative of global aggregates. Estimates for countries not responding to the survey will therefore not be made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Regional aggregates:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the Agenda 2030 principle of &amp;#x201C;leaving no one behind&amp;#x201D;, regional and global values will be based on simple, un-weighted averages of country scores. The country scores will be presented as a whole number, and regional and global averages will also be presented as a whole number. Global averages will be based on country values, not regional averages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional values may be assembled by regional bodies responsible for water resources in the region, such as the African Ministerial Council on Water (AMCOW), the European Environment Agency (EEA), and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for West Asia (ESCWA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;National focal points selected by each country. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data collection is via a simple questionnaire with 33 questions, in MS Word format. Responses to each question are given on a scale of 0 &amp;#x2013; 100, in increments of 10. Threshold descriptions are given for six thresholds between 0 and 100. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;National focal points are responsible for coordinating a national process to engage governmental and non-governmental stakeholders, as appropriate in the context of each country, to develop draft responses and finalise responses. This may be via email, workshops, and online notices. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The following materials are available for national focal points in 7 languages (English, Spanish, French, Arabic, Russian, Chinese, Portuguese), at &lt;a href=&quot;about:blank&quot;&gt;http://iwrmdataportal.unepdhi.org&lt;/a&gt;: the survey (MS Word); a detailed monitoring guide; and a PowerPoint presentation and video recording. In addition, focal points may access the following materials: the 2017 baseline surveys and 2-page results summaries (for 172 countries); and 2017 workshop reports (for 36 countries). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extensive explanations are provided in the monitoring guide and in the survey itself. The survey contains: an overall introduction and explanation; a glossary; an introduction and glossary in each of the four sections; threshold descriptions for six thresholds for each question; and a number of footnotes to explain aspects of questions or threshold descriptions. All materials can be downloaded from &lt;a href=&quot;about:blank&quot;&gt;http://iwrmdataportal.unepdhi.org&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, a dedicated Help Desk is available to provide assistance at all times. The Help Desk is accessible via email &lt;a href=&quot;about:blank&quot;&gt;iwrmsdg651@un.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Quality assurance:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following quality assurance guidelines are available to all individuals involved in quality assurance for 6.5.1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Process: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nominate person responsible for QA for a country response once it is submitted for the first time. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Acknowledge receipt and inform the country of QA process. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Update QA spreadsheet, indicating date of receipt and who submitted. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upload draft survey (MS Word) to the Dropbox folder. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Undertake ALL checks described below. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there are any discrepancies, revert to UNEP-DHI colleagues. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once action is agreed, respond to the countries. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Complete all checks on each subsequent version of the questionnaire until all quality issues are resolved and questionnaire is marked &amp;#x2018;final&amp;#x2019;.&amp;#xA0; &amp;#xA0; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checks: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focal point: Confirm the person submitting is the formal national focal point. If not, any reply should also add the national focal point in CC.&amp;#xA0; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Question responses: &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All questions answered. Official guidance is that all questions should be answered (either with a score or n/a). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scores in range from 0-100, in increments of 10. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check that n/a (not applicable) is used appropriately. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Free-text fields: In the &amp;#x201C;&amp;#x201C;Status description&amp;#x201D; and &amp;#x201C;Way forward&amp;#x201D; fields for each question, check that the free text make sense in the context of the score (and vice versa). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Calculations: Check that section averages and final score are rounded to the nearest whole number and correct, using the QA spreadsheet on Dropbox. Fill in the given responses in columns M - AX, and the differences are calculated automatically in columns C &amp;#x2013; G. If the difference is greater than +/- 0.5, the cells are automatically highlighted in red using conditional formatting. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compare with 2017 baseline: Where available, compare with 2017 baseline survey (for 172 countries) and discuss with colleagues as necessary.&amp;#xA0; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transboundary issues: &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the &amp;#x2018;transboundary basins&amp;#x2019; table in Annex B. A full list of transboundary basins can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;about:blank&quot;&gt;http://twap-rivers.org/indicators/Report.ashx?type=IndicatorResultsSummary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to the final worksheet/tab to see the countries in each basin. Also check the maps here: &lt;a href=&quot;about:blank&quot;&gt;http://twap-rivers.org/indicators/&lt;/a&gt; to see if the basin is likely to be important for that country, or if there is only a small portion of the basin in their country (in which case they may not list it). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the transboundary questions: 1.2c, 2.2e; 3.2d; and 4.2c, and see if these make sense in the context of the country. Island countries should give &amp;#x2018;n/a&amp;#x2019; for all of these questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All data is provided by each country and is therefore fully owned by the countries. Each country undertakes stakeholder consultation, to a level that is appropriate given resources and capacity available to them, to ensure that the data has adequate acceptance and ownership within the country. Guidance on consultation processes are provided in the monitoring guide and through the introductory powerpoint and video for focal points (all materials available at &lt;a href=&quot;about:blank&quot;&gt;http://iwrmdataportal.unepdhi.org&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strength of the indicator lies in the potential for disaggregating the country score into the four main dimensions of IWRM, and further to the questions in the survey. This provides countries with a quick assessment of which aspects of IWRM are progressing well, and which aspects require increased efforts to reach the target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of the target, indicator and survey does not lend itself to disaggregation by sex, age group, income etc. However, social equality is an integral part of IWRM, and there are questions which directly address issues such as gender, vulnerable groups, geographic coverage and broad stakeholder participation in water resources development and management. These questions provide an indication of the national and sub-national situation regarding social equality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As described in the &amp;#x201C;Data Sources&amp;#x201D; section below, there will be no internationally estimated data, with all data to be produced by countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;References&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Comme il mesure le degré de mise en œuvre d&apos;un environnement favorable à une meilleure gestion des ressources en eau, il soutient directement les autres objectifs de résultats de l&apos;ODD 6 (6.1 &amp;#x2013; 6.6). Pour ce faire, il fournit aux pays des informations complémentaires sur le contexte et les explications possibles des progrès réalisés sur d’autres objectifs, et souligne les obstacles et les moyens d’atteindre les autres objectifs. Il soutient également directement les objectifs de mise en œuvre 6.a et 6.b, car la désagrégation est possible de fournir des données sur le financement (6.a) et la participation des parties prenantes (6.b). Au-delà de l’ODD 6, l’indicateur 6.5.1 a des liens avec un certain nombre d’autres cibles à travers les ODD, car la gestion intégrée des ressources en eau vise à intégrer les exigences et les impacts sur les ressources en eau et les écosystèmes liés à l’eau d’un certain nombre de ODD différents et de leurs objectifs, y compris : la pauvreté (1.4); l’agriculture (2,3); l’éducation (4,7); genre (5,5); énergie (7,1); travail (8,5); égalité (10,2); zones urbaines (11,3); changement climatique (13,2); écosystèmes (15,9); gouvernance (16.3, 16.5 &amp;#x2013; 16.7) (ONU-Eau 2016). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Information institutionnelle&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Définition:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; L’indicateur 6.5.1 est &amp;#x2018;degré de mise en œuvre intégrée de la gestion des ressources en eau (0-100)&amp;#x2019;. Il mesure les étapes de développement et de mise en œuvre de la gestion intégrée des ressources en eau (IWRM), sur une échelle de 0 à 100, en six catégories (voir la section Justification). Le score de l’indicateur est calculé à partir d’une enquête par pays avec 33 questions, chaque question ayant été notée sur la même échelle de 0 à 100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; La définition de l’IWRM est basée sur une définition convenue au niveau international et est universellement applicable. L’IWRM a été officiellement créé en 1992 et est défini comme &amp;#x201C;, un processus qui favorise le développement et la gestion coordonnés de l’eau, des terres et des ressources connexes afin de maximiser le bien-être économique et social de manière équitable sans compromettre la durabilité des écosystèmes vitaux. &amp;#x201D; (GWP 2010). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; La méthode s’appuie sur les rapports officiels de l’ONU sur l’état de l’IWRM, de 2008 et 2012, du Plan de mise en œuvre de Johannesburg du Sommet mondial des Nations Unies pour le développement durable (1992). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Concepts:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Le concept d’IWRM est mesuré en 4 sections principales, chacune représentant la dimension clé de l’IWRM : &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 1. Environnement habilitant : cela inclut les politiques, les lois, les plans et les stratégies qui créent l’environnement habilitant &amp;#x2018;&amp;#x2019; pour l’IWRM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 2. Institutions et participation : comprend l’éventail et les rôles des institutions politiques, sociales, économiques et administratives qui aident à soutenir la mise en œuvre de l’IWRM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 3. Instruments de gestion : Outils et activités qui permettent aux décideurs et aux utilisateurs de faire des choix rationnels et éclairés entre des actions alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 4. Financement : Budgétisation et financement mis à disposition et utilisés pour le développement et la gestion des ressources en eau à partir de diverses sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; L’indicateur est basé sur une enquête nationale structurée autour de ces quatre sections principales. Chaque section est divisée en deux parties : les questions concernant le niveau national &amp;#x2018;&amp;#x2019; et &amp;#x2018;Autres niveaux&amp;#x2019; respectivement. &amp;#x2018; D’autres niveaux&amp;#x2019; incluent les sous-nationaux (y compris les provinces/États pour les pays fédérés), le niveau des bassins et le niveau transfrontalier, le cas échéant. Ces deux parties traitent du libellé de l’objectif 6.5 &amp;#x2018;implémenter [IWRM] à tous les niveaux &amp;#x2026;&amp;#x2019;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Sources de données&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le gouvernement national est responsable du suivi des progrès réalisés dans la mise en œuvre de l&apos;ODD 6.5 et en est propriétaire. Le gouvernement confiera à un ministère la responsabilité principale de superviser cette enquête, qui sera chargé de coordonner le processus national de surveillance et de production de rapports de l’IWRM. Comme les questions de gestion de l&apos;eau recoupent un grand nombre de secteurs, souvent supervisés par différents ministères et autres organes administratifs au niveau national ou autre, le processus doit être inclusif. Les principales parties prenantes devraient être impliquées afin de contribuer à des réponses bien informées et objectives à l&apos;enquête. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Le ministère est invité à désigner un point focal national &amp;#x201C;IWRM&amp;#x201D;, qui peut ou non être un fonctionnaire du gouvernement. L’ONU fournira un soutien si nécessaire et possible. Les étapes suivantes ne sont proposées qu’à titre d’orientation, car c’est aux pays de décider quel processus ou processus répondreait le mieux à leurs besoins. Il convient également de noter que les étapes suivantes représentent une approche &amp;#x2018;ladder&amp;#x2019;, en ce que l’achèvement de toutes les étapes mènera généralement à un indicateur plus robuste. Toutefois, il n’est peut-être pas possible ou nécessaire que tous les pays terminent toutes les étapes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 1. Le ministère responsable ou le point focal de l’IWRM communique avec d’autres ministères/organismes pertinents pour compiler les réponses au questionnaire. Chaque option de réponse possible a un score qui sera utilisé pour calculer le score global de l’indicateur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 2. Le projet de sondage terminé est examiné par les intervenants gouvernementaux. Ces parties prenantes pourraient inclure les acteurs des secteurs liés à l’eau, tels que l’agriculture, l’énergie, l’approvisionnement en eau et l’environnement, ainsi que la gestion de l’eau à différents niveaux administratifs. Ce processus peut être électronique (p. ex. par courriel) et/ou par le biais d’ateliers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 3. Le projet d’enquête révisé est validé lors d’un atelier multipartite. Outre les représentants du gouvernement, ces intervenants pourraient comprendre des associations d’usagers de l’eau, du secteur privé, des groupes d’intérêt qui s’intéressent à l’environnement, à l’agriculture, à la pauvreté et au milieu universitaire. Le processus proposé se fait par le biais d’un atelier, mais d’autres moyens de consultation, par exemple le courriel ou l’appel en ligne pour les présentations publiques, pourraient être envisagés. Notez que les étapes 2 et 3 pourraient être combinées si désiré. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 4. Le ministère responsable ou le point focal de l’IWRM discute avec les fonctionnaires concernés et consolide l’entrée dans une version finale. Cette version est à la base du calcul du degré de mise en œuvre de l’IWRM (0-100) pour les rapports mondiaux. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 5. Le ministère responsable soumet le score final de l’indicateur à l’Office national des statistiques chargé de compiler toutes les données cibles nationales des ODD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Sur la base de l’enquête nationale, ONU-Eau préparera périodiquement des rapports de synthèse aux niveaux régional et mondial afin de fournir des progrès globaux dans l’atteindre l’objectif 6.5 des ODD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Couverture temporelle : Un cycle de déclaration de trois ans est recommandé. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Processus de collecte: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les homologues officiels au niveau national supervisent le processus de validation et de consultation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L&apos;enquête a été conçue de manière à ce que l&apos;indicateur soit comparable entre les pays et les périodes. Aucun ajustement n&apos;est prévu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Calendrier&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Collecte de données : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; janvier &amp;#x2013; mai 2020 (5 mois). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Publication des données : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1er trimestre 2021&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Fournisseurs de données&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les informations requises pour répondre à l&apos;enquête doivent être détenues par les fonctionnaires responsables de la gestion des ressources en eau dans le pays, et doivent être étayées par des documents officiels. Par exemple, le ministère de l&apos;eau en coordination avec le ministère de l&apos;environnement, le ministère des finances, le ministère de la planification, le ministère des terres et de l&apos;agriculture, le ministère de l&apos;industrie et des mines, etc. Voir également la section &amp;#x2018; des sources de données &amp;#x2019; ci-dessus. Au minimum, un petit groupe de fonctionnaires peut être en mesure de remplir l&apos;enquête. Cependant, ces fonctionnaires peuvent appartenir à différentes autorités gouvernementales, et une coordination sera nécessaire pour déterminer et valider les réponses à chaque question. Une participation accrue des parties prenantes gouvernementales et non gouvernementales à la validation des scores des questions permettra d&apos;obtenir un score d&apos;indicateur plus solide et facilitera le suivi des progrès dans le temps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Compilateurs de données &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le PNUE et les partenaires de l&apos;ONU-Eau, dans le cadre de l&apos;initiative de l&apos;ONU-Eau sur le suivi intégré du ODD 6. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Raison d&apos;être :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L&apos;indicateur fournit une mesure directe des progrès réalisés dans la première partie de la cible 6.5 &amp;#x201C;&amp;#x2026; mettre en œuvre une gestion intégrée des ressources en eau à tous les niveaux &amp;#x2026;&amp;#x201D;. Le score de l&apos;indicateur fournit un moyen facile et compréhensible de mesurer les progrès vers la cible, avec &amp;#x2018;0&amp;#x2019; interprété comme une absence de mise en œuvre de la GIRE, et &amp;#x2018;100&amp;#x2019; interprété comme une mise en œuvre complète de la GIRE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pour faciliter l&apos;interprétation et la comparaison, les résultats des indicateurs peuvent être classés comme suit : &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Degré de mise en œuvre &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fourchette de points &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Interprétation générale pour la note globale de la GIRE &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Très élevé &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;91 - 100&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;La grande majorité des éléments de la GIRE sont pleinement mis en œuvre, les objectifs sont systématiquement atteints et les plans et programmes sont périodiquement évalués et révisés.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Haut &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;71 - 90&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Les objectifs de la GIRE des plans et programmes sont généralement atteints, et la couverture géographique et l&apos;engagement des parties prenantes sont généralement bons.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Medium-high&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;51 - 70&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;La capacité de mettre en œuvre les éléments de la GIRE est généralement adéquate, et ces éléments sont généralement mis en œuvre dans le cadre de programmes à long terme.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Medium-low&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;31 - 50&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;Les éléments de la GIRE sont généralement institutionnalisés et leur mise en œuvre est en cours. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Faible &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;11 - 30&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;La mise en œuvre des éléments de la GIRE a généralement commencé, mais avec une adoption limitée dans tout le pays et un engagement potentiellement faible des groupes de parties prenantes. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;Très faible &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;0 - 10&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;Le développement des éléments de la GIRE n&apos;a généralement pas commencé, ou est au point mort.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le concept de l&apos;enquête est qu&apos;elle fournit suffisamment d&apos;informations pour être réellement utile aux pays pour déterminer leurs progrès vers l&apos;objectif, et par ce biais, les différents aspects de la GIRE. Un équilibre a été recherché entre la fourniture d&apos;informations suffisantes pour couvrir les principes de base de la GIRE, et donc fournir une valeur d&apos;indicateur solide, et ne pas surcharger les pays avec des exigences de rapport inutiles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les pays sont encouragés à fournir des informations supplémentaires sur chaque question, qui peuvent aider à qualifier leur choix de score, et/ou à replacer ce score dans leur contexte national. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L&apos;indicateur 6.5.1 est étayé par l&apos;indicateur 6.5.2 &amp;#x201C;Proportion de la zone du bassin transfrontalier faisant l&apos;objet d&apos;un arrangement opérationnel de coopération dans le domaine de l&apos;eau &amp;#x201D;, qui porte directement sur la partie de la cible 6.5 &amp;#x201C; &amp;#x2026;, y compris par le biais de la coopération transfrontalière, le cas échéant &amp;#x201D;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Commentaires et limitations : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le défi de la subjectivité dans les réponses associées à ce type d&apos;enquête est abordé de plusieurs manières : &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Les projets de réponse sont examinés par un certain nombre de parties prenantes gouvernementales et non gouvernementales dans le cadre d&apos;un processus ouvert, inclusif et transparent. &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Les pays sont encouragés à fournir des informations complémentaires pour qualifier leurs réponses et/ou les replacer dans le contexte national. &lt;/li&gt;
  Des lignes directrices sont fournies pour chacune des quatre sections principales, chaque question et chacun des six seuils pour chaque question, afin de garantir que les réponses soient aussi objectives que possible et comparables entre les pays et entre les périodes de déclaration. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pour obtenir des indicateurs solides, il faut un processus national impliquant un large éventail de parties prenantes, ce qui demandera un certain temps et des ressources. L&apos;avantage de cette approche est qu&apos;elle met en place un processus qui tient compte de la nature intégrée et indivisible des objectifs des ODD, tout en soulignant l&apos;importance de &amp;#x201C; ne pas laisser de côté. &amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Méthodologie&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Méthode de calcul :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. L&apos;enquête contient 33 questions réparties dans les quatre grandes sections décrites ci-dessus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Chaque question reçoit une note entre 0 et 100, par tranche de 10, en fonction des descriptions des seuils pour les 6 catégories suivantes : &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Très faible (0)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Faible (20)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moyen-faible (40) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moyen-élevé (60) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Haut (80)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Très élevé (100)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Il convient de noter que des orientations sont fournies pour chaque seuil de chaque question, afin de garantir des résultats objectifs et comparables. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. La moyenne non pondérée des scores des questions dans chacune des quatre sections est calculée pour donner un score de 0 &amp;#x2013; 100 pour chaque section, arrondi au nombre entier le plus proche. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Les notes de section (arrondies au nombre entier le plus proche), sont moyennées (non pondérées), et arrondies au nombre entier le plus proche, pour donner la note de l&apos;indicateur, exprimée par un nombre entre 0 et 100. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Traitement des valeurs manquantes : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Au niveau national : &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L&apos;indicateur et l&apos;enquête ont été conçus pour tous les pays afin de pouvoir soumettre une valeur d&apos;indicateur. Un certain nombre de pays n&apos;ont pas soumis d&apos;enquête lors du dernier cycle de collecte de données, notamment les États fragiles/pays en conflit ou les petits États insulaires en développement. Il est donc estimé que le nombre de réponses des pays dans le cadre du processus des ODD sera supérieur à 90 %. Les estimations pour les pays n&apos;ayant pas répondu à l&apos;enquête ne seront donc pas faites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Au niveau régional et mondial : &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On estime que le nombre de réponses des pays dépassera 90 %. Cette couverture des données sera considérée comme représentative des agrégats mondiaux. Les estimations pour les pays ne répondant pas à l&apos;enquête ne seront donc pas faites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Agrégats régionaux : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conformément au principe de l&apos;Agenda 2030 &amp;#x201C; qui consiste à ne laisser personne derrière &amp;#x201D;, les valeurs régionales et mondiales seront basées sur des moyennes simples et non pondérées des scores des pays. Les scores des pays seront présentés comme un nombre entier, et les moyennes régionales et mondiales seront également présentées comme un nombre entier. Les moyennes mondiales seront basées sur les valeurs des pays, et non sur les moyennes régionales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les valeurs régionales peuvent être rassemblées par les organismes régionaux responsables des ressources en eau dans la région, tels que le Conseil ministériel africain sur l&apos;eau (AMCOW), l&apos;Agence européenne pour l&apos;environnement (AEE) et la Commission économique et sociale des Nations Unies pour l&apos;Asie occidentale (CESAO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Méthodes et orientations mises à la disposition des pays pour la compilation des données au niveau national :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Points focaux nationaux sélectionnés par chaque pays. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;La collecte des données se fait par le biais d&apos;un simple questionnaire de 33 questions, au format MS Word. Les réponses à chaque question sont données sur une échelle de 0 &amp;#x2013; 100, par incréments de 10. Les descriptions des seuils sont données pour six seuils entre 0 et 100. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Les points focaux nationaux sont chargés de coordonner un processus national visant à engager les parties prenantes gouvernementales et non gouvernementales, selon le contexte de chaque pays, à élaborer des projets de réponses et à finaliser les réponses. Cela peut se faire par courrier électronique, ateliers et avis en ligne. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Les documents suivants sont disponibles pour les points focaux nationaux en 7 langues (anglais, espagnol, français, arabe, russe, chinois, portugais), sur le site &lt;a href=&quot;about:blank&quot;&gt;http://iwrmdataportal.unepdhi.org&lt;/a&gt; : l&apos;enquête (MS Word), un guide de suivi détaillé, une présentation PowerPoint et un enregistrement vidéo. En outre, les points focaux peuvent accéder aux documents suivants : les enquêtes de référence de 2017 et les résumés des résultats de 2 pages (pour 172 pays) ; et les rapports des ateliers de 2017 (pour 36 pays). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Des explications détaillées sont fournies dans le guide de suivi et dans l&apos;enquête elle-même. L&apos;enquête contient : une introduction et une explication générales ; un glossaire ; une introduction et un glossaire dans chacune des quatre sections ; des descriptions des seuils pour six seuils pour chaque question ; et un certain nombre de notes de bas de page pour expliquer certains aspects des questions ou des descriptions des seuils. Tous les documents peuvent être téléchargés à partir du site &lt;a href=&quot;about:blank&quot;&gt;http://iwrmdataportal.unepdhi.org&lt;/a&gt;. En outre, un service d&apos;assistance dédié est disponible à tout moment pour fournir une assistance. Le service d&apos;assistance est accessible par courrier électronique &lt;a href=&quot;about:blank&quot;&gt;iwrmsdg651@un.org&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Assurance de la qualité : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les lignes directrices suivantes sont à la disposition de toutes les personnes impliquées dans l&apos;assurance qualité pour 6.5.1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processus : &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Désigner la personne responsable de l&apos;AQ pour une réponse d&apos;un pays une fois qu&apos;elle est soumise pour la première fois. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accuser réception et informer le pays du processus d&apos;assurance qualité. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mettre à jour la feuille de calcul de l&apos;AQ, en indiquant la date de réception et l&apos;auteur de la soumission. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Télécharger le projet d&apos;enquête (MS Word) dans le dossier Dropbox. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Effectuez TOUS les contrôles décrits ci-dessous. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;En cas de divergence, veuillez vous adresser à vos collègues du PNUE-DHI. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Une fois l&apos;action convenue, répondre aux pays. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Effectuer toutes les vérifications sur chaque version ultérieure du questionnaire jusqu&apos;à ce que tous les problèmes de qualité soient résolus et que le questionnaire soit marqué &amp;#x2018; final &amp;#x2019;. 850] &amp;#xA0; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Vérifications : &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Point focal : Confirmez que la personne qui soumet la demande est le point focal national officiel. Si ce n&apos;est pas le cas, toute réponse doit également ajouter le point focal national dans le CC. &amp;#xA0; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Réponses aux questions : &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Réponses à toutes les questions. Selon les directives officielles, il convient de répondre à toutes les questions (soit par une note, soit par s.o.). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Les notes vont de 0 à 100, par tranches de 10. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vérifiez que s.o. (sans objet) est utilisé de manière appropriée. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Champs de texte libre : Dans les champs &amp;#x201C;&amp;#x201C;Description du statut &amp;#x201D; et &amp;#x201C;Avancée &amp;#x201D; pour chaque question, vérifiez que le texte libre a un sens dans le contexte de la note (et vice versa). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Calculs : Vérifiez que les moyennes des sections et la note finale sont arrondies au nombre entier le plus proche et corrigez-les, en utilisant la feuille de calcul de l&apos;assurance qualité sur Dropbox. Remplissez les réponses données dans les colonnes M - AX, et les différences sont calculées automatiquement dans les colonnes C &amp;#x2013; G. Si la différence est supérieure à +/- 0,5, les cellules sont automatiquement surlignées en rouge en utilisant un formatage conditionnel. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Comparer avec la ligne de base de 2017 : Si possible, comparer avec l&apos;enquête de référence de 2017 (pour 172 pays) et en discuter avec des collègues si nécessaire. &amp;#xA0; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Questions transfrontalières : &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Voir le tableau &amp;#x2018;bassins transfrontaliers &amp;#x2019; de l&apos;annexe B. Une liste complète des bassins transfrontaliers peut être trouvée ici : &lt;a href=&quot;about:blank&quot;&gt;http://twap-rivers.org/indicators/Report.ashx?type=IndicatorResultsSummary&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allez à la dernière feuille de travail/onglet pour voir les pays de chaque bassin. Consultez également les cartes ici : &lt;a href=&quot;about:blank&quot;&gt;http://twap-rivers.org/indicators/&lt;/a&gt; pour voir si le bassin est susceptible d&apos;être important pour ce pays, ou s&apos;il n&apos;y a qu&apos;une petite partie du bassin dans leur pays (auquel cas ils peuvent ne pas l&apos;énumérer). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vérifiez les questions transfrontalières : 1.2c, 2.2e ; 3.2d ; et 4.2c, et voyez si elles ont un sens dans le contexte du pays. Les pays insulaires doivent donner &amp;#x2018;n/a &amp;#x2019; pour toutes ces questions &lt;/li&gt;.
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toutes les données sont fournies par chaque pays et sont donc entièrement détenues par les pays. Chaque pays entreprend une consultation des parties prenantes, à un niveau approprié compte tenu des ressources et des capacités dont il dispose, afin de s&apos;assurer que les données sont acceptées et appropriées dans le pays. Des conseils sur les processus de consultation sont fournis dans le guide de suivi et par le biais du powerpoint et de la vidéo d&apos;introduction pour les points focaux (tous les documents sont disponibles sur &lt;a href=&quot;about:blank&quot;&gt;http://iwrmdataportal.unepdhi.org&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Disponibilité des données &lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Désaggrégation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La force de l&apos;indicateur réside dans la possibilité de désagréger le score du pays dans les quatre dimensions principales de la GIRE, et en fonction des questions de l&apos;enquête. Cela permet aux pays d&apos;évaluer rapidement les aspects de la GIRE qui progressent bien et ceux qui nécessitent des efforts accrus pour atteindre l&apos;objectif. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La nature de la cible, de l&apos;indicateur et de l&apos;enquête ne se prête pas à une ventilation par sexe, tranche d&apos;âge, revenu, etc. Cependant, l&apos;égalité sociale fait partie intégrante de la GIRE, et certaines questions portent directement sur des aspects tels que le genre, les groupes vulnérables, la couverture géographique et la large participation des parties prenantes au développement et à la gestion des ressources en eau. Ces questions donnent une indication de la situation nationale et infranationale en matière d&apos;égalité sociale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources des divergences : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comme décrit dans la section &amp;#x201C; Sources de données&amp;#x201D; ci-dessous, il n&apos;y aura pas de données estimées au niveau international, toutes les données devant être produites par les pays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Références&lt;/h1&gt;

			<language lang="ru">&lt;p&gt;Цель 6: Обеспечение наличия и рационального использования водных ресурсов и санитарии для всех&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Задача 6.5: К 2030 году обеспечить комплексное управление водными ресурсами на всех уровнях, в том числе, при необходимости, на основе трансграничного сотрудничества&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Показатель 6.5.1: Степень внедрения комплексного управления водными ресурсами (от 0 до 100)&lt;/p&gt;Последнее обновление: 7 ноября 2019 года&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Связанные показатели &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Поскольку показатель отражает степень внедрения благоприятной среды для лучшего управления водными ресурсами, он напрямую поддерживает другие конечные цели в рамках ЦУР 6 (6.1 - 6.6). Это достигается путем предоставления странам дополнительной информации о контексте и возможном объяснении прогресса в достижении других целей, а также указывает на препятствия и факторы, способствующие достижению других целей. Он также напрямую поддерживает средства достижения целей 6.a и 6.b, поскольку дезагрегирование возможно для получения данных по финансированию (6.a) и участию заинтересованных сторон (6.b). Помимо ЦУР 6, показатель 6.5.1 связан с рядом других задач в рамках ЦУР, поскольку комплексное управление водными ресурсами связано с интеграцией требований и воздействий на водные ресурсы и связанные с водными ресурсами экосистемы со стороны ряда различных ЦУР и их задач, в том числе: бедность (1,4); сельское хозяйство (2,3); образование (4,7); пол (5,5); энергетика (7.1); работа (8.5); равенство (10.2); городские районы (11,3); изменение климата (13.2); экосистемы (15,9); управление (16.3, 16.5 - 16.7) (Механизм «ООН – Водные ресурсы» за 2016 год).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Институциональная информация &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Организация(и): &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Программа Организации Объединенных Наций по окружающей среде (ЮНЕП) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Понятия и определения &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Определение: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Показатель 6.5.1 - «степень внедрения комплексного управления водными ресурсами (0-100)». Он отражает этапы разработки и внедрения комплексного управления водными ресурсами (КУВР) по шкале от 0 до 100 баллов по шести категориям (см. раздел «Обоснование»). Значение показателя рассчитывается на основе вопросника странового обследования, состоящего из 33 вопросов, при этом каждый вопрос оценивается по одной и той же шкале от 0 до 100 баллов. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Определение КУВР основано на международно согласованном определении и использует универсальные принципы. КУВР было официально учреждено в 1992 году и определяется как &quot;процесс, который способствует скоординированному развитию и управлению водными, земельными и связанными с ними ресурсами с целью максимального повышения экономического и социального благосостояния на справедливой основе без ущерба для устойчивости жизненно важных экосистем&quot;. (Глобальное водное партнерство (ГВП) 2010 год). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Метод основан на официальных отчетах ООН о состоянии КУВР за 2008 и 2012 годы Йоханнесбургского плана выполнения решений Всемирного саммита ООН по устойчивому развитию (1992 год).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Понятия: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Понятие КУВР состоит из 4 основных разделов, каждый из которых представляет собой ключевой аспект КУВР: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 1. Благоприятная среда: сюда входят правила, законы, планы и стратегии, которые создают &quot;благоприятную среду&quot; для КУВР. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 2. Институты и участие: включает контингент и роли политических, социальных, экономических и административных институтов, которые помогают поддерживать внедрение КУВР. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 3. Инструменты управления: инструменты и действия, которые позволяют лицам, принимающим решения, и пользователям делать рациональный и осознанный выбор между альтернативными действиями. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 4. Финансирование: составление бюджета и финансирование из различных источников, предоставляемые и используемые для развития и управления водными ресурсами. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Показатель основан на национальном обследовании, включающем эти четыре основных раздела. Каждый раздел разделен на две части: вопросы, касающиеся &quot;Национального уровня&quot; и &quot;Других уровней&quot; соответственно. Часть &quot;Другие уровни&quot; включает субнациональный (включая провинции / штаты для стран с федеративным устройством), бассейновый и трансграничный уровень, в зависимости от ситуации. Эти две части касаются формулировки Целевого показателя 6.5 «Реализация [комплексного управления водными ресурсами (КУВР)] на всех уровнях». &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Источники данных &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Описание: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Мониторинг прогресса в достижении ЦУР 6.5 находится в ведении правительства страны и является его обязанностью. Правительство назначает министерство, несущее основную ответственность за надзор за проведением этого обследования, которому будет предложено взять на себя ответственность за координацию национального процесса мониторинга и отчетности КУВР. Поскольку вопросы управления водными ресурсами затрагивают широкий круг секторов, которые часто контролируются различными министерствами и другими административными органами на национальном или других уровнях, то этот процесс должен быть инклюзивным, т.е. проходить с участием всех заинтересованных сторон. Необходимо привлечь основные заинтересованные стороны с тем, чтобы они внесли свой вклад в формулирование достаточно информативных и объективных ответов в рамках обследования. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Министерству предлагается назначить национального &quot;координатора по КУВР&quot;, который может быть или не быть государственным чиновником. ООН будет оказывать поддержку там, где это необходимо и возможно. Нижеследующие шаги предлагаются только в качестве руководства, поскольку страны сами решают, какой процесс или процессы лучше всего удовлетворят их потребности. Также следует отметить, что указанные шаги представляют собой &quot;лестничный&quot; подход, в котором выполнение всех шагов обычно приводит к получению более надежного показателя. Однако выполнение всех этапов может оказаться невозможным или необязательным для всех стран. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 1. Ответственное министерство или координатор КУВР связывается с другими соответствующими министерствами / ведомствами для формулирования ответов на вопросник. Для каждого возможного варианта ответа существует оценка, которая будет использоваться для расчета общей балльной оценки показателя. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 2. Заполненный проект отчета об обследовании рассматривается заинтересованными сторонами в правительстве. Эти заинтересованные стороны могут включать тех, кто вовлечен в секторы, имеющие отношение к водным ресурсам, такие как сельское хозяйство, энергетика, водоснабжение и окружающая среда, а также управление водными ресурсами на различных административных уровнях. Этот процесс может реализовываться в электронном формате (например, с использованием электронной почты) и / или посредством проведения семинаров. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 3. Проверенный проект отчета об обследовании утверждается на семинаре с участием многих заинтересованных сторон. Помимо представителей правительства, эти заинтересованные стороны могут включать ассоциации водопользователей, частный сектор, заинтересованные группы, например, связанные с окружающей средой, сельским хозяйством, вопросами бедности и представителей научных кругов. Предлагаемый процесс - семинар, но могут быть рассмотрены альтернативные способы проведения консультаций, например: посредством использования электронной почты или онлайн-звонков для публичного представления материалов. Обратите внимание, что шаги 2 и 3 при желании можно объединить. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 4. Ответственное министерство или координатор КУВР проводит обсуждение с соответствующими официальными лицами и объединяет полученные данные в окончательную версию. Эта версия является основой для расчета степени внедрения КУВР (0-100) для глобальной отчетности. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 5. Ответственное министерство представляет окончательную оценку показателя в национальное статистическое управление, отвечающее за сбор всех национальных данных по целевым показателям ЦУР. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; На основе национального обследования Механизм «ООН-Водные ресурсы» будет периодически подготавливать сводные отчеты для регионального и глобального уровней, чтобы обеспечить общий прогресс в достижении цели 6.5 ЦУР. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Временной охват: рекомендуется применять трехлетний цикл отчетности.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Процесс сбора: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Официальные партнеры на страновом уровне контролируют процесс валидации и проведения консультаций. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Обследование было разработано таким образом, чтобы показатель был сопоставим по странам и временным периодам. Никаких корректировок не предвидится. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Календарь &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Сбор данных: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Январь - май 2020 года (5 месяцев). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Выпуск данных: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 1 квартал 2021 года &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Поставщики данных &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ожидается, что информация, необходимая для заполнения отчета об обследовании, будет подтверждаться государственными чиновниками, ответственными за управление водными ресурсами в стране, и будет подкрепляться официальной документацией. Например. Министерством водных ресурсов в сотрудничестве с Министерством окружающей среды, Министерством финансов, Министерством планирования, Министерством земель и сельского хозяйства, Министерством промышленности и горнодобывающей отрасли и т. д. См. также раздел &quot;Источники данных&quot; выше. Как минимум, небольшая группа должностных лиц может заполнить отчет об обследовании. Однако эти государственные служащие могут принадлежать к разным государственным органам и для формулирования и валидации ответов на каждый вопрос потребуется координация между ними. Более активное участие государственных и негосударственных заинтересованных сторон в валидации балльных оценок ответов на вопросы приведет к более надежной балльной оценке показателей и облегчит отслеживание прогресса в динамике по времени. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Составители данных &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Партнеры ЮНЕП и Механизма «ООН-водные ресурсы» в рамках инициативы «ООН-водные ресурсы» по комплексному мониторингу достижения ЦУР 6. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Обоснование: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Показатель обеспечивает прямую оценку хода выполнения первой части задачи 6.5 «...обеспечить комплексное управление водными ресурсами на всех уровнях...». Балльная оценка показателя обеспечивает простой и понятный способ оценки прогресса в достижении цели, которая при значении &quot;0&quot; интерпретируется как отсутствие реализации КУВР, а при значении &quot;100&quot; интерпретируется как полная реализация КУВР. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Для облегчения интерпретации и сравнения результаты разработки показателя можно разделить на следующие категории: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Степень реализации &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Диапазон балльных оценок &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Общая интерпретация полной оценки КУВР &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Очень высокая &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; 91 - 100 &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Подавляющее большинство элементов КУВР полностью реализовано, цели последовательно достигаются, а планы и программы периодически оцениваются и пересматриваются. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Высокая &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; 71–90 &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Цели планов и программ КУВР в целом достигаются, а географический охват и взаимодействие с заинтересованными сторонами в основном хорошие.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Средне-высокая &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; 51–70 &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Потенциал для реализации элементов ИУВР в целом достаточен, и элементы в основном реализуются в рамках долгосрочных программ. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Средне-низкая &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; 31–50 &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Элементы КУВР в целом институционализированы, и процесс реализации продолжается.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Низкая &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; 11–30 &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Внедрение элементов КУВР в целом началось, но с ограниченным распространением по стране и потенциально низким вовлечением групп заинтересованных сторон. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Очень низкая &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; 0–10 &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Разработка элементов КУВР вообще не началась или застопорилась.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Идея обследования заключается в том, что оно предоставляет достаточно информации, которая будет иметь реальную значимость для стран при определении прогресса в достижении цели, а, следовательно, и в различных аспектах КУВР. Был найден баланс между предоставлением информации, достаточной для охвата основных принципов КУВР и, таким образом, предоставляя надежное значение показателя, и отсутствием излишней нагрузки на страны, которая может быть обусловлена ничем не оправданными излишними требованиями к отчетности. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Странам рекомендуется предоставлять дополнительную информацию по каждому вопросу, которая может помочь уточнить их выбор балльной оценки и / или учесть этот балл в контексте своей страны. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Показатель 6.5.1 поддерживается показателем 6.5.2 «Доля трансграничных водных бассейнов, охваченных действующими договоренностями о сотрудничестве в области водопользования», который непосредственно касается части задачи 6.5 &quot;...в том числе, при необходимости, на основе трансграничного сотрудничества&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Комментарии и ограничения: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Проблема субъективности в ответах, связанных с этим типом обследования, решается несколькими способами: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Проекты ответов рассматриваются рядом правительственных и неправительственных заинтересованных сторон в рамках открытого, инклюзивного и прозрачного процесса. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Странам рекомендуется предоставлять дополнительную информацию, чтобы уточнить свои ответы и / или изложить их в национальном контексте. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Руководящие принципы представлены для каждого из четырех основных разделов, каждого вопроса и каждого из шести пороговых значений для каждого отдельного вопроса, чтобы ответы были максимально объективными и были сопоставимы как между странами, так и между отчетными периодами. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Для достижения надежных результатов по показателям требуется организовать страновой процесс с участием широкого круга заинтересованных сторон, что потребует определенного количества времени и ресурсов. Преимущество этого подхода состоит в том, что он вводит в действие процесс, который учитывает интегрированный и неделимый характер целей ЦУР, а также подчеркивает важность принципа «никто не должен быть оставлен позади».&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Методология &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Метод расчета: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 1. Обследование включает в себя 33 вопроса, разделенных на четыре основных раздела, описанных выше. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 2. Каждому вопросу присваивается балльная оценка от 0 до 100 баллов с шагом в 10 баллов в соответствии с описанием пороговых значений для следующих 6 категорий: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Очень низкая (0) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Низкая (20) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Средне-низкая (40) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Средне-высокая (60) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Высокая (80) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Очень высокая (100) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Обратите внимание, что руководство предоставляется для каждого порогового значения по каждому вопросу с тем, чтобы обеспечить объективные и сопоставимые результаты. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 3. Невзвешенное среднее значение баллов за ответы на вопросы в каждом из четырех разделов рассчитывается так, чтобы получить оценку 0 - 100 баллов для каждого раздела, округленную до ближайшего целого числа. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 4. Баллы по разделам (округленные до ближайшего целого числа), усредняются (невзвешенные) и округляются до ближайшего целого числа, чтобы получить балл показателя, выраженный числом от 0 до 100. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Обработка отсутствующих значений: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt; На страновом уровне: &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Показатель и обследование были разработаны для всех стран для того , чтобы иметь возможность рассчитать значение показателя. В число стран, которые не представили отчеты по обследованию в рамках последнего раунда сбора данных, относятся нестабильные государства / страны, находящиеся в состоянии конфликта, или малые островные развивающиеся государства. Таким образом, оценочно количество ответов стран по процессу достижения ЦУР превысит 90-процентный уровень. Поэтому оценки для стран, не представивших отчеты по обследованию, производиться не будут.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt; На региональном и глобальном уровнях: &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; По оценкам, количество ответов стран превысит 90-процентный уровень. Этот охват данных будет считаться репрезентативным для глобальных агрегатов. Поэтому оценки для стран, не представивших отчет по обследованию, производиться не будут.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Региональные агрегаты:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; В соответствии с принципом Повестки дня на период до 2030 года &quot;никто не должен быть оставлен позади&quot;, региональные и глобальные значения будут основаны на простых невзвешенных средних балльных показателях стран. Баллы по странам будут представлены в виде целого числа и средние региональные и глобальные показатели также будут представлены в виде целого числа. Для расчета глобальных средних значений будут использоваться значения стран, а не средние региональные значения. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Региональные значения могут быть получены региональными органами, ответственными за водные ресурсы в регионе, такими как Африканский совет министров по водным ресурсам (AMCOW), Европейское агентство по окружающей среде (EEA) и Экономическая и социальная комиссия Организации Объединенных Наций для Западной Азии (ЭСКЗА). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Доступные странам методы и руководства для составления данных на национальном уровне: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Национальные координаторы выбираются каждой страной. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Сбор данных осуществляется с помощью простого вопросника, состоящего из 33 вопросов в формате MS Word. Ответы на каждый вопрос оцениваются по шкале от 0 до 100 баллов с шагом 10 баллов. Описание пороговых значений дано для шести пороговых значений от 0 до 100 баллов. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Национальные координаторы несут ответственность за согласование национального процесса по привлечению правительственных и неправительственных заинтересованных сторон, в зависимости от контекста каждой страны, в разработку проектов ответов и окончательное формулирование ответов. Это работа может быть организована с использованием электронной почты, путем организации семинаров и онлайн-уведомлений. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Следующие материалы доступны для национальных координаторов на 7 языках (английском, испанском, французском, арабском, русском, китайском, португальском) по адресу &lt;a href=&quot;about:blank&quot;&gt; http://iwrmdataportal.unepdhi.org &lt;/a&gt;: обследование (в формате MS Word); подробное руководство по мониторингу; презентация в формате PowerPoint и видеозапись. Кроме того, координаторы могут получить доступ к следующим материалам: базовые исследования 2017 года и двухстраничные сводки результатов (по 172 странам); и отчеты семинаров за 2017 год (по 36 странам). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Подробные пояснения приведены в руководстве по мониторингу и в материалах самого обследования. Обследование содержит: общее введение и объяснение; глоссарий; введение и глоссарий в каждом из четырех разделов; описания пороговых значений для шести пороговых значений для каждого вопроса; и ряд сносок, объясняющих аспекты вопросов или описаний пороговых значений. Все материалы можно скачать с &lt;a href=&quot;about:blank&quot;&gt; http://iwrmdataportal.unepdhi.org &lt;/a&gt;. Кроме того, специальная служба поддержки доступна для оказания помощи в любое время. Служба поддержки доступна по адресу электронной почты &lt;a href=&quot;about:blank&quot;&gt; iwrmsdg651@un.org &lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Обеспечение качества: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Следующие рекомендации по обеспечению качества доступны всем лицам, участвующим в обеспечении качества показателя 6.5.1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Процесс:&lt;li&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Назначение человека, ответственного за обеспечение качества ответа от страны, когда ответ будет готовиться к отправке в первый раз. &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; Подтверждение получения и информирование страны о процессе контроля качества. &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; Обновление таблицы контроля качества с указанием даты получения и того, кто отправил материал. &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; Загрузка черновика отчета по обследованию (MS Word) в папку Dropbox. &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; Выполнение ВСЕХ проверок, описанных ниже. &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; Если есть какие-либо расхождения, обратитесь к коллегам из UNEP-DHI (Программа ООН по окружающей среде – Датский институт гидравлики (ЮНЕП-ДИГ)). &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; Направление ответа странам после согласования действий. &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; Проведение всех проверок каждой последующей версии вопросника, пока все проблемы с качеством не будут решены и вопросник не будет помечен как &quot;завершен&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Проверки: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Координатор: подтверждение, что лицо, представившее отчет, является официальным национальным координатором. Если нет, то в любом ответе в копии следует также добавить адрес национального координатора.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Ответы на вопросы: &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Подготовить ответы на все вопросы. Официальное руководство гласит, что на все вопросы следует отвечать (либо баллами, либо н / п). &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; Баллы в диапазоне от 0 до 100 с шагом 10 баллов. &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; Убедитесь, что н / п (не применимо) используется надлежащим образом. &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; Поля произвольного текста: в &quot;Описании статуса&quot; и &quot;Путь вперед&quot; поля для каждого вопроса убедитесь, что свободный текст имеет смысл в контексте оценки (и наоборот). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Вычисления. Убедитесь, что средние и окончательные оценки по разделам округлены до ближайшего целого числа и верны, используя таблицу контроля качества в Dropbox. Заполните данные ответы в столбцах M - AX, и различия будут рассчитаны автоматически в столбцах C - G. Если разница больше +/- 0,5, ячейки автоматически выделяются красным цветом с использованием условного форматирования. &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; Сравните с базовым показателем 2017 года: если возможно, сравните со значением базового обследования 2017 года (имеются по 172 странам) и при необходимости обсудите с коллегами.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Трансграничные проблемы: &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Проверьте таблицу &quot;трансграничные бассейны&quot; в Приложении B. Полный список трансграничных бассейнов можно найти здесь: &lt;a href=&quot;about:blank&quot;&gt; http://twap-rivers.org/indicators/Report.ashx?type=IndicatorResultsSummary &lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Переход на последнюю таблицу / вкладку, чтобы увидеть страны в каждом бассейне. Также проверьте карты здесь: &lt;a href=&quot;about:blank&quot;&gt; http://twap-rivers.org/indicators/ &lt;/a&gt;, чтобы узнать, может ли бассейн иметь важное значение для этой страны или есть только небольшая часть бассейна в их стране (в этом случае они не могут ее включать). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Проверьте трансграничные вопросы: 1.2c, 2.2e; 3.2d; и 4.2c, и посмотрите, имеют ли они смысл в контексте страны. Островные страны должны представлять &quot;н / п&quot; по всем этим вопросам. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Все данные предоставлены каждой страной и, следовательно, полностью принадлежат странам. Каждая страна проводит консультации с заинтересованными сторонами на уровне, который соответствует имеющимся у них ресурсам и возможностям, чтобы гарантировать, что данные имеют адекватное признание и право собственности в стране. Рекомендации по процессам консультаций представлены в руководстве по мониторингу, а также во вводной презентации и видео для координаторов (все материалы доступны на &lt;a href=&quot;about:blank&quot;&gt; http://iwrmdataportal.unepdhi.org &lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;h1&gt; Доступность данных &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Описание: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Общее количество стран: 172 (89% государств-членов ООН) (ЮНЕП 2018 года) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Следующие данные относятся к региону (региональные группы СОООН): затем следует количество стран с данными / общее количество стран в регионе (по состоянию на 2017 год); затем следует процент стран, по которым имеются данные. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Австралия и Новая Зеландия: 2/2; 100% &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Центральная и Южная Азия: 10/14; 71% &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Восточная и Юго-Восточная Азия: 13/16; 81% &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Европа и Северная Америка: 43/45; 96% &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Латинская Америка и Карибский бассейн: 29/33; 89% &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Северная Африка и Западная Азия: 22/23; 96% &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Океания (за исключением Австралии и Новой Зеландии): 8/12; 67% &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Страны Африки к югу от Сахары: 45/48; 94% &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Мир: 172/193: 89% &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Временные ряды: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Предварительные ЦУР: 2008, 2012 годы (Механизм «ООН — Водные ресурсы» 2008, 2012 годы). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Период ЦУР: 2017 год (ЮНЕП 2018 год). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Все на портале КУВР (&lt;a href=&quot;about:blank&quot;&gt; http://iwrmdataportal.unepdhi.org &lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Дезагрегирование: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Сильной стороной показателя является возможность дезагрегировать оценку страны по четырем основным параметрам КУВР, а также по вопросам, содержащимся в обследовании. Это позволяет странам быстро оценить, какие аспекты КУВР успешно развиваются, а какие требуют дополнительных усилий для достижения цели. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Характер цели, показателя и обследования не поддается дезагрегации по полу, возрастным группам, доходам и т. д. Однако социальное равенство является неотъемлемой частью КУВР, и есть вопросы, которые напрямую касаются таких вопросов, как пол, уязвимые группы, географический охват и широкое участие заинтересованных сторон в развитии и управлении водными ресурсами. Эти вопросы дают представление о национальной и субнациональной ситуации в отношении социального равенства.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Источники расхождений: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Как описано в разделе &quot;Источники данных&quot; ниже, международных оценок данных не будет, а все данные будут предоставлены странами. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Ссылки &lt;/h1&gt;
