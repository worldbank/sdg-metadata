Exposure-response function: </p>\n<p>The integrated exposure-response functions (IER) developed for the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project 2010 and 2013 (Burnett et al, 2014 and Forouzanfar et al, 2015) were used. These IERs were updated using the most recent epidemiological evidence identified through a systematic search of studies on particulate matter and mortality, for the five outcomes of interest. </p>\n<p>The exposure-response function captures the magnitude of the death risks due to the exposure to air pollution by integrating epidemiological evidence from four sources of PM: ambient air pollution, household air pollution, active smoking, and second-hand smoking; and excluding the possible effects of other risk factors on the outcomes of interest. Due that, it is possible to assess the attributable burden due to household and ambient air pollution using the same IERs. </p>\n<p>The IER has recently been included and is available for download in the AirQ+ software tool for health risk assessment of air pollution, version 2.2 (released in March the 14<sup>th</sup>, 2023).</p>\n<p>C.
