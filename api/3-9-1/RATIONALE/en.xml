	<data>&lt;p&gt;As part of a broader project to assess major risk factors to health, the mortality resulting from exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution and household (indoor) air pollution from polluting fuel use for cooking was assessed. Ambient air pollution results from emissions from industrial activity, households, cars and trucks which are complex mixtures of air pollutants, many of which are harmful to health. Of all of these pollutants, fine particulate matter has the greatest effect on human health. By polluting fuels is understood as wood, coal, animal dung, charcoal, and crop wastes, as well as kerosene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air pollution is the biggest environmental risk to health. The majority of the burden is borne by the populations in low and middle-income countries. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
