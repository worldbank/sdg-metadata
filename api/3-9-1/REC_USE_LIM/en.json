{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 3-9-1, translated into en","data":"<p>An approximation of the combined effects of risk factors (i.e., ambient and household air pollution) is possible if independence and little correlation between risk factors with impacts on the same diseases can be assumed (Ezzati et al, 2003). In the case of air pollution, however, there are some limitations to estimate the joint effects: limited knowledge on the distribution of the population exposed to both household and ambient air pollution, correlation of exposures at individual level as household air pollution is a contributor to ambient air pollution, and non-linear interactions (Lim et al, 2012; Smith et al, 2014). In several regions, however, household air pollution remains mainly a rural issue, while ambient air pollution is predominantly an urban problem. Also, in some continents, many countries are relatively unaffected by household air pollution, while ambient air pollution is a major concern. If assuming independence and little correlation, a rough estimate of the total impact can be calculated, which is less than the sum of the impact of the two risk factors.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, as the IER function integrates epidemiological evidence from four sources of PM (i.e., ambient air pollution, household air pollution, active smoking and second-hand smoking), some assumptions are assumed. Specifically, the relative risk at any concentration is independent of the source of PM2.5, and only dependent on the magnitude of the total exposure from all sources together (Burnett et al, 2020).</p>"}
