			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The Department of Statistics (STATISTICS) works to provide relevant, timely and reliable labour statistics, to develop international standards for better measurement of labour issues and enhanced international comparability, and to help member States develop and improve their labour statistics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Employment Policy Department (EMPLOYMENT) is responsible for promoting full and productive employment by developing integrated employment, development and skills policies (ILO, 2012) that are inclusive, gender sensitive and sustainable. The department is mandated to coordinate ILO efforts to promote decent job opportunities for young women and men; over the years, it has supported the formulation, implementation and review of national youth employment strategies and action plans in different countries and regions (ILO, 2008; ILO, 2015). This type of targeted action and related achievements have been included in the ILO programming framework and performance system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ILO supports its constituents and other development stakeholders through knowledge and capacity building as well as through policy advocacy and advice. The list of references at the end of this note offers examples of recent major ILO contributions to knowledge building on youth employment and youth employment policy (ILO, 2017). &lt;/p&gt;
