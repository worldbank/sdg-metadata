  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Global survey for data collection&lt;/em&gt;: Requesting responsible national entities to provide relevant information and support documents; a survey questionnaire is developed and administered by the ILO with biennial frequency to assess progress.This will be complemented by regular information and updates from ILO country offices on development, adoption and implementation of youth employment policies in countries covered by these offices, every year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data compilation&lt;/em&gt;: by the ILO; disseminated through ILOSTAT, a new repository dedicated to Indicator 8.b.1 and the active use of YouthPOL, EmPol and other databases (e.g. NATLEX &amp;#x2013; the ILO database of national labour, social security and related human rights legislation), as appropriate. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data validation&lt;/em&gt;: Regular quality checks are conducted on all data, in particular when: (i) an already available document has not been directly provided by the government itself; (ii) it is unclear if the strategy and related action plan have been officially adopted; or (iii) there are doubts regarding the implementation of the strategy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
