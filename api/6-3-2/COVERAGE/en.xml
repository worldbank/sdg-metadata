	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data availability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An initial baseline data collection has been conducted in 2017 with 48 country data submissions as of February 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time series:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second reporting cycle 2020: 89 submissions as of February 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the level of detail provided by countries in their submissions, the indicator can be disaggregated by water body type (river, lake, groundwater) and river basin district. This disaggregated data can support informed decision-making at the national and sub-national scale to monitor and improve water quality management measures.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
