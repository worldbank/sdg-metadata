	<message>The UNIT_MEASURE field for indicator 6-3-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The&lt;strong&gt; proportion&lt;/strong&gt; of the number of bodies of water with good water quality to the total number of assessed water bodies in percent. To classify whether a water body is of &amp;#x201C;good ambient water quality&amp;#x201D; or not, a threshold is applied where 80 per cent or more of monitoring values meet their target values. This is then applied in turn to the Reporting Basin District, and then to the national level to generate the national indicator score.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
