	<data>&lt;p&gt;Percent (%): The&lt;strong&gt; proportion&lt;/strong&gt; of the number of bodies of water with good water quality compared to the total number of assessed water bodies expressed as a percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To classify whether a water body is of &amp;#x201C;good ambient water quality&amp;#x201D; or not, a threshold is applied where 80 percent or more of monitoring values meet their target values. The number of water bodies that are classified as either good ambient water quality or not can be reported at the Reporting Basin District, and then at the national level to generate the national indicator score.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
