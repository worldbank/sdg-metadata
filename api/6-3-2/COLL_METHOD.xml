At the national level, data reports are provided by the GEMS/Water National Focal Points or any other official counterpart appointed by the respective government. GEMS/Water offers consultation and support in selecting and compiling the required monitoring data, defining suitable river basin districts and delineating water bodies, as well as computing the indicator, upon request through its helpdesk. Data reported by the countries are checked for consistency with respect to the monitoring parameters, target values and spatial units and compared with monitoring data available in GEMStat, if applicable. &lt;/p&gt;
