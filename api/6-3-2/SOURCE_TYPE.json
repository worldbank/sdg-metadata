Additional water quality monitoring data from research or citizen-science monitoring programmes can be used to supplement the available authoritative monitoring data, provided they are authorised by the national reporting agency.</p>\n<p>The number of monitoring locations required to determine the quality status of a water body depends on the type and size of the water body, but a minimum of one monitoring location per water body is required. The minimum data requirements for calculating this indicator are measurements for all of the recommended or alternative core parameters appropriate to the type of water body as defined in the methodology. </p>\n<p>Measurements should be taken routinely, at prescribed intervals, or the same time of year each year, from the same locations. Even if new monitoring stations are introduced, data should continue to be collected from the original locations. This ensures that results are comparable between reports, thereby enabling trends to be established over time. The monitoring data needed for the indicator computation may be collected by different monitoring programmes involving different agencies and organizations. It is therefore important to establish and maintain centralized data repositories at the national level that collate the data from the various stakeholders, ensuring compatibility in reporting units between all agencies submitting data. Data should be compiled for each core parameter at each sampling location in order to calculate the indicator.</p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
