&lt;p&gt;Following the initial submission, the Helpdesk undertakes several checks on the data and calrifies any irregularities with the country technical focal point until both sides agree to finalize the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data is then submitted to the UNEP SDG focal point, who collates all indicators data for which UNEP is the Custodian Agency, where a further quality check is undertaken, prior to submission to the SDG Global Database.&lt;/p&gt;
