			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The monitoring and reporting of SDG Indicator 6.3.2 requires considerable national financial and human capacities to regularly measure water quality parameters at sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions, and to consistently collect, quality-assure and process the monitoring data to compute the indicator. Substantial investments in monitoring and data management infrastructures, as well as targeted capacity development in water quality monitoring programme design and operation, will be required in many countries to enhance national capacities to regularly and consistently report on the indicator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the differences in monitoring and data processing capacities among countries, the indicator methodology offers a progressive monitoring approach allowing countries to start with reporting based on their existing capacity and progressively enhance the data coverage and indicator significance with increasing capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 1 monitoring includes a set of general, easily measurable, physico-chemical water quality parameters that can indicate water quality degradation. They can be used to assess the quality status of water bodies, facilitating global comparability and maintaining a balance between the significance of the indicator and the monitoring requirements for each country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 2 monitoring allows countries with enhanced capacities to include additional water quality parameters, such as toxic substances and biological monitoring, as well as more sophisticated quality classification schemes to assess and report on the quality of their water bodies more accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
