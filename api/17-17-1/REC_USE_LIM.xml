			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The limitations of the proposed indicator is that it does not account for other sectors such as education and health may account for a significant part of PPPs but they are not captured by the database. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The database only covers low and middle income countries (World Bank classification) and it does not collect the indicator for high income countries. Expanding the data to include high income countries as well as PPPs in other sector beyond infrastructure is something that the World Bank is considering but it is currently limited by budget constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, PPI database does not collect data on civil society partnerships and this will not fit the currently methodology of data gathering and is outside the present work&amp;#x2019;s scope.&lt;/p&gt;
