			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Regional and global aggregates are calculated by adding investment values of all countries in that region or globally without any weight assigned. The only adjustment that the data does is to account only once cross border projects, i.e. projects that involve more than one country and therefore have a unique project investment value. Cross border projects are counted for each country when data is presented at country level but only once when data is aggregated at regional or global level.&lt;/p&gt;
