	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 17-17-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To our knowledge, countries do not produce estimates of this indicator. Some PPP units in very few countries have data available in their website but it is neither presented in a cross- country comparable approach nor annually reported.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
