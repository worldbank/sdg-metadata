	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 17-17-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existing PPI database includes data on 6,400 projects over 28 years (1990-2019), with over 50 variables per project. It covers projects in 139 low and middle income countries as classified by the World Bank. The list of countries is reviewed every five years in order to maintain continuity in the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is available since 1990 and data can be disaggregated on the monthly basis (i.e total investments in infrastructure PPP projects that reached financial closure in a particular month since 1990).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit of analysis is the PPP project; therefore, data can be disaggregated at the project level. There is data on sector and subsector as well as geographical location of the project at the subnational level and therefore it can be later aggregated by municipality, province, country or region.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
