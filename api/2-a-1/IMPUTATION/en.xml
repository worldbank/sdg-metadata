&lt;p&gt;Missing values of -2019 government expenditure in agriculture were forecasted using trends in GDP and 3 to 5 year moving averages of the share of agriculture in total expenditure. Forecasted values are employed to compute regional and global aggregates, but not presented at the national level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At regional and global levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
