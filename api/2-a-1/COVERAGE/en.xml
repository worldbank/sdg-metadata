	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 2-a-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data are reported for the highest level of government available (Consolidated general government, consolidated central government or budgetary central government) and are available for about 100 countries on a regular basis. In some cases (for example, India and Pakistan), data may reflect the general government sector as per national norm. That is, budgetary central government combined with state government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2001 forward&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this indicator is based on national accounts data and total government expenditures, it does not allow for disaggregation by demographic characteristics or geographic location. However, where countries report expenditure data for the consolidated general government and it subsectors, disaggregation by level of government is possible.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
