Functions are classified using a three-level scheme, consistent with the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC), Rev.4. In particular, the scheme includes: </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>10 first-level, or two digit, categories, referred to as divisions, including Economic Affairs (04) and Environmental Protection (05); </li>\n  <li>within each division, 2 or more 3-digit three-digit categories, referred to as groups, such as Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting (042) and Protection of Biodiversity and Landscapes (054); and </li>\n  <li>within each group, one or more four-digit categories, referred to as classes, such as Agriculture (0421), Forestry (0422) and Fishing and hunting (0423), as well as related Research and Development (0482), covering the administration and operation of government agencies engaged in applied research and experimental development related to the sector, including that undertaken by nongovernment bodies, such as research institutes and universities funded by government grants and subsidies.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) questionnaire on Government Finance Statistics (GFS) collects annual data on the first two levels (divisions and groups). The FAO questionnaire aims at collecting information on classes, as well as a breakdown of the related expenditure in recurrent and capital expenditures. The three classification levels and the contents of each class are described in the GFSM 2014, accessible at https://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/gfsm/. </p>\n<p>FAOSTAT geographic classification is used to aggregate indicators across country groups (<a href=\"http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#definitions\">http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#definitions</a>).</p>"}
