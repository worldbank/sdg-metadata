	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data on government expenditures is collected from countries through an annual questionnaire administered by FAO. These data are not affected by sampling error, given that countries typically compile the questionnaires administered by FAO on the basis of their financial and accounting systems, using administrative information on government expenditures based on the availability and comprehensiveness of source data. For some countries that do not report directly data to FAO, information is obtained either from the IMF GFS database; however in this cases information is not disaggregated of the basis of COFOG 042; or from official national governmental websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on agriculture value-added and GDP are retrieved from the system of national accounts. THs is normally an analytical framework that includes national data from a mix of survey, census and administrative (e.g. tax) sources. This data is sourced from the UN Statistics Division, which provides national accounts estimates for 220 countries and territories.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
