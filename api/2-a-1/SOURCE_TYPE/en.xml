	<message>The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 2-a-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data on government expenditures is collected from countries through an annual questionnaire administered by FAO. These data are not affected by sampling error, given that countries typically compile the questionnaires administered by FAO on the basis of their financial and accounting systems, using administrative information on government expenditures based on the availability and comprehensiveness of source data. For some countries that do not report directly data to FAO, key expenditure aggregates needed to calculate Indicator 2.a.1 are obtained either from the IMF GFS database, from other regional organizations, or from official national governmental websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on agriculture value-added and GDP are retrieved from the UN Statistics Division, which provides national accounts estimates for 220 countries and territories.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
