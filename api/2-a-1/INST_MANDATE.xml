			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Article I of the FAO Constitution requires the Organization to &amp;quot;collect, analyse, interpret and disseminate information relating to nutrition, food and agriculture.&amp;quot; (http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5584e/x5584e00.htm). Member countries reaffirmed this mandate in 2000. Within the FAO&amp;apos;s statistical program of work, member countries endorsed the development of an investment statistics domain, including ongoing work on government expenditure on agriculture, during meetings of three statutory bodies: the Asia and Pacific Commission on Agricultural Statistics (APCAS) held in Vietnam in February 2014; the African Commission on Agricultural Statistics (AFCAS) held in Morocco in December 2013; and the IICA working group on agricultural and livestock statistics for Latin America and the Caribbean, held in Trinidad and Tobago in June 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
