	<message>The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 6-2-1b, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data sources included in the JMP database are: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Censuses, which in principle collect basic data from all people living within a country and led by national statistical offices. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Household surveys, which collect data from a subset of households. These may target national, rural, or urban populations, or more limited project or sub-national areas. An appropriate sample design is necessary for survey results to be representative, and surveys are often led by or reviewed and approved by national statistical organizations. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other datasets may be available such as compilations by international or regional initiatives (e.g. Eurostat), studies conducted by research institutes, or technical advice received during country consultations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access to water, sanitation and hygiene are considered core socio-economic and health indicators, and key determinants of child survival, maternal, and children&amp;#x2019;s health, family wellbeing, and economic productivity. Drinking water, sanitation and hygiene facilities are also used in constructing wealth quintiles used by many integrated household surveys to analyse inequalities between rich and poor. Access to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene are therefore core indicators for many household surveys and censuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JMP uses data on the observation of handwashing facilities with water and soap, typically available in Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) and Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), as well as other household surveys. Any available surveys recording observation of handwashing facilities are included in the JMP database and JMP regression rules are applied to estimate the proportion of the population with a handwashing facility, as well as the proportion with a handwashing facility with water and soap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Household surveys increasingly include a section on hygiene practices where the surveyor visits the handwashing facility and observes if water and soap are present. Observation of handwashing materials by surveyors represents a more reliable proxy for handwashing behaviour than asking individuals whether they wash their hands. The small number of cases where households refuse to give enumerators permission to observe their facilities are excluded from JMP estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct observation of handwashing facilities has been included as a standard module in MICS and DHS since 2009. Following the standardization of hygiene questions in international surveys, data on handwashing facilities are available for a growing number of low- and middle-income countries. This type of information is not available from most high-income countries, where access to basic handwashing facilities is assumed to be nearly universal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some datasets reviewed by the JMP are not representative of national, rural or urban populations, or may be representative of only a subset of these populations. The JMP enters datasets into the global database when they represent at least 20% of the national, urban or rural populations. However, datasets representing less than 80% of the relevant population, or which are considered unreliable or inconsistent with other datasets covering similar populations, are not used in the production of estimates (see section 2.6, Data Acceptance in JMP Methodology: 2017 update and SDG baselines). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The population data used by the JMP, including the proportion of the population living in urban and rural areas, are those routinely updated by the UN Population Division (World Population Prospects: &lt;a href=&quot;https://population.un.org/wpp/&quot;&gt;https://population.un.org/wpp/&lt;/a&gt;; World Urbanization Projects: &lt;a href=&quot;https://population.un.org/wup&quot;&gt;https://population.un.org/wup&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
