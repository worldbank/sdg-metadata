	<message>The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 6-2-1b, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Every two years the JMP updates its global databases to incorporate the latest available national data for the global SDG indicators. National authorities are consulted on the estimates generated from national data sources through a country consultation process facilitated by WHO and UNICEF country offices. The country consultation aims to engage national statistical offices and other relevant national stakeholders to review the draft estimates and provide technical feedback to the JMP team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the consultation is not to compare JMP and national estimates of WASH coverage but rather to review the completeness or correctness of the datasets in the JMP country file and to verify the interpretation of national data in the JMP estimates. The JMP provides detailed guidance to facilitate country consultation on the estimates contained in JMP country files. The consultation focusses on three main questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is the country file missing any relevant national sources of data that would allow for better estimates?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are the data sources listed considered reliable and suitable for use as official national statistics?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is the JMP interpretation and classification of the data extracted from national sources accurate and appropriate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JMP estimates are circulated for a 2 month period of consultation with national authorities starting in the fourth quarter of the year prior to publication (https://washdata.org/how-we-work/jmp-country-consultation).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
