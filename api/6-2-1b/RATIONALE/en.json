Improved hygiene is one of the most important measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases including diarrhoeal diseases and acute respiratory infections which remain leading global causes of disease. Most infectious diseases are caused by bacteria or viruses which are transmitted either through the air, via surfaces or food, or via human faeces. Because people frequently touch their face, food, and surfaces, handwashing reduces the spread of these bacteria and viruses and is widely regarded as a top priority for improving global health outcomes. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Monitoring handwashing behaviour is difficult, but household surveys increasingly include a module that involves direct observation of facilities and presence of water and soap that has been shown to be a reasonable proxy for actual handwashing practices. International consultations among WASH sector professionals identified the presence of a handwashing facility with soap and water available within the dwelling, yard or plot as a priority indicator for national and global monitoring of hygiene under SDG 6.2. The SDG indicator 6.2.1.b is therefore designed to address both access to facilities and the availability of soap and water for handwashing at the household level.</p>"}
