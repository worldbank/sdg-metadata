	<data>&lt;p&gt;The presence of a handwashing facility with soap and water available does not guarantee that household members consistently wash hands at key times. But direct observation of handwashing is challenging, and people tend to behave differently when being observed. The presence of a handwashing facility with soap and water available has been shown to be a reasonable proxy for handwashing. Enumerators ask households to show them where members of the household most often wash their hands and record the type of facility and whether soap and water are present at the time of the survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2016 household surveys have refined the questions asked about handwashing facilities to include separate response categories for different types of handwashing facilities, including both fixed devices like sinks and taps, and mobile devices like jugs and portable basins. These surveys have shown that mobile devices are widely used in low-income countries. Older surveys that don&amp;#x2019;t include responses for mobile devices may therefore underestimate the population with access to handwashing facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Households surveys in high-income countries rarely include questions about handwashing facilities, and as such, have very low data coverage. Some countries have data on the proportion of households with piped water supplies, hot water, showers or bathrooms but further work is required to determine how many of these also have basic hygiene services.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
