	<data>&lt;p&gt;Breed-related information remains far from complete. Across the world, when excluding extinct breeds, 61 percent of local breeds are classified as of unknown status because of missing population data or lack of recent updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, data collection should be possible in all countries. Updating of population size data at least each 10 years is needed for the definition of the risk classes.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
