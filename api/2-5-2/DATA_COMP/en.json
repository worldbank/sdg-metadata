{"status":"success","message":"The DATA_COMP field for indicator 2-5-2, translated into en","data":"<p>The indicator is based on the data contained in FAO&#x2019;s Global Databank for Animal Genetic Resources DAD-IS (http://dad.fao.org/). Risk classes are defined based on population sizes of breeds reported to DAD-IS. The risk class is considered to be &#x201C;unknown&#x201D; if (i) no population sizes are reported or (ii) the most recent population size reported refers to a year more than 10- years before the year of calculation (10 year cut off point). </p>\n<p> Species are assigned to two groups. The first group comprises species that have high reproductive capacity, such as pigs, rabbits, guinea pigs and avian species, and the second comprises species that</p>\n<p>have low reproductive capacity, i.e. those belonging to the taxonomical families Bovidae,</p>\n<p>Equidae, Camelidae and Cervidae.</p>\n<p>The risk status categories are defined as follows (see also FAO. 2013.
