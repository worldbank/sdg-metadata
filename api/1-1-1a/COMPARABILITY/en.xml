&lt;p&gt;National poverty is a different concept than global poverty. National poverty rate is defined at country-specific poverty lines in local currencies, which are different in real terms across countries and different from the $2.15-a-day international poverty line. Thus, national poverty rates cannot be compared across countries or with the $2.15-a-day poverty rate.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
