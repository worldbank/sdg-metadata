	<data>&lt;p&gt;In many low-income countries, the Poverty and Equity Global Practice of the World Bank is cooperating with the National Statistical Offices and supporting their efforts of conducting household surveys and measuring poverty. Data are obtained through these partnerships. This concerns most countries in East Asia &amp;amp; Pacific, the Middle East &amp;amp; North Africa, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Latin America and the Caribbean, most of the data are obtained from and harmonized by the CEDLAS&amp;#x2019;s Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean (SEDLAC), which is a partnership between the Center for Distributive, Labor and Social Studies (CEDLAS) at the National University of La Plata in Argentina and the World Bank&amp;#x2019;s Poverty and Equity Global Practice for Latin America and the Caribbean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most high-income countries data are obtained through the Luxembourg Income Study or EU-SILC.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
