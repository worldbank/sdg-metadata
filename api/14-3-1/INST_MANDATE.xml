			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;IOC-UNESCO is the custodian agency for the SDG indicator 14.3.1. The purpose of the Commission is to promote international cooperation and to coordinate programmes in research, services and capacity-building, in order to learn more about the nature and resources of the ocean and coastal areas and to apply that knowledge for the improvement of management, sustainable development, the protection of the marine environment, and the decision-making processes of its Member States. In addition, IOC is recognized through the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as a competent international organization in the fields of Marine Scientific Research (Part XIII) and Transfer of Marine Technology (Part XIV). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to its Statutes, the Commission may act also as a joint specialized mechanism of the organizations of the United Nations system that have agreed to use the Commission for discharging certain of their responsibilities in the fields of marine sciences and ocean services, and have agreed accordingly to sustain the work of the Commission. IOC is further one of the organizations supporting the Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network (GOA-ON) (&lt;a href=&quot;http://goa-on.org&quot;&gt;http://goa-on.org&lt;/a&gt;). The Commission hosts one part of the distributed GOA-ON Secretariat, fostering science collaboration and capacity building in ocean acidification observations. GOA-ON actively encourages its members to collect and report metadata and data relevant for the SDG indicator 14.3.1.&lt;/p&gt;
