			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;As this indicator only considers data submitted by Member States, there are no discrepancies between estimates and submitted data sets. In the past, differences between countries in the measurement of pH and other ocean acidification data were mainly attributable to technical difficulties and the lack of comprehensive guidelines for the best practice of measurements. The present Methodology and the guidelines contained within provide detailed instructions on the measurement, collection, treatment and quality control of data in a way that will enable countries to avoid future discrepancies. &lt;/p&gt;
