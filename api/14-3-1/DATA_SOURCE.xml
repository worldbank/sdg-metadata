			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The general IOC data collection process is described in Document IOC-XXIX/2Annex 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novelty of assessing ocean acidification at the global level, as for this indicator 14.3.1, requires the IOC secretariat to collect the data via a range of different pathways. This will include direct requests to National Statistical Offices (NSOs), annual requests to the IOC national focal points, and NODCs and associated data agencies in the member states, as well as international data centres and individual data providers.&lt;/p&gt;
