Data provided by experts, who are not representatives of NODCs or IOC Member States, are sent for national validation to the relevant official counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further IOC receives verified information by the identified representatives of its Member States directly, which entails the validation necessary to be published for the SDG indicator 14.3.1 assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
