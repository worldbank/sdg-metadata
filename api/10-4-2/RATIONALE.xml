			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Developed by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://commitmentoequity.org/&quot;&gt;Commitment to Equity Institute&lt;/a&gt; (CEQ) at Tulane University, the &lt;u&gt;Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy&lt;/u&gt; indicator demonstrates in an accounting framework the total amount by which current income inequality is reduced or increased by the current execution of fiscal policy (including direct and indirect taxes; social insurance and old-age pension contributions; direct cash or near-cash transfers; and subsidies). For example, if the Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy is positive, that indicates that the net effect of Fiscal Policy is to reduce the Gini index from what it otherwise would be without Fiscal Policy (in an accounting sense, not as an economic counterfactual). The indicator allows policy makers and the broader stakeholder and advocacy communities to systematically track progress at the country level in the contribution of fiscal policy to more equitable societies. &lt;/p&gt;
