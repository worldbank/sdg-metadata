{"status":"success","message":"The COVERAGE field for indicator 10-4-2, translated into en","data":"<p>As of February 2021, the Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicator is available from the Commitment to Equity Institute and the World Bank and <em>for at least one year</em> in 78 countries across the following regions: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>East Asia and the Pacific: 11</li>\n  <li>Europe and Central Asia: 38</li>\n  <li>Latin America and the Caribbean: 10</li>\n  <li>Middle East and North Africa: 3</li>\n  <li>North America: 2</li>\n  <li>East Asia Pacific: 11</li>\n  <li>Sub-Saharan Africa: 14</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The indicator is available for 34 of the 37 OECD member countries for Pre-fiscal and Disposable Income only. Data are available annually (with the exception of countries whose income survey is fielded every two or three years) through the OECD Income Distribution Database.</p>\n<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>\n<p>The Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicator is currently <em>for the most part</em> available for single country/year pairs only. The main limitation to producing more frequent time series is the availability of more frequent household surveys. However, that is also a limitation faced by other SDG indicators. </p>\n<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>\n<p>The Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicator can be shown separately for as many different subgroups as are represented in the survey or micro-data from which it is drawn: income subgroups; by gender, age group, ethnic grouping; geographic location; disability status, household size; household dependency ratios, and so on. These are frequently reported in the main CEQ studies which the SDG indicators are drawn from but not reported within the SG database itself.</p>"}
