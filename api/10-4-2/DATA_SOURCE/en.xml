	<message>The DATA_SOURCE field for indicator 10-4-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the data providers are national-level statistical agencies for the micro-data sets and national-level fiscal agencies and bodies for budgetary and administrative data. Most OECD countries also calculate their own pre- and post-fiscal Ginis. That is, they directly calculate the 10.4.2 indicator. These are collated by the OECD and will be sent directly to the World Bank as custodians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where a country produces its own 10.4.2 indicator it will take precedence over estimates produced by other institutions, subject to meeting the reporting requirements below. For all other countries, estimates and indicators produced by the WBG and/or the Commitment to Equity Institute will be considered.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
