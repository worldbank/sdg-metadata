	<data>&lt;p&gt;The Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicator is &lt;em&gt;constructed&lt;/em&gt; from a range of data sources using a standardized methodology as outlined in Lustig, 2018. To construct this indicator requires a nationally representative micro-data set (a Household Budget Survey, for example, or an Income and Expenditure Survey) and fiscal or budgetary or administrative data on revenue collections, social expenditures, and expenditures on consumption subsidies. The data sources employed at the country level are detailed in the country-specific footnotes. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
