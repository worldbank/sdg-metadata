{"status":"success","message":"The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 10-4-2, translated into en","data":"<p>Nationally representative micro-data sets are often collected and hosted by the national statistics agency. However, access to such data sets is frequently given to a different part of the administration (the Ministry of Finance, for example, or the Ministry of Development and Planning). Fiscal or budgetary or administrative data is occasionally available in unabridged summaries with enough detail at the program or policy level for the estimation of the indicator. More often, however, budgetary and administrative data is kept by the agency executing the program (so, for example, the Ministry of Education will keep data on its own fiscal-year expenditures). These datasets are then used to construct the <u>Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy</u> indicator.</p>"}
