Technical and economic institutions provide their relevant data, sometimes through the National Statistical Office (NSO), particularly for the economic data.</p>\n<p>Although data collection and its modality remains ultimately a responsibility of each country, FAO is working to promote a more regular involvement of NSOs, in order to ensure strongest consistency and robustness of the data provided.</p>\n<p>The list of National Focal Points for those countries involved through the GEMI project is in annex. </p><h1>Data compilers</h1>\n<p>FAO (through AQUASTAT), on behalf of UN-Water. The monitoring of this indicator will be integrated into the GEMI initiative, which together with JMP and GLAAS, under the UN-Water umbrella, will provide a coherent framework for global monitoring of SDG 6.</p><h2>Rationale:</h2>\n<p>The rationale behind this indicator consists in providing information on the efficiency of the economic and social usage of water resources, i.e. value added generated by the use of water in the main sectors of the economy, and distribution network losses.</p>\n<p>The distribution efficiency of water systems is implicit within the calculations and could be made explicit if needed and where data are available.</p>\n<p>This indicator addresses specifically the target component &#x201C;substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors&#x201D;, by measuring the output per unit of water from productive uses of water as well as losses in municipal water use. It does not aim at giving an exhaustive picture of the water utilization in a country. Other indicators, specifically those for Targets 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 5.4, 5.a, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5 will complement the information provided by this indicator. In particular, the indicator needs to be combined with the water stress indicator 6.4.2 to provide adequate follow-up of the target 6.4.</p>\n<p>Together, the three sectoral efficiencies provide a measure of overall water efficiency in a country. The indicator provides incentives to improve water use efficiency through all sectors, highlighting those sectors where water use efficiency is lagging behind.</p>\n<p>The interpretation of the indicator would be enhanced by the utilization of supplementary indicators to be used at country level. Particularly important in this sense would be the indicator on efficiency of water for energy and the indicator on the efficiency of the municipality distribution networks.</p><h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n<p>The corrective coefficient Cr for the agricultural sector is needed in order to focus the indicator on the irrigated production. This is done for two main reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>To ensure that only runoff water and groundwater (so-called blue water) are considered in computing the indicator;</li>\n  <li>To eliminate a potential bias of the indicators, which otherwise would tend to decrease if rainfed cropland is converted to irrigated.</li>\n</ul><h1>Methodology</h1>\n<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n<p>Water use efficiency is computed as the sum of the three sectors listed above, weighted according to the proportion of water used by each sector over the total use.

That is due to the fact that, for the agricultural sector, only the value produced under irrigation has to be counted in calculating the indicator.

No pretende ofrecer una imagen exhaustiva de la utilización del agua en un país. Otros indicadores, concretamente los correspondientes a los Objetivos 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 5.4, 5.a, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5 complementarán la información proporcionada por este indicador. En particular, el indicador debe combinarse con el indicador de estrés hídrico 6.4.2 para proporcionar un seguimiento adecuado de la meta 6.4.</p>\n<p>En conjunto, las tres eficiencias sectoriales proporcionan una medida de la eficiencia global del agua en un país. El indicador proporciona incentivos para mejorar la eficiencia en el uso del agua a través de todos los sectores, destacando aquellos sectores en los que la eficiencia en el uso del agua se está quedando atrás.</p>\n<p>La interpretación del indicador se vería reforzada por la utilización de indicadores complementarios que se utilizarían a nivel de país. En este sentido, serían especialmente importantes el indicador sobre la eficiencia del agua para la energía y el indicador sobre la eficiencia de las redes de distribución de los municipios.</p><h2>Comentarios y limitaciones:</h2>\n<p>El coeficiente corrector Cr para el sector agrícola es necesario para centrar el indicador en la producción de regadío. Esto se hace por dos razones principales:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Para garantizar que sólo se consideran las aguas de escorrentía y las aguas subterráneas (las llamadas aguas azules) en el cálculo del indicador;</li>\n  <li>Para eliminar un posible sesgo de los indicadores, que de otro modo tenderían a disminuir si las tierras de cultivo de secano se convierten en regadío.</li>\n</ul><h1>Metodología</h1>\n<h2>Método del cálculo:</h2>\n<p>La eficiencia en el uso del agua se calcula como la suma de los tres sectores enumerados anteriormente, ponderada de acuerdo con la proporción de agua utilizada por cada sector sobre el uso total.

En particulier, l’indicateur doit être combiné à l’indicateur de stress hydrique 6.4.2 pour assurer un suivi adéquat de l’objectif 6.4. </p>\n<p> Ensemble, les trois gains d’efficacité sectoriels fournissent une mesure de l’efficacité globale de l’eau dans un pays. L’indicateur incite à améliorer l’efficacité de l’utilisation de l’eau dans tous les secteurs, en mettant en évidence les secteurs où l’efficacité de l’utilisation de l’eau est à la traîne. </p>\n<p> L’interprétation de l’indicateur serait renforcée par l’utilisation d’indicateurs supplémentaires à utiliser au niveau des pays. L’indicateur sur l’efficacité de l’eau pour l’énergie et l’indicateur sur l’efficacité des réseaux de distribution municipaux seraient particulièrement importants en ce sens. </p><h2>Commentaires et limitations:</h2>\n<p> Le coefficient correctif Cr pour le secteur agricole est nécessaire pour concentrer l’indicateur sur la production irriguée. Ceci est fait pour deux raisons principales:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Veiller à ce que seules l’eau de ruissellement et les eaux souterraines (ce qu’on appelle l’eau bleue) soient prises en compte dans l’calcul de l’indicateur; </li>\n  <li> Éliminer un biais potentiel des indicateurs, qui autrement tendrait à diminuer si les terres cultivées plumentées étaient converties en terres irriguées. </li>\n</ul><h1> Méthodologie</h1>\n<h2> Méthode de calcul:</h2>\n<p> L’efficacité de l’utilisation de l’eau est calculée comme la somme des trois secteurs énumérés ci-dessus, pondérée en fonction de la proportion d’eau utilisée par chaque secteur par rapport à l’utilisation totale.

Затем результаты анализа доводятся до сведения страны с тем, чтобы обеспечить согласованность и гармонизацию методов, определений и результатов. </p>\n<p> ФАО подготовила пошаговый методологический документ, призванный предоставить техническое руководство для страновых групп. Кроме того, готовится средство дистанционного обучения в виде онлайн-курса, который будет готов в начале 2018 года. Наконец, готовится проект общего руководства.</p><h1> Ссылки </h1>\n<ul>\n  <li> Главная страница AQUASTAT: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/main/index.stm\"> http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/main/index.stm </a> </li>\n  <li> Глоссарий AQUASTAT: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/glossary/search.html\"> http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/glossary/search.html </a> </li>\n  <li> AQUASTAT Основная база данных по странам: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/query/index.html?lang=en\"> http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/query/index.html?lang=en </a> </li>\n  <li> AQUASTAT Водопользование: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/water_use/index.stm\"> http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/water_use/index.stm </a> </li>\n  <li> AQUASTAT Водные ресурсы: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/water_res/index.stm\"> http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/water_res/index.stm </a> </li>\n  <li> Публикации AQUASTAT, касающиеся концепций, методологий, определений, терминологии, метаданных и т. д .: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/catalogues/index.stm\"> http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/catalogues/index.stm </a> </li>\n  <li> Контроль качества AQUASTAT: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/index.stm#main\"> http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/index.stm#main </a> </li>\n  <li> Рекомендации AQUASTAT: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/aq-5yr-guide_eng.pdf\"> http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/aq-5yr-guide_eng.pdf </a> </li>\n  <li> Производственная база данных FAOSTAT: <a href=\"http://faostat3.fao.org/download/Q/*/E\"> http://faostat3.fao.org/download/Q/*/E </a> </li>\n  <li> Вопросник СОООН / ЮНЕП по статистике окружающей среды &#x2013; Сектор водных ресурсов: <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/questionnaire.htm\"> http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/questionnaire.htm </a> </li>\n  <li> <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/qindicators.htm\"> http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/qindicators.htm </a> <u> </u> </li>\n  <li> Базовые принципы развития статистики окружающей среды (ПРСОС 2013 год) (Глава 3): <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/FDES/FDES-2015-supporting-tools/FDES.pdf\"> http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/FDES/FDES-2015-supporting-tools/FDES.pdf [ 2186] </li>\n  <li> Международные рекомендации по статистике водных ресурсов (МРСВР) (2012 год): <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/irws/\"> http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/irws/ </a> </li>\n  <li> Вопросник ОЭСР / Евростата по статистике окружающей среды &#x2013; Сектор водных ресурсов: <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/environment/water\"> http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/environment/water </a> </li>\n  <li> Файлы данных национальных счетов ОЭСР: <a href=\"http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/data/oecd-national-accounts-statistics_na-data-en\"> http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/data/oecd-national-accounts-statistics_na-data-en </a> </li>\n  <li> СПЭУ-Водные ресурсы: <a href=\"https://seea.un.org/sites/seea.un.org/files/seeawaterwebversion_final_en.pdf\"> https://seea.un.org/sites/seea.un.org/files/seeawaterwebversion_final_en.pdf </a> </li>\n  <li> Центральная основа СПЭУ: <a href=\"https://seea.un.org/sites/seea.un.org/files/seea_cf_final_en.pdf\"> https://seea.un.org/sites/seea.un.org/files/seea_cf_final_en.pdf </a> </li>\n  <li> База данных основных агрегатов национальных счетов СОООН: <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/selbasicFast.asp\"> http://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/selbasicFast.asp </a> </li>\n  <li> Банк данных Всемирного банка (Мировые экономические показатели) <a href=\"http://databank.worldbank.org/data/home.aspx\"> http://databank.worldbank.org/data/home.aspx </a> </li>\n  <li> МСОК ред. 4: <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl=27\"> https://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl=27 </a> </li>\n</ul>"}}
