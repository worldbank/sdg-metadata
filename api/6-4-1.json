Official counterparts at country level are the national statistics offices and/or the line Ministry for water resources and irrigation. More specifically, FAO requests countries to nominate a National Correspondent to act as the focal point for the data collection and communication. Data are mainly published within national statistical yearbooks, national water resources and irrigation master plans, and other reports (such as those from projects, international surveys or results and publications from national and international research centres).</p><p>Data collection is done through FAO&apos;s global information system on water and agriculture (AQUASTAT) </p>\n<p>and the AQUASTAT questionnaire on water and agriculture. The data collection process relies on a network of National Correspondents, officially nominated by their respective countries, in charge of the provision of official national data to AQUASTAT. As of August 2020, 150 countries have nominated national correspondents, as well as alternate correspondents from different agencies. Countries submit data through the annual AQUASTAT questionnaire on water and agriculture, which contains- among others - the information required for the calculation of SDG indicator 6.4.1. Regarding the economic indicators (GVA), FAO uses UNSD data base and aggregates it following the revision 4 ISIC-4 is used as the standard for the definition of the economic sectors.</p><p>Data are collected every year through the AQUASTAT network of National Correspondents. FAO has dispatched the questionnaires to the National Correspondents between April and July 2020.</p><p>Data are released every year, usually in February following the UNSD collection schedule. </p><p>Data come from governmental sources. Data providers are different depending on the country. In many cases data collection at country level is coordinated by the National Statistics Office (NSO). Data not generated by a country is displayed with an appropriate qualifier. t</p><p>Calculation rules are predefined and use data referring to the same year to generate aggregate values. </p><p>FAO has, as part of its mandate, the function of &#x201C;collect, analyse, interpret and disseminate information relating to nutrition, food and agriculture&#x201D;. (FAO Constitution, Article 1)</p><p>The rationale behind this indicator consists in providing information on the efficiency of the economic and social usage of water resources, i.e. value added generated by the use of water in the main sectors of the economy, and distribution network losses.</p>\n<p>The distribution efficiency of water systems is implicit within the calculations and could be made explicit if needed and where data are available.</p>\n<p>This indicator addresses specifically the target component &#x201C;substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors&#x201D;, by measuring the output per unit of water from productive uses of water as well as losses in municipal water use. It does not aim at giving an exhaustive picture of the water utilization in a country. Other indicators, specifically those for Targets 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 5.4, 5.a, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5 will complement the information provided by this indicator. In particular, the indicator needs to be combined with the water stress indicator 6.4.2 to provide adequate follow-up of the target 6.4.</p>\n<p>Together, the three sectoral efficiencies provide a measure of overall water efficiency in a country. The indicator provides incentives to improve water use efficiency through all sectors, highlighting those sectors where water use efficiency is lagging behind.</p>\n<p>The interpretation of the indicator would be enhanced by the utilization of supplementary indicators to be used at country level. Particularly important in this sense would be the indicator on efficiency of water for energy and the indicator on the efficiency of the municipality distribution networks.</p><p>The corrective coefficient Cr for the agricultural sector is needed in order to focus the indicator on the irrigated production. This is done for two main reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>To ensure that only runoff water and groundwater (so-called blue water) are considered in computing the indicator;</li>\n  <li>To eliminate a potential bias of the indicators, which otherwise would tend to decrease if rainfed cropland is converted to irrigated.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Computation Method:</strong></p>\n<p>Water use efficiency is computed as the sum of the three sectors listed above, weighted according to the proportion of water used by each sector over the total use.

That is due to the fact that, for the agricultural sector, only the value produced under irrigation has to be counted in calculating the indicator. Hence, the sum of the value added of the various sectors used in these formulas is not equivalent to the total GDP of the country.</p><p>Data validation is done in a number of steps. </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>the AQUASTAT questionnaire embeds automatic validation rules to allow National Correspondents to identify any data consistency errors while compiling the data. </li>\n  <li> Once the questionnaire is submitted, FAO thoroughly reviews the information reported, using the following tools:<ul>\n      <li>Manual cross-variable check. This includes cross-comparison with similar countries as well as historic data for the countries. </li>\n      <li>Time-series coherency by running an R-script to compare reported data with those corresponding to previous years</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Verification of the metadata, in particular the source of the proposed data. The critical analysis of the compiled data gives preference to national sources and expert knowledge.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>After this verification, exchanges between the National Correspondents and FAO takes place to correct and confirm the collected data. </li>\n  <li>The last validation step is an automated validation routine included in the Statistical Working System (SWS), which uses almost 200 validation rules. </li>\n</ul><p>Since national level data is frequently tailored to be useful at national level and not for international comparisons, data may be manipulated in order to maximize international comparability. Adjusted data is displayed with an appropriate qualifier. Data is rounded according to a specific methodology <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/aquastat/en/databases/maindatabase/metadata/\">http://www.fao.org/aquastat/en/databases/maindatabase/metadata/</a></p>\n<p>Additionally, the Statistical Working System (SWS) has the correspondence among different international codes (FAOSTAT, UNSDM49, ISO2, ISO3) for geographic areas and is used to convert area codes in the external sources to UNSDM49 codes which is the standard used in the SWS.</p><p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>\n<p>If scattered data (over time) are available, linear interpolation method takes place if there are at least two non-missing values in the time series. If not, the only possible way to impute it is through the carry-forward. Imputed data is displayed with an appropriate qualifier. </p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>\n<p>If country data are missing, the value of the indicator will be considered in the average of the others in the same region. Imputed data is displayed with an appropriate qualifier. </p><p>The aggregation for global and regional estimations is done by summing up the values of the various parameters constituting the elements of the formula, i.e. value added by sector and water use by sector. The aggregated indicator is then calculated by applying the formula with those aggregated data, as if it were a single country.</p>\n<p>An Excel sheet with the calculations exists, and can be shared with the IAEG if required.</p><ul>\n  <li>A set of tools is available to countries for the compilation of the indicator. Among them, a step-by-step methodological guide, an interpretation paper, and an e-learning course. All the tools are available on the FAO web pages, at: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators/641/en/\">http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators/641/en/</a></li>\n  <li>During 2020 and 2021 FAO has organized four virtual trainings for Asia, Latin-America and the Caribbean and Africa on SDG 6.4. </li>\n  <li>FAO&#x2019;s AQUASTAT team provides continued guidance to the countries thought the National Correspondents during the data collection time to ensure data is duly and timely compiled.</li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li>The annual AQUASTAT questionnaire, used for collecting information on SDG indicator 6.4.1 has been endorsed by FAO&#x2019;s Office of the Chief Statistician (OCS).</li>\n  <li>During the SDG reporting process, the OCS provides overall guidance, including metadata reporting, based on the Metadata Dissemination Standard approved by the FAO IDWG-Statistics Technical Task Force.</li>\n  <li>After revision and validation, SDG indicators are submitted to the OCS which also ensures the quality of the data and results.</li>\n</ul><p>FAO is responsible for the quality of the internal statistical processes used to compile the published datasets. The FAO Statistics Quality Assurance Framework (SQAF), available at: http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3664e/i3664e.pdf, provides the necessary principles, guidelines and tools to carry out quality assessments. FAO is performing an internal bi-annual survey (FAO Quality Assessment and Planning Survey) designed to gather information on all of FAO&#x2019;s statistical activities, notably to assess the extent to which quality standards are being implemented with a view to increasing compliance with the quality dimensions of SQAF, documenting best practices and prepare quality improvement plans, where necessary. Domain-specific quality assurance activities are carried out systematically (e.g. quality reviews, self-assessments, compliance monitoring).</p><p>Overall evaluation of data quality is based on standard quality criteria and follows FAO&#x2019;s SQAF. It also includes:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A qualitative and quantitative manual cross-variable check after data is received. This consists of the verification that all the numbers are consistent based on the internal validation rules embedded in the questionnaire. Any issues identified are flagged and listed to be followed-up with the countries. </li>\n  <li>Time-series coherency check done by running an R-script to compare reported data with those corresponding to previous years. Based on this, a scattered diagram is also made by variable and country to allow for a visual verification of historical data. The critical analysis of the compiled data gives preference to national sources and expert knowledge, unless these greatly diverge from historic data or in the case of drastic changes in methodologies used by countries. </li>\n  <li>Verification of the metadata, in particular the source of the proposed data.

El seguimiento de este indicador se integrará en la iniciativa GEMI, que junto con JMP y GLAAS, bajo el paraguas de ONU-Agua, proporcionará un marco coherente para el seguimiento mundial del ODS 6.</p><h2>Justificación:</h2>\n<p>El fundamento de este indicador consiste en proporcionar información sobre la eficiencia del uso económico y social de los recursos hídricos, es decir, el valor agregado generado por el uso del agua en los principales sectores de la economía y las pérdidas de la red de distribución.</p>\n<p>La eficiencia de la distribución de los sistemas de agua está implícita en los cálculos y podría hacerse explícita si es necesario y si se dispone de datos.</p>\n<p>Este indicador aborda específicamente el componente objetivo &#x201C;de aumentar sustancialmente la eficiencia del uso del agua en todos los sectores&#x201D;, midiendo la producción por unidad de agua de los usos productivos del agua, así como las pérdidas en el uso municipal del agua. No pretende ofrecer una imagen exhaustiva de la utilización del agua en un país. Otros indicadores, concretamente los correspondientes a los Objetivos 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 5.4, 5.a, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5 complementarán la información proporcionada por este indicador. En particular, el indicador debe combinarse con el indicador de estrés hídrico 6.4.2 para proporcionar un seguimiento adecuado de la meta 6.4.</p>\n<p>En conjunto, las tres eficiencias sectoriales proporcionan una medida de la eficiencia global del agua en un país. El indicador proporciona incentivos para mejorar la eficiencia en el uso del agua a través de todos los sectores, destacando aquellos sectores en los que la eficiencia en el uso del agua se está quedando atrás.</p>\n<p>La interpretación del indicador se vería reforzada por la utilización de indicadores complementarios que se utilizarían a nivel de país. En este sentido, serían especialmente importantes el indicador sobre la eficiencia del agua para la energía y el indicador sobre la eficiencia de las redes de distribución de los municipios.</p><h2>Comentarios y limitaciones:</h2>\n<p>El coeficiente corrector Cr para el sector agrícola es necesario para centrar el indicador en la producción de regadío. Esto se hace por dos razones principales:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Para garantizar que sólo se consideran las aguas de escorrentía y las aguas subterráneas (las llamadas aguas azules) en el cálculo del indicador;</li>\n  <li>Para eliminar un posible sesgo de los indicadores, que de otro modo tenderían a disminuir si las tierras de cultivo de secano se convierten en regadío.</li>\n</ul><h1>Metodología</h1>\n<h2>Método del cálculo:</h2>\n<p>La eficiencia en el uso del agua se calcula como la suma de los tres sectores enumerados anteriormente, ponderada de acuerdo con la proporción de agua utilizada por cada sector sobre el uso total.

Esto se debe al hecho de que, para el sector agrícola, sólo hay que contar el valor producido bajo riego para calcular el indicador. Por lo tanto, la suma del valor agregado de los distintos sectores utilizada en estas fórmulas no es equivalente al PIB total del país.</p><h2>Tratamiento de valores faltantes:</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>A nivel de país:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Si se dispone de datos dispersos (a lo largo del tiempo), se desarrollará una metodología con respecto a la inter y la extrapolación.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>A nivel regional y mundial:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Si faltan datos de un país, el valor del indicador se considerará en la media de los demás de la misma región.</p><h2>Agregados regionales:</h2>\n<p>La agregación para las estimaciones globales y regionales se realiza sumando los valores de los distintos parámetros que constituyen los elementos de la fórmula, es decir, el valor agregado por sector y el uso del agua por sector.

Le suivi de cet indicateur sera intégré à l’initiative GEMI, qui, avec le JMP et le GLAAS, sous l’égide de l’ONU-Eau, fournira un cadre cohérent pour le suivi mondial de l’ODD 6. </p><h2> Justification:</h2>\n<p> La raison d’être de cet indicateur consiste à fournir des informations sur l’efficacité de l’utilisation économique et sociale des ressources en eau, c’est-à-dire la valeur ajoutée générée par l’utilisation de l’eau dans les principaux secteurs de l’économie, et les pertes des réseaux de distribution. </p>\n<p> L’efficacité de distribution des systèmes d’approvisionnement en eau est implicite dans les calculs et pourrait être explicite si nécessaire et lorsque des données sont disponibles. </p>\n<p> Cet indicateur traite plus particulièrement de la composante cible &#x201C;, ce qui augmente considérablement l’efficacité de l’utilisation de l’eau dans tous les secteurs&#x201D;, en mesurant la production par unité d’eau provenant des utilisations productives de l’eau ainsi que les pertes dans l’utilisation municipale de l’eau. Il ne vise pas à donner un tableau exhaustif de l’utilisation de l’eau dans un pays. D’autres indicateurs, en particulier ceux des cibles 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 5.4, 5.a, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5 compléteront les informations fournies par cet indicateur. En particulier, l’indicateur doit être combiné à l’indicateur de stress hydrique 6.4.2 pour assurer un suivi adéquat de l’objectif 6.4. </p>\n<p> Ensemble, les trois gains d’efficacité sectoriels fournissent une mesure de l’efficacité globale de l’eau dans un pays. L’indicateur incite à améliorer l’efficacité de l’utilisation de l’eau dans tous les secteurs, en mettant en évidence les secteurs où l’efficacité de l’utilisation de l’eau est à la traîne. </p>\n<p> L’interprétation de l’indicateur serait renforcée par l’utilisation d’indicateurs supplémentaires à utiliser au niveau des pays. L’indicateur sur l’efficacité de l’eau pour l’énergie et l’indicateur sur l’efficacité des réseaux de distribution municipaux seraient particulièrement importants en ce sens. </p><h2>Commentaires et limitations:</h2>\n<p> Le coefficient correctif Cr pour le secteur agricole est nécessaire pour concentrer l’indicateur sur la production irriguée. Ceci est fait pour deux raisons principales:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Veiller à ce que seules l’eau de ruissellement et les eaux souterraines (ce\nqu’on appelle l’eau bleue) soient prises en compte dans l’calcul de l’indicateur; </li>\n  <li> Éliminer un biais potentiel des indicateurs, qui autrement tendrait à diminuer\nsi les terres cultivées plumentées étaient converties en terres irriguées. </li> </ul><h1> Méthodologie</h1>\n<h2> Méthode de calcul:</h2>\n<p> L’efficacité de l’utilisation de l’eau est calculée comme la somme des trois secteurs énumérés ci-dessus, pondérée en fonction de la proportion d’eau utilisée par chaque secteur par rapport à l’utilisation totale.

Затем результаты анализа доводятся до сведения страны с тем, чтобы обеспечить согласованность и гармонизацию методов, определений и результатов. </p>\n<p> ФАО подготовила пошаговый методологический документ, призванный предоставить техническое руководство для страновых групп. Кроме того, готовится средство дистанционного обучения в виде онлайн-курса, который будет готов в начале 2018 года. Наконец, готовится проект общего руководства.</p><h1> Ссылки </h1>\n<ul>\n  <li> Главная страница AQUASTAT: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/main/index.stm\"> http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/main/index.stm </a> </li>\n  <li> Глоссарий AQUASTAT: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/glossary/search.html\"> http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/glossary/search.html </a> </li>\n  <li> AQUASTAT Основная база данных по странам: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/query/index.html?lang=en\"> http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/query/index.html?lang=en </a> </li>\n  <li> AQUASTAT Водопользование: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/water_use/index.stm\"> http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/water_use/index.stm </a> </li>\n  <li> AQUASTAT Водные ресурсы: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/water_res/index.stm\"> http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/water_res/index.stm </a> </li>\n  <li> Публикации AQUASTAT, касающиеся концепций, методологий, определений, терминологии, метаданных и т. д .: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/catalogues/index.stm\"> http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/catalogues/index.stm </a> </li>\n  <li> Контроль качества AQUASTAT: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/index.stm#main\"> http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/index.stm#main </a> </li>\n  <li> Рекомендации AQUASTAT: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/aq-5yr-guide_eng.pdf\"> http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/aq-5yr-guide_eng.pdf </a> </li>\n  <li> Производственная база данных FAOSTAT: <a href=\"http://faostat3.fao.org/download/Q/*/E\"> http://faostat3.fao.org/download/Q/*/E </a> </li>\n  <li> Вопросник СОООН / ЮНЕП по статистике окружающей среды &#x2013; Сектор водных ресурсов: <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/questionnaire.htm\"> http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/questionnaire.htm </a> </li>\n  <li> <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/qindicators.htm\"> http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/qindicators.htm </a> <u> </u> </li>\n  <li> Базовые принципы развития статистики окружающей среды (ПРСОС 2013 год) (Глава 3): <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/FDES/FDES-2015-supporting-tools/FDES.pdf\"> http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/FDES/FDES-2015-supporting-tools/FDES.pdf [ 2186] </li>\n  <li> Международные рекомендации по статистике водных ресурсов (МРСВР) (2012 год): <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/irws/\"> http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/irws/ </a> </li>\n  <li> Вопросник ОЭСР / Евростата по статистике окружающей среды &#x2013; Сектор водных ресурсов: <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/environment/water\"> http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/environment/water </a> </li>\n  <li> Файлы данных национальных счетов ОЭСР: <a href=\"http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/data/oecd-national-accounts-statistics_na-data-en\"> http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/data/oecd-national-accounts-statistics_na-data-en </a> </li>\n  <li> СПЭУ-Водные ресурсы: <a href=\"https://seea.un.org/sites/seea.un.org/files/seeawaterwebversion_final_en.pdf\"> https://seea.un.org/sites/seea.un.org/files/seeawaterwebversion_final_en.pdf </a> </li>\n  <li> Центральная основа СПЭУ: <a href=\"https://seea.un.org/sites/seea.un.org/files/seea_cf_final_en.pdf\"> https://seea.un.org/sites/seea.un.org/files/seea_cf_final_en.pdf </a> </li>\n  <li> База данных основных агрегатов национальных счетов СОООН: <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/selbasicFast.asp\"> http://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/selbasicFast.asp </a> </li>\n  <li> Банк данных Всемирного банка (Мировые экономические показатели) <a href=\"http://databank.worldbank.org/data/home.aspx\"> http://databank.worldbank.org/data/home.aspx </a> </li>\n  <li> МСОК ред. 4: <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl=27\"> https://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl=27 </a> </li>\n</ul>"}}
