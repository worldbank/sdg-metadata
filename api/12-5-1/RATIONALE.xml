			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Minimizing waste generation and maximizing the recycling of waste is central to the concept of circular economy. However, currently, the total amount of produced materials that are recycled are estimated to be low (based on academic literature). If countries better understand how waste are generated, collected and recycled, this will enable countries and other stakeholders to better determine how to deal with major waste streams, for example e-waste or plastic. &lt;/p&gt;
