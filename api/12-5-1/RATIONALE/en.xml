	<data>&lt;p&gt;Minimizing waste generation and maximizing the recycling of waste is central to the concept of circular economy. However, currently the total amount of produced materials that are recycled are estimated to be low (based on academic literature). If countries are to better understand how waste are generated, collected and recycled then this will put countries and other stakeholders in a better position to identify how to tackle the issues face for key waste streams (such as metals, e-waste or plastics). &lt;/p&gt;</data>
