UNSD carries out extensive data validation procedures that include built-in automated procedures, manual checks and cross-references to national sources of data. Communication is carried out with countries for clarification and validation of data. Only data that are considered accurate or those confirmed by countries during the validation process are included in UNSD&amp;#x2019;s environment statistics database and disseminated on UNSD&amp;#x2019;s website (&lt;a href=&quot;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/envstats/qindicators&quot;&gt;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/envstats/qindicators&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/envstats/country_files&quot;&gt;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/envstats/country_files&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Additionally, data from the Basel Convention reporting may also be sent to countries for their consideration for SDG reporting. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data for OECD and European Union countries are collected through the biennial OECD/Eurostat Joint Questionnaire on the State of the Environment that is consistent with the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire, so data are comparable.
