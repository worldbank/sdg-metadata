	<data>&lt;p&gt;The methods with agreed international standards have been developed, reviewed and published in various documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For countries with a high-quality vital registration system including information on cause of death, the vital registration that member states submit to the WHO Mortality Database were used, with adjustments where necessary, e.g. for under-reporting of deaths, unknown age and sex, and ill-defined causes of deaths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For countries without high-quality death registration data, cause of death estimates are calculated using other data, including household surveys with verbal autopsy, sample or sentinel registration systems, special studies &lt;/p&gt;
