	<data>&lt;p&gt;The global average density was estimated as the population weighted average of the national densities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the regional average density, data for the countries with missing values, if any in the last 5 years were first estimated with neighbouring comparable countries. Then the regional average was also computed as a weighted average by pooling these estimated values plus the available national densities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The population for estimating densities at regional and global level are based on the latest available estimates from the UN Population Division. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
