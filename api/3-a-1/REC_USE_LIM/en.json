{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 3-a-1, translated into en","data":"<p>Raw data collected through nationally representative population-based surveys in the countries are used to calculate comparable estimates for this indicator. Information from subnational surveys are not used. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In some countries, all tobacco use and tobacco smoking may be equivalent, but for many countries where other forms of tobacco are also being consumed, smoking rates will be lower than tobacco use rates to some degree. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The comparability, quality and frequency of household surveys affects the accuracy and quality of the estimates. Non-comparability of data can arise from the use of different survey instruments, sampling and analysis methods, and indicator definitions across Member States. Surveys may cover a variety of age ranges (not always 15+) and be repeated at irregular intervals. Surveys may include a variety of different tobacco products, or sometimes only one product such as cigarettes, based on the country&#x2019;s perception of which products are important to monitor. Unless both smoked and smokeless products are monitored simultaneously, tobacco use prevalence will be underreported. Countries have begun to monitor use of e-cigarettes and other emerging products, which may confound countries&#x2019; definitions of tobacco use. The definition of current use may not always be restricted to the 30 days prior to the survey. In addition, surveys ask people to self-report their tobacco use, which can lead to under-reporting of tobacco use. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is no standard protocol used across Member States to ask people about their tobacco use. WHO&#x2019;s Tobacco Questions for Surveys (TQS) have been adopted in many surveys, which helps improve comparability of indicators across countries. </p>"}
