{"status":"success","message":"The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 3-a-1, translated into en","data":"<p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong> </p>\n<p>WHO estimates differ from national estimates in that they are (i) age-standardised to improve international comparability and (ii) calculated using one standard method for all countries. Infrequent surveys or unavailability of recent surveys lead to more reliance on modelling. As the data set for each country improves over time with addition of new surveys, recent estimates may seem inconsistent with earlier estimates. WHO estimates undergo country consultation prior to release. </p>"}
