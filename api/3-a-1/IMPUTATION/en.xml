	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#xF0B7; At country level &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For countries with less than two national surveys completed in different years since 1990, no estimate is calculated, since no trend can be determined. For countries with data from two or more national surveys, data gaps, if any, are filled as described in the &lt;em&gt;Method of Computation&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#xF0B7; At regional and global levels &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries where no estimate can be calculated are included in regional and global averages by assuming their prevalence rates for men and women are equal to the average rates for men and women seen in the UN subregion1 in which they are located. Where fewer than 50% of a UN subregion&amp;#x2019;s population was surveyed, UN subregions are grouped with neighbouring subregions until at least 50% of the grouped population has contributed data to the region&amp;#x2019;s average rates. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
