{"status":"success","message":"The RATIONALE field for indicator 3-a-1, translated into en","data":"<p>Tobacco use is a major contributor to illness and death from non-communicable diseases (NCDs). There is no proven safe level of tobacco use or of second-hand smoke exposure. All daily and non-daily users of tobacco are at risk of a variety of poor health outcomes across the life-course, including NCDs. Reducing the prevalence of current tobacco use will make a large contribution to reducing premature mortality from NCDs (Target 3.4). Routine and regular monitoring of this indicator is necessary to enable accurate monitoring and evaluation of the impact of implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), or tobacco control policies in the countries that are not yet Parties to the WHO FCTC, over time. Tobacco use prevalence levels are an appropriate indicator of implementation of SDG Target 3.a &#x201C;Strengthen the implementation of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in all countries, as appropriate&#x201D;. </p>"}
