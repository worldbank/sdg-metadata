	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 8-9-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Target 8.9 has several dimensions and indicator 8.9.1 caters to the core intention of the target which calls to&lt;em&gt; &amp;#x201C;promote sustainable tourism&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#x201D;. While sustainable tourism is multidimensional in itself (with economic, social and environmental aspects), the economic contribution of tourism captured by this indicator, and (relative) increases or decreases in it, indicates the degree to which tourism is being successfully promoted. Ideally, this indicator needs to be complemented with additional indicators on the social (e.g. employment, etc.) and environmental (energy use, GHG emissions, etc.) aspects of tourism that can be disaggregated to provide a more complete picture of the promotion of sustainable tourism and thus the monitoring of this target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator is useful for policy on tourism at international, national level and the level of sub-national regions as it provides a measure of the economic contribution of tourism which can be compared over time, across countries, to total GDP and to the GDP contributions of other economic activities. Tourism Direct GDP includes the contributions from all forms of tourism&amp;#x2014;inbound tourism, domestic tourism and outbound tourism&amp;#x2014;in line with the International Recommendations for Tourism Statistics 2008 (IRTS 2008). The indicator has been found especially useful in raising awareness of the economic importance of tourism and making the case for a more proactive, sustainable management of a sector that is often overlooked in policy agendas at all levels. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
