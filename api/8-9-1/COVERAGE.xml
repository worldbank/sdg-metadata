&lt;p&gt;As of March 2022, more than 70 countries have data available for this indicator in 2020. The number of countries with a TSA exercise is monitored by SDG indicator 12.b.1. According to data reported by countries for the SDG indicator 12.b.1, more than 80 countries have conducted a TSA exercise in the period between 2016 and 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual data from 2008 onwards are available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDGDP is derived from the productive activities that cater directly to tourism and so it could be possible to disaggregate by tourism industries (e.g. accommodation for visitors, the different kinds of passenger transportation, etc.). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sub-national disaggregation/estimates of Tourism Direct GDP are possible and there are a number of countries&amp;#x2019; subnational regions that have information on this. However, there is no consensus on a methodology for doing this in a standardized way, compromising international comparability. In any case, it seems that collection of data would be warranted only for those regions where tourism is considered a significant (economic) activity and/or a policy priority. &lt;/p&gt;
