&lt;p&gt;More than 70 countries have some kind of TSA exercise and data available on this indicator, as shown in an international TSA data compilation exercise UNWTO realized in 2010 (see &amp;#x201C;&lt;a href=&quot;http://statistics.unwto.org/sites/all/files/pdf/tsa_data.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;TSA data around the world&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#x201D;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time series:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual data from 2008 onwards are available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDGDP is derived from the productive activities that cater directly to tourism and so it could be possible to disaggregate by tourism industries (e.g. accommodation for visitors, the different kinds of passenger transportation, etc.). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sub-national disaggregation/estimates of Tourism Direct GDP are possible and there are a number of subnational regions that have information on this. However, there is no consensus on a methodology for doing this in a standardized way, compromising international comparability. In any case, it seems that collection of data would be warranted only for those regions that consider tourism a significant (economic) activity. &lt;/p&gt;
