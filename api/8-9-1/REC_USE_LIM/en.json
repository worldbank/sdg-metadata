{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 8-9-1, translated into en","data":"<p>Given that a significant number of countries already have or are working to implement Tourism Satellite Accounts (TSA), data on the suggested indicators could become available in more countries in the near future. </p>\n<p>The data demands for implementing TSA (detailed input-output or supply and use tables, among others); means that it is often not possible or cost effective to realize frequent updating of the TSA. Therefore, some countries produce estimates of TSA aggregates, in between reference years and/or nowcast estimates, to have more current data and to produce a time series. </p>\n<p>In the absence of important shocks to the economy and to tourism, historically TDGDP/GDP tended to not show very large variations from one year to the next, however the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on tourism are quite evident through this indicator in many countries. Considering also that variations may stem from the numerator and/or denominator, it is often useful from an analytical perspective to consider the indicator in different forms and adaptations: absolute value, % change in constant price, and TDGDP per visitor or per employed person. </p>\n<p>Related economic aggregates on tourism like Tourism Direct Gross Value Added and the Gross Value Added of the Tourism Industries (in aggregate form and disaggregated by tourism industry) are also important and may be used as approximations to indicator 8.9.1 for analytical purposes. </p>"}
