	<message>The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 8-9-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt; Every year historical data is requested. If there are differences in the newly reported data for the country with respect to the data available previously, countries are consulted. Similarly, if other inconsistencies are found, there is ongoing follow up with countries. Since Table 6 of TSA is necessary for the compilation of TDGDP, the data reported by countries is cross-validated with the availability of this table through the data reported for SDG indicator 12.b.1, which also falls under the responsibility of UNWTO.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
