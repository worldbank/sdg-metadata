	<message>The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 8-9-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Every year historical data is requested. If there are differences in the newly reported data for the country with respect to the data available previously, countries are consulted. Similarly, if other inconsistencies are found, there is ongoing follow up with countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNWTO is also custodian for indicator 12.b.1 and the data collected there serves as a valuable validation step for the data provided for indicator 8.9.1. For example, since Table 6 of TSA is necessary for the compilation of TDGDP, the data reported by countries are cross validated with the availability of this table ( data reported for SDG indicator 12.b.1).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
