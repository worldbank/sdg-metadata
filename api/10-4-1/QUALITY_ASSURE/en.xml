	<message>The QUALITY_ASSURE field for indicator 10-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data consistency and quality checks are regularly conducted for validation of the data before dissemination in the ILOSTAT database. These checks consist of data and metadata revision of all the relevant inputs applying protocols to ensure that international comparability and time-series consistency are maintained. In many cases, input data are obtained through ILO processing of microdata sets of national household surveys. Data are also reported by national statistical offices or other relevant national agencies to the ILO Department of Statistics through its annual questionnaire on labour statistics. Data from international organizations official repositories are used as well. All these inputs are subject to the review procedure. For the resulting modelled estimates, both statistical and judgmental assessments of the output data are carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
