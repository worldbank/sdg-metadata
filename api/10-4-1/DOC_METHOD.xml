			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;In order to compute this indicator, two key variables are required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the national accounts estimates of GDP and compensation of employees. Comprehensive documentation on the System of National Accounts can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/sna.asp&quot;&gt;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/sna.asp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the necessary data to model and impute the labour income of the self-employed are national household survey microdata sets. For the methodology of each national household survey, one must refer to the most comprehensive survey report or to the methodological publications of the national statistical office in question. For detailed guidance on the estimation of the labour income of the self-employed please refer to sections 2.1-2.4 of: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/Labour%20income%20share%20and%20distribution.pdf&quot;&gt;The Global Labour Income Share and Distribution&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
