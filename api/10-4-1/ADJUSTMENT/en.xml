	<message>The ADJUSTMENT field for indicator 10-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;To ensure that the labour share data are internationally comparable, an adjustment for the labour income earned by the self-employed is necessary. Self-employment constitutes a large share of the global workforce. Moreover the share of the self-employed in the total workforce tends to be higher in countries with lower national income. As a consequence, using only national accounts data on compensation of employees &amp;#x2013; computing the unadjusted labour share &amp;#x2013; reduces international comparability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the ILO Harmonized Microdata collection, the labour income of the self-employed relative to the labour income of employees is imputed. The imputation is based on observable characteristics of workers, such as economic sector, occupation, education and age. For a description of the procedure please refer to sections 2.1-2.4 of: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/Labour%20income%20share%20and%20distribution.pdf&quot;&gt;The Global Labour Income Share and Distribution&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The labour income of the self-employed at the national level is computed on the basis of this estimate, and is added to the numerator of the expression in 4.c.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
