			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The recommended primary data sources for this indicator are the national accounts estimates of GDP and compensation of employees. The periodicity of this indicator will hence depend on the national accounts data produced in the given country. For self-employed workers, an imputation model is necessary to account for their labour income, in combination with national accounts data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source of the data should be presented when providing estimates of the indicator, as well as the System of National Accounts revision (preferably the SNA 2008). &lt;/p&gt;
