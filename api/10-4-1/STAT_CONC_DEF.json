Compensation of employees includes: (i) wages and salaries (in cash or in kind) and (ii) social insurance contributions payable by employers.

Thus, in addition to the compensation of employees, the indicator should also include the labour income of the self-employed.</p>\n<p>Gross domestic product (GDP) represents the market value of all final goods and services produced during a specific time period (for the purposes of this indicator, one year) in a country&apos;s territory.</p>\n<p>Persons in employment are defined as all those persons of working age who, during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. </p>\n<p>Persons in employment include employees and self-employed.</p>\n<p>Employees are all those workers who hold the type of job defined as paid employment jobs, that is, jobs where the incumbents hold explicit or implicit employment contracts giving them a basic remuneration not directly dependent on the revenue of the unit for which they work. </p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
