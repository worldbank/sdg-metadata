{"status":"success","message":"The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 10-4-1, translated into en","data":"<p>The data on compensation of employees and GDP used for the indicator is estimated at the country level, hence no substantial discrepancies should arise. In contrast, the adjustment to reflect the labour income of the self-employed can be a source of sizeable differences between national and international estimates.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The indicator is estimated using a model to impute the labour income of the self-employed on the basis of household survey microdata sets. This is done to provide a comprehensive estimate of labour income and to enhance the international comparability of the estimates. Country level estimates might rely on different models for imputing the labour income of the self-employed or not include the self-employed labour income at all. </p>\n<p>For a detailed description of the different procedures to produce the labour share and their performance please refer to sections 2.1-2.4, and section 3.1 of: <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/Labour%20income%20share%20and%20distribution.pdf\">The Global Labour Income Share and Distribution</a>.</p>"}
