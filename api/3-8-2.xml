&lt;p&gt;Proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two thresholds are used to define &amp;#x201C;large household expenditure on health&amp;#x201D;: greater than 10% and greater than 25% of total household expenditure or income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concepts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicator 3.8.2 is defined as the &amp;#x201C;Proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income&amp;#x201D;. In effect it is based on a ratio exceeding a threshold. The two main concepts of interest behind this ratio are household expenditure on health (numerator) and total household consumption expenditure or, when unavailable, income (denominator). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Numerator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Household expenditure on health is defined as any expenditure incurred at the time of service use to get any type of care (promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long-term care) including all medicines, vaccines and other pharmaceutical preparations as well as all health products, &lt;em&gt;from any type of provider and for all members of the household&lt;/em&gt;. These health expenditures are characterized by a direct payments that are financed by a household&amp;#x2019;s income (including remittances), savings or loans &lt;strong&gt;but do not include any third-party payer reimbursement. &lt;/strong&gt;As such they only grant access to the health services and health products individuals can pay for, without any solidarity between the healthy and the sick beyond the household&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-2&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and solely based on the willingness and ability of the household to pay. Direct health care payments are labelled Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) payments in the classification of health care financing schemes (HF) of the international Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA). OOP health expenditures are the most unequitable source of funding for the health system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The components of a household&amp;#x2019;s health care consumption expenditure so defined should be consistent with division 06 on health of the UN Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP) which currently includes expenditures on medicines and medical products (06.1), outpatient care services (06.2) and inpatient care services (06.3) but is being expanded&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-3&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-3&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further information on definitions and classifications (for example by provider, by beneficiary characteristics) of health expenditures should be consistent with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/health-accounts/methodology/en/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;international classification for health accounts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and its family of classifications. ICHA results from collaboration between OECD, Eurostat and the World Health Organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denominator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expenditure on household consumption and household income are both monetary welfare measures. Household consumption is a function of permanent income, which is a measure of a household&amp;#x2019;s long-term economic resources that determine living standards. Consumption is generally defined as the sum of the monetary values of all items (goods and services) consumed by the household on domestic account during a reference period. It includes the imputed values of goods and services that are not purchased but procured otherwise for consumption. Information on household consumption is usually collected in household surveys that may use different approaches to measure &amp;#x2018;consumption&amp;#x2019; depending on whether items refer to durable or non-durable goods and/or are directly produced by households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most relevant measure of income is disposable income as it is close to the maximum available to the household for consumption expenditure during the accounting period. Disposable income is defined as total income less direct taxes (net of refunds), compulsory fees and fines. Total income is generally composed of income from employment, property income, income from household production of services for own consumption, transfers received in cash and goods, transfers received as services&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-4&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-4&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Income is more difficult to measure accurately due to its greater variability over time. Consumption is less variable over time and easier to measure. It is therefore recommended that whenever there is information on both household consumption and income the former is used (see the &amp;#x201C;comments and limitations&amp;#x201D; section to learn more about the sensitivity of 3.8.2 to the income/expenditure choice in the denominator). Statistics on 3.8.2 currently produced by WHO and the World Bank predominantly rely on consumption (see section on data sources). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thresholds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is recommended to use two thresholds for global reporting to identify large household expenditure on health as share of total household consumption or income&lt;u&gt;: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;a lower threshold of 10% (3.8.2_10) and a higher threshold of 25% (3.8.2_25)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. With these two thresholds the indicator measures financial hardship &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (see section on comments and limitations). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-2&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/a-system-of-health-accounts/classification-of-health-care-financing-schemes-icha-hf_9789264116016-9-en&quot;&gt;http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/a-system-of-health-accounts/classification-of-health-care-financing-schemes-icha-hf_9789264116016-9-en&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-3&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; Agenda item 3(l) available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/49th-session/documents/&quot;&gt;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/49th-session/documents/&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcs.asp?Cl=5&amp;amp;Lg=1&amp;amp;Co=06.1&quot;&gt;http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcs.asp?Cl=5&amp;amp;Lg=1&amp;amp;Co=06.1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-3&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-4&quot;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/download/17thicls/r2hies.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/download/17thicls/r2hies.pdf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-4&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommended data sources for the monitoring of the &amp;#x201C;Proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income&amp;#x201D; are household surveys with information on both household consumption expenditure on health and total household consumption expenditures, which are routinely conducted by national statistical offices. Household budget surveys (HBS) and household income and expenditure surveys (HIES) typically collect these as they are primarily conducted to provide inputs to the calculation of consumer price indices or the compilation of national accounts. Another potential source of information is socio-economic or living standards surveys; however, some of these surveys may not collect information on total household consumption expenditures &amp;#x2013; for example, when a country measures poverty using income as the welfare measure&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-5&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-5&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The most important criterion for selecting a data source to measure SDG indicator 3.8.2 is the availability of both household consumption expenditure on health and total household consumption expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When socio-economic or living standards surveys are used to measure SDG indicator 3.8.2, any challenge for cross-country comparability of SDG Indicator 1.1.1 also applies to the monitoring of SDG indicator 3.8.2. For any type of household survey, given the focus on household health expenditure there is a need to improve the current survey instruments for cross-country comparability. The World Health Organization is collaborating with different UN agencies and other important stakeholder to ensure this happens&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-6&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-6&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-5&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf&quot;&gt;http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-5&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-6&quot;&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; One example is the WHO engagement in the ongoing revision of COICOP by UNSD &lt;a href=&quot;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/class/revisions/coicop_revision.asp&quot;&gt;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/class/revisions/coicop_revision.asp&lt;/a&gt; . Another example is a BMGF project WHO is supporting to improve the measurement of household health expenditures &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indepth-network.org/projects/ihope&quot;&gt;http://www.indepth-network.org/projects/ihope&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-6&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO obtains household survey data from national statistical offices where the denominator and numerator of the health expenditure ratio is constructed following their own guidelines either directly by them or by WHO consultants. WHO works through its regional offices or country offices to obtain access to data. No systematic adjustment is undertaken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank also typically receives data from National Statistical Offices (NSOs) directly. In other cases it uses NSO data received indirectly. For example, it receives data from Eurostat and from LIS (Luxembourg Income Study), who provide the World Bank NSO data they have received / harmonized. The Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina and the World Bank jointly maintain the SEDLAC (Socio-Economic Database for Latin American and Caribbean) database that includes harmonized statistics on poverty and other distributional and social variables from 24 Latin American and Caribbean countries, based on microdata from household surveys conducted by NSOs. Data is obtained through country specific programs, including technical assistance programs and joint analytical and capacity building activities. The World Bank has relationships with NSOs on work programs involving statistical systems and data analysis. Poverty economists from the World Bank typically engage with NSOs broadly on poverty measurement and analysis as part of technical assistance activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization and the World Bank generate indicator 3.8.2 following the same approach (see methodology). Both institutions combine estimates at the meso-level. Eligibility of the estimates included in a joint global database for the production of regional and global estimates is based on the following quality checks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the denominator of the health expenditure ratio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compare the logarithm of total per capita consumption in a benchmark source with the logarithm of total per capita consumption estimated from the survey. Both are expressed on a monthly basis in 2011 international (PPP) $. The benchmark source is taken from Povcalnet&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-7&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-7&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; if available, and otherwise from the World Development Indicators (WDI)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-8&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-8&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, computed as the household final consumption expenditures in constant 2011 international divided by total population. When the difference between the logarithm of total per capita consumption in the benchmark source and the logarithm of the value estimated from the survey as a share of the logarithm of total per capita consumption in the benchmark is greater than 10% when the comparison is with PovcalNet and greater than 15% when the comparison is made with the WDI the survey point is identified as an outlier internationally in terms of consumption per capita. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compare the poverty headcount estimated from the survey at the $1.90 a day poverty line in 2011 PPPs with the poverty incidence reported in PovcalNet at the same poverty line (benchmark value). When the absolute difference between the benchmark value and the survey estimate exceeds 10 percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in the incidence of extreme poverty and flagged for possible exclusion. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compare the poverty headcount estimated from the survey at the $3.10 a day poverty line in 2011 PPPs with the poverty incidence reported in PovcalNet at the same poverty line (benchmark value). When the absolute difference between the benchmark value and the survey estimate exceeds 10 percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in poverty headcount at $3.10 a day and flagged for possible exclusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the numerator of the health expenditure ratio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compare the average health expenditure ratio in the survey to a benchmark average budget share constructed as the ratio of the aggregate measure of household out-of-pocket expenditures in current local currency and aggregate household final consumption expenditure in current local currency. When the absolute difference exceeds 5 percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in terms of household budget share spent on health and flagged for possible exclusion. The macro-indicator of household out-of-pocket expenditures is available from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/health-accounts/ghed/en/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Global Health Expenditure Database&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (GHED)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-9&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-9&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;World Development Indicators Database&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (WDI)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-10&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-10&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Information on household final consumption expenditure is also extracted from WDI (series code: NE.CON.PRVT.CN).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These benchmarks are also used to decide between two estimates for those countries and those years for which both institutions have the same data source. For more information please refer to WHO and World Bank 2017 report on tracking universal health coverage as well as Wagstaff et al 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the quality assurance process, WHO and the World Bank assemble non-duplicated estimates of the proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income for each country. The World Health Organization then undertakes a country consultation process. Following a WHO Executive Board resolution (EB107.R8) WHO is requested to do this before publishing estimates at country level on behalf of member states. For any given indicator, this process starts with WHO sending a formal request to ministries of health to nominate a focal point for the consultation on the indicator. Once member states nominate focal points, WHO then sends draft estimates and methodological descriptions to them. STATA codes are available to reproduce the estimates shared. The focal points then send to WHO their comments, often including new data or revised country estimates that are used to update the country estimates. During the 2017 country consultation 137 WHO Member States nominated focal points, 100 of these received draft estimates and information on the methodology; 37 received only information on methodology as no draft estimate was produced. Of the 57 WHO Member States without focal points nominated estimates are available for 32 of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to such consultation, the World Health Organization and the World Bank regularly undertake training events on the measurement of lack of financial protection coverage, which involves participants from the Ministry of Health as well as from the National Statistical Office. WHO has several regional and national collaborations ongoing to support the production of indicator 3.8.2 as it has been recently adopted it is not yet routinely produced by National Statistical Office despite the data being available and the methodology simple. Results of such collaborations are not yet included in the database assembled by WHO and the World Bank but estimates produced by a country will be subject to the same quality assurance process just described.&lt;/p&gt;

Going forward, new data will be added as more information is received from nominated focal points (see collection process). Updates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of regional and global estimates are planned every two years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Statistical Offices in collaboration with Ministries of health. See data sources for further details. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization and the World Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Target 3.8 is defined as &amp;#x201C;Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all&amp;#x201D;. The concern is with all people and communities receiving the quality health services they need (including medicines and other health products), without financial hardship. Two indicators have been chosen to monitor target 3.8 within the SDG framework. Indicator 3.8.1 is for health service coverage, which is operationalized with an index that combines 16 health service coverage indicators for reproductive, maternal and child health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, and service capacity and access into a single summary metric. Indicator 3.8.2 focuses on health expenditures in relation to a household&amp;#x2019;s budget to identify financial hardship caused by direct health care payments. Taken together, indicators 3.8.1 and 3.8.2 are meant to capture the service coverage and financial protection dimensions, respectively, of target 3.8. These two indicators should be always monitored jointly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicator 3.8.2 derives from methodologies dating back to the 1990s developed in collaboration with academics at the World Bank and the World Health Organization. Indicator 3.8.2 is about identifying people that need to devote a substantial share of their total household expenditure or income to health care. The focus is on payments made at the point of use to get any type of treatment, from any type of provider, for any type of disease or health problem, net of any reimbursements to the individual who made the payment but excluding pre-payments for health services; for example, in the form of taxes or specific insurance premiums or contributions. Such direct payments are the least equitable way to finance the health systems given that they determine the extent of care received. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is clearly against the spirit of the target, which calls for granting access based on health needs not a household&amp;#x2019;s capacity to pull together all its financial resources to meet the health needs of its members. Some direct payments might be needed but indicator 3.8.2 is underpinned by the conviction that no one, at whatever income level, should have to choose between spending on health and spending on other basic goods and services such as education tuitions, food necessities, housing and utilities. One way of assessing the extent to which health systems lead to financial hardship is to calculate the proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health as a share of household total consumption or income. For detailed information on the definition chosen to monitor the financial protection dimension of universal health coverage within the SDG monitoring framework (indicator 3.8.2) please consult Wagstaff et al. (2018) and chapter 2 in the WHO and World Bank report on &amp;#x201C;Tracking universal health coverage: 2017 global monitoring report&amp;#x201D;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is feasible to monitor indicator 3.8.2 on a regular basis using the same household survey data that is used to monitor SDG target 1.1 and 1.2 on poverty&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-11&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-11&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. These surveys are also regularly conducted for other purposes such as calculating weights for the Consumer Price Index. These surveys are conducted typically by NSOs. Thus, monitoring the proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health as a share of total household consumption or income does not add any additional data collection burden so long as the health expenditure component of the household non-food consumption data can be identified. While this is an advantage, indicator 3.8.2 suffers from the same challenges of timeliness, frequency, data quality and comparability of surveys than SDG indicator 1.1.1. However, indicator 3.8.2 has its own conceptual and empirical limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, indicator 3.8.2 attempts to identify financial hardship that individuals face when using their income, savings or taking loans to pay for health care. However, most household surveys fail to identify the source of funding used by a household who is reporting health expenditure. In countries where there is no retrospective reimbursement of household spending on health this is not a problem. If a household does report any expenditure on health, it would be because it is not going to be reimbursed by any third-party payer. It is therefore consistent with the definition given for direct health care payments (the numerator). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those countries on the other hand where there is retrospective reimbursement &amp;#x2013; for example, via a contributory health insurance scheme - the amount reported by a household on health expenditures might be totally or partially reimbursed at some later point, perhaps outside the recall period of the household survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, more work is needed to ensure that survey instruments gather information on the sources of funding used by the household to pay for health care, or the household survey instrument always specifies that health expenditures should be net of any reimbursement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, in the current definition of indicator 3.8.2 large health expenditures can be identified by comparing how much household spend on health to either household income or total household expenditure. Expenditure is the recommended measure of household&amp;#x2019;s resources (see concept section) but recent empirical work has demonstrated that while statistics on 3.8.2 at country level are fairly robust to such choice, their disaggregation by income group is pretty sensitive to it. Income based measures show a greater concentration of the proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health among the poor than expenditure based measures (see chapter 2 in the WHO and World Bank 2017 report on tracking universal health coverage as well as Wagstaff et al 2018) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, indicator 3.8.2. relies on a single cut-off point to identify what constitutes &amp;#x2018;large health expenditure as a share of total household expenditure or income&amp;#x2019;. People just below such threshold are not taken into account, which is always the problem with measures based on cut-offs. This is simply avoided by plotting the cumulative distribution function of the health expenditure ratio behind 3.8.2. By doing so, it is possible to identify for any threshold the proportion of the population that is devoting any share of its household&amp;#x2019;s budget to health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, indicator 3.8.2. is based on measures of ex-post spending on health care. Low levels of spending could be driven by measurement errors due to both non-sampling errors such as a very short recall period that does not allow the collection of information on health care requiring an overnight stay; or sampling errors such as over-sample of areas with a particularly low burden of disease. No spending could also be due to people not being able to spend anything on health which, at least for the services that are included in 3.8.1, should result in low levels of coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other indicators used to measure financial hardship. WHO uses a framework which includes , in addition to indicator 3.8.2, a definition of large health expenditure in relation to non-subsistence spending&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-12&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-12&quot;&gt;[11]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-13&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-13&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-14&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-14&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-11&quot;&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf&quot;&gt;http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-11&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-12&quot;&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chapter 2 in &amp;#x201C;Tracking universal health coverage: 2017 global monitoring report&amp;#x201D;, World Health Organization and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/ The World Bank; 2017; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/healthinfo/indicators/2015/en/&quot;&gt;http://www.who.int/healthinfo/indicators/2015/en/&lt;/a&gt; ; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-12&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-13&quot;&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xu, K., Evans, D.

  &lt;/math&gt; is a threshold identifying large household expenditure on health as a share of total household consumption or income (i.e. 10% and 25%). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Household health expenditure and household expenditure or income are defined as explained in the &amp;#x201C;concept&amp;#x201D; section. For more information about the methodology please refer to Wagstaff et al (2018) and chapter 2 in the WHO and World Bank 2017 report on tracking universal health coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment of missing values:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the country level no imputation is attempted to produce estimates. The proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income is estimated for all years for which a nationally representative survey on household budget, household income and expenditure, socio-economic conditions or living standards is available with information on both total household expenditure or income and total household expenditure on health. When there are multiple surveys over time for the same country a preference is given to estimates produced based on the same survey. A series of tests is performed to retain the best performing series (see collection process).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To construct regional and global level estimates, when survey-based estimates are not available for the reference years of 2000, 2005 or 2010 all survey-based estimates within a 5 year window of the reference year are &amp;#x201C;lined-up&amp;#x201D; by using a combination of interpolation, extrapolation, econometric modelling and imputation based on regional medians ( Wagstaff et al.,2018; chapter 2 of the 2017 WHO and World Bank report on tracking universal health care coverage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank and the World Health Organization use their own regional grouping, in addition to the regional breakdown proposed for the SDG by UNSD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator relies primarily on the same data sources that are used to monitor SDG indicator 1.1.1 with the additional requirement of the availability of information regarding health expenditures. Taking this into account, the World Bank and WHO have identified 1566 potentially suitable household survey datasets from 155 countries. Some of these surveys were excluded because they were either inaccessible, lacked key variables required for the estimation of the proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health as a share of total household expenditure or income, they did not pass the quality assurance process or were not part of a consistent time series. As of December 2017 a total of 553 datapoints from 132 countries or territories spanning the period 1984-2015 have been used to produce SDG indicator 3.8.2 . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data availability measured in terms of the number of countries that WHO and the World Bank have currently reviewed and retained for the estimation of the &amp;#x201C;proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health as a share of total household expenditure or income&amp;#x201D; is as follows for the most recent year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall data availability covers at least 50% of all WHO member States in all M49 regions except for those in Oceania (7.1%). For more information, please consult WHO and World Bank 2017 report on tracking universal health ; Wagstaff et al 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frequency of such data is similar to the frequency of the data used to produced SDG indicator 1.1.1. It varies across countries but on average, this ranges from an annual 1 year basis to 3 to 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following disaggregation is possible in so far as the survey has been designed to provide representative estimates at such level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gender and age of the head of the household&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Geographic location (rural/urban)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quintiles of the household welfare measures (total household expenditure or income). See comments and limitations for the sensitivity of the disaggregation to the choice of the welfare measure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Country level estimates are all based on nationally representative surveys with information on both household total expenditure or income and household expenditure on health (see data sources). In most cases such data come from non-standard household surveys and ex-post standardization processes can be designed to increase the degree of comparability across countries. For instance, regional teams from the World Bank produce standardized versions of raw datasets following common regional procedures: the ECAPOV harmonized datasets are based on the Living Standards Measurement Study datasets &amp;#x2013; LSMS&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-15&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-15&quot;&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or household budget surveys (HBS) collected in the World Bank&amp;#x2019;s Europe and Central Asia region; the SHIP collection results from a poverty program on harmonized household surveys in the World Bank&amp;#x2019;s African region, while the SHES collection was developed by the World Bank for the international comparison program&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-16&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-16&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The Luxembourg income study (LIS) datasets results from effort to harmonize datasets from many high and middle-income countries&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-17&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-17&quot;&gt;[16]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases the raw data is accessible to produce country level estimates. In some countries in addition to the raw data a standardized version of it is available and in other countries only the standardized version is. When multiple versions of the same survey are available the best performing in terms of a series of quality assurance tests is retained (see collection process). When a standardized version of a nationally designed survey instruments is chosen there are differences between expenditure variables generated using the raw data, and the expenditure variables generated using the harmonization procedures which might result in different estimated incidence of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of household total expenditure or income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-15&quot;&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTLSMS/0,,contentMDK:21610833~pagePK:64168427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:3358997,00.html &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-15&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-16&quot;&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; A detailed documentation describing the harmonization procedures is available from the accompanying pdf documents &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-16&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-17&quot;&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; http://www.lisdatacenter.org/ &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-17&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://apps.who.int/gho/cabinet/uhc.jsp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;http://apps.who.int/gho/cabinet/uhc.jsp&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://datatopics.worldbank.org/universal-health-coverage/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;http://datatopics.worldbank.org/universal-health-coverage/&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Conceptos y definiciones&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definición:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proporción de la población con un gran gasto familiar en salud en relación con el gasto o los ingresos totales del hogar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Se utilizan dos umbrales para definir el &amp;#x201C;gran gasto de los hogares en salud&amp;#x201D;: más del 10% y más del 25% del total de gastos o ingresos de los hogares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conceptos:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El indicador 3.8.2 se define como la &amp;#x201C;Proporción de la población con grandes gastos de los hogares en salud en relación con los gastos o ingresos totales de los hogares&amp;#x201D;. En efecto, se basa en una proporción que supera un umbral. Los dos principales conceptos de interés que subyacen a este ratio son el gasto de los hogares en salud (numerador) y el gasto de consumo total de los hogares o, cuando no se dispone de él, los ingresos (denominador).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Numerador&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El gasto de los hogares en salud se define como cualquier gasto realizado en el momento de la utilización del servicio para obtener cualquier tipo de atención (promocional, preventiva, curativa, de rehabilitación, paliativa o de larga duración), incluidos todos los medicamentos, vacunas y otros preparados farmacéuticos, así como todos los productos sanitarios, &lt;em&gt; de cualquier tipo de proveedor y para todos los miembros del hogar&lt;/em&gt;. Estos gastos sanitarios se caracterizan por ser pagos directos que se financian con los ingresos del hogar &amp;#x2019;, las remesas, los ahorros o los préstamos &lt;strong&gt;, pero no incluyen ningún reembolso pagado por terceros. &lt;/strong&gt;Como tales, sólo conceden acceso a los servicios y productos sanitarios que los individuos pueden pagar, sin ninguna solidaridad entre los sanos y los enfermos más allá del hogar&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-1&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; y basándose únicamente en la voluntad y la capacidad de pago del hogar. Los pagos directos de asistencia sanitaria se denominan pagos de bolsillo (OOP, por su sigla en inglés) en la clasificación de los sistemas de financiación de la asistencia sanitaria (HF, por su sigla en inglés) de la Clasificación Internacional de las Cuentas de Salud (ICHA, por su sigla en inglés). Los gastos sanitarios OOP son la fuente de financiación más desigual del sistema sanitario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Los componentes del gasto de consumo sanitario de un hogar&amp;#x2019;así definidos deben ser coherentes con la división 06 de salud de la Clasificación de Consumo Individual según la Finalidad (COICOP, por su sigla en inglés) de las Naciones Unidas, que actualmente incluye los gastos en medicamentos y productos médicos (06.1), servicios de atención ambulatoria (06.2) y servicios de atención hospitalaria (06.3), pero que se está ampliando&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-2&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La información adicional sobre las definiciones y clasificaciones (por ejemplo, por proveedor, por características del beneficiario) de los gastos de salud debe ser coherente con la &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/health-accounts/methodology/en/&quot;&gt;clasificación internacional de cuentas de salud&lt;/a&gt; y su familia de clasificaciones. La ICHA es el resultado de la colaboración entre la OCDE, Eurostat y la Organización Mundial de la Salud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denominator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El gasto en consumo de los hogares y la renta de los hogares son medidas de bienestar monetario. El consumo de los hogares es una función de la renta permanente, que es una medida de los recursos económicos a largo plazo de un hogar que determinan el nivel de vida. El consumo se define generalmente como la suma de los valores monetarios de todos los artículos (bienes y servicios) consumidos por el hogar por cuenta propia durante un periodo de referencia. Incluye los valores imputados de los bienes y servicios que no se compran pero que se adquieren de otro modo para el consumo. La información sobre el consumo de los hogares suele recopilarse en encuestas a hogares que pueden utilizar diferentes enfoques para medir el &amp;#x2018;consumo&amp;#x2019; dependiendo si los artículos se refieren a bienes duraderos o no duraderos y/o si son producidos directamente por los hogares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La medida más relevante de la renta es la renta disponible, ya que se aproxima al máximo disponible del hogar para el gasto de consumo durante el período contable. La renta disponible se define como la renta total menos los impuestos directos (netos de devoluciones), las tasas obligatorias y las multas. La renta total se compone generalmente de las rentas del trabajo, de las rentas de la propiedad, de las rentas de la producción de servicios del hogar para el consumo propio, de las transferencias recibidas en efectivo y en bienes, y de las transferencias recibidas en forma de servicios&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-3&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La renta es más difícil de medir con precisión debido a su mayor variabilidad en el tiempo. El consumo es menos variable en el tiempo y más fácil de medir. Por lo tanto, se recomienda que siempre que haya información tanto del consumo como de los ingresos de los hogares se utilice el primero (véase la sección &amp;#x201C;comentarios y limitaciones&amp;#x201D; para saber más sobre la sensibilidad de 3.8.2 a la elección de ingresos/gastos en el denominador). Las estadísticas sobre 3.8.2 elaboradas actualmente por la OMS y el Banco Mundial se basan predominantemente en el consumo (véase la sección sobre fuentes de datos).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thresholds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Se recomienda utilizar dos umbrales para la presentación de informes globales a fin de identificar los grandes gastos de los hogares en salud como proporción del consumo o los ingresos totales de los hogares&lt;u&gt;: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;un umbral inferior del 10% (3.8.2_10) y un umbral superior del 25% (3.8.2_25)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Con estos dos umbrales, el indicador mide las dificultades financieras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(véase la sección de comentarios y limitaciones).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/a-system-of-health-accounts/classification-of-health-care-financing-schemes-icha-hf_9789264116016-9-en&quot;&gt;http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/a-system-of-health-accounts/classification-of-health-care-financing-schemes-icha-hf_9789264116016-9-en&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-1&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;p&gt; Ítem 3(l) disponible en &lt;a href=&quot;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/49th-session/documents/&quot;&gt;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/49th-session/documents/&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcs.asp?Cl=5&amp;amp;Lg=1&amp;amp;Co=06.1&quot;&gt;http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcs.asp?Cl=5&amp;amp;Lg=1&amp;amp;Co=06.1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/download/17thicls/r2hies.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/download/17thicls/r2hies.pdf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-3&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Fuentes de datos&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Descripción:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Las fuentes de datos recomendadas para el seguimiento de la &amp;#x201C;Proporción de la población con un gran gasto en salud de los hogares como proporción del gasto o los ingresos totales de los hogares&amp;#x201D; son las encuestas a hogares con información sobre el gasto de consumo de los hogares en salud y el gasto de consumo total de los hogares, que realizan habitualmente las oficinas nacionales de estadística. Las encuestas sobre el presupuesto de los hogares (EPH) y las encuestas sobre los ingresos y los gastos de los hogares (HIES, por su sigla en inglés) suelen recopilar estos datos, ya que se llevan a cabo principalmente para proporcionar información para el cálculo de los índices de precios al consumo o la compilación de las cuentas nacionales. Otra posible fuente de información son las encuestas socio-económicas o de nivel de vida; sin embargo, algunas de estas encuestas pueden no recopilar información sobre el gasto total de consumo de los hogares &amp;#x2013;, por ejemplo, cuando un país mide la pobreza utilizando los ingresos como medida de bienestar&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-4&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. El criterio más importante para seleccionar una fuente de datos para medir el indicador 3.8.2 de los ODS es la disponibilidad tanto del gasto de consumo de los hogares en salud como del gasto de consumo total de los hogares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuando se utilizan encuestas socio-económicas o de nivel de vida para medir el indicador 3.8.2 de los ODS, cualquier problema de comparabilidad entre países del indicador 1.1.1 de los ODS se aplica también al seguimiento del indicador 3.8.2 de los ODS. Para cualquier tipo de encuesta a hogares, dado que se centra en el gasto sanitario de los hogares, es necesario mejorar los instrumentos de encuestas actuales para que sean comparables entre países. La Organización Mundial de la Salud está colaborando con diferentes organismos de las Naciones Unidas y otras partes interesadas importantes para garantizar que esto ocurra&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-5&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf&quot;&gt;http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-4&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;p&gt; Un ejemplo es la participación de la OMS en la revisión en curso de la COICOP por parte de la UNSD (por su sigla en inglés)&lt;a href=&quot;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/class/revisions/coicop_revision.asp&quot;&gt;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/class/revisions/coicop_revision.asp&lt;/a&gt;. Otro ejemplo es un proyecto del BMGF (por su sigla en inglés) que la OMS apoya para mejorar la medición de los gastos sanitarios de los hogares &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indepth-network.org/projects/ihope&quot;&gt;http://www.indepth-network.org/projects/ihope&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-5&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Proceso de recolección:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La OMS obtiene los datos de las encuestas a hogares de las oficinas nacionales de estadística, donde el denominador y el numerador del ratio de gasto sanitario se construye siguiendo sus propias directrices, ya sea directamente por ellos o por consultores de la OMS. La OMS trabaja a través de sus oficinas regionales o de las oficinas en los países para obtener acceso a los datos. No se realiza ningún ajuste sistemático.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Banco Mundial también suele recibir directamente los datos de las Oficinas Nacionales de Estadística (ONEs). En otros casos, utiliza datos de las ONEs recibidos indirectamente. Por ejemplo, recibe datos de Eurostat y de LIS (Luxembourg Income Study), que proporcionan al Banco Mundial los datos de las ONEs que han recibido o armonizado. La Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina, y el Banco Mundial mantienen conjuntamente la base de datos SEDLAC (Base de datos socio-económicos para América Latina y el Caribe) que incluye estadísticas armonizadas sobre la pobreza y otras variables distributivas y sociales de 24 países de América Latina y el Caribe, basadas en microdatos de encuestas a hogares realizadas por las ONEs. Los datos se obtienen a través de programas específicos para cada país, incluyendo programas de asistencia técnica y actividades conjuntas de análisis y desarrollo de capacidades. El Banco Mundial se relaciona con las ONEs en programas de trabajo relacionados con los sistemas estadísticos y el análisis de datos. Los economistas especializados en pobreza del Banco Mundial suelen colaborar con las ONEs en la medición y el análisis de la pobreza como parte de las actividades de asistencia técnica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Organización Mundial de la Salud y el Banco Mundial generan el indicador 3.8.2 siguiendo el mismo enfoque (véase la metodología). Ambas instituciones combinan las estimaciones a nivel meso. La elegibilidad de las estimaciones incluidas en una base de datos mundial conjunta para la producción de estimaciones regionales y mundiales se basa en los siguientes controles de calidad:.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Para el denominador del ratio de gasto sanitario&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparar el logaritmo del consumo total per cápita en una fuente de referencia con el logaritmo del consumo total per cápita estimado a partir de la encuesta. La fuente de referencia se toma de Povcalnet&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-6&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; si está disponible, y si no, de los Indicadores de Desarrollo Mundial (IDM)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-7&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-7&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, calculados como los gastos de consumo final de los hogares en moneda internacional constante de 2011 divididos por la población total. Cuando la diferencia entre el logaritmo del consumo total per cápita en la fuente de referencia y el logaritmo del valor estimado a partir de la encuesta como proporción del logaritmo del consumo total per cápita en la fuente de referencia es superior al 10%, cuando la comparación es con PovcalNet y superior al 15%, o cuando la comparación se realiza con los IDM (Indicadores de Desarrollo Mundial del Banco Mundial), el punto de la encuesta se identifica como un valor atípico a nivel internacional en términos de consumo per cápita.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparar el recuento de la pobreza estimado a partir de la encuesta en la línea de pobreza de 1,90 dólares al día en PPA de 2011 con la incidencia de la pobreza informada en PovcalNet en la misma línea de pobreza (valor de referencia). Cuando la diferencia absoluta entre el valor de referencia y la estimación de la encuesta supera los 10 puntos porcentuales, el punto de la encuesta se identifica como un valor atípico en la incidencia de la pobreza extrema y se marca para su posible exclusión. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparar el recuento de la pobreza estimado a partir de la encuesta en la línea de pobreza de 3,10 dólares al día en PPA de 2011 con la incidencia de la pobreza informada en PovcalNet en la misma línea de pobreza (valor de referencia). Cuando la diferencia absoluta entre el valor de referencia y la estimación de la encuesta supera los 10 puntos porcentuales, el punto de la encuesta se identifica como un valor atípico en el recuento de la pobreza a 3,10 dólares al día y se marca para su posible exclusión&lt;/li&gt;.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Para el numerador del ratio de gasto sanitario&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparar el ratio de gasto en salud medio en la encuesta con una cuota presupuestaria media de referencia construida como el ratio de la medida agregada de los gastos de bolsillo de los hogares en moneda local corriente y el gasto de consumo final agregado de los hogares en moneda local corriente. Cuando la diferencia absoluta supera los 5 puntos porcentuales, el punto de la encuesta se identifica como un valor atípico en cuanto a la proporción del presupuesto de los hogares que se gasta en salud y se marca para su posible exclusión. El macroindicador del gasto de bolsillo de los hogares está disponible en la &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/health-accounts/ghed/en/&quot;&gt;Global Health Expenditure Database&lt;/a&gt; (GHED, por su sigla en inglés)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-8&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-8&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; y en la &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators&quot;&gt;World Development Indicators Database&lt;/a&gt; (WDI, por su sigla en inglés)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-9&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-9&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. La información sobre el gasto en consumo final de los hogares también se extrae de los IDM (código de la serie: NE.CON.PRVT.CN)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estos puntos de referencia también se utilizan para decidir entre dos estimaciones para aquellos países y aquellos años para los que ambas instituciones tienen la misma fuente de datos. Para más información, consulte el informe de la OMS y el Banco Mundial de 2017 sobre el seguimiento de la cobertura sanitaria universal, así como Wagstaff et al 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al final del proceso de garantía de calidad, la OMS y el Banco Mundial reúnen estimaciones no duplicadas de la proporción de la población con un gran gasto familiar en salud como proporción del gasto o los ingresos totales de los hogares para cada país. A continuación, la Organización Mundial de la Salud lleva a cabo un proceso de consulta con los países. A raíz de una resolución del Consejo Ejecutivo de la OMS (EB107.R8), se pide a la OMS que haga esto antes de publicar las estimaciones a nivel de país en nombre de los Estados miembros. Para cualquier indicador, este proceso comienza con el envío por parte de la OMS de una solicitud formal a los Ministerios de Salud para que designen un punto focal para la consulta sobre el indicador. Una vez que los Estados miembros nombran a los puntos focales, la OMS les envía los borradores de las estimaciones y las descripciones metodológicas. Los códigos STATA están disponibles para reproducir las estimaciones compartidas. A continuación, los puntos focales envían a la OMS sus comentarios, a menudo incluyendo nuevos datos o estimaciones revisadas de los países que se utilizan para actualizar las estimaciones de los países. Durante la consulta de países de 2017, 137 Estados miembros de la OMS designaron puntos focales, 100 de los cuales recibieron proyectos de estimaciones e información sobre la metodología; 37 sólo recibieron información sobre la metodología, ya que no se elaboró ningún proyecto de estimación. De los 57 Estados miembros de la OMS sin puntos focales designados se dispone de estimaciones para 32 de ellos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Además de estas consultas, la Organización Mundial de la Salud y el Banco Mundial organizan periódicamente eventos de formación sobre la medición de la falta de cobertura de protección financiera, en los que participan tanto el Ministerio de Salud como la Oficina Nacional de Estadística. La OMS tiene varias colaboraciones regionales y nacionales en curso para apoyar la producción del indicador 3.8.2, ya que ha sido adoptado recientemente y todavía no es producido de forma rutinaria por la Oficina Nacional de Estadística a pesar que los datos están disponibles y la metodología es sencilla. Los resultados de estas colaboraciones aún no se incluyen en la base de datos reunida por la OMS y el Banco Mundial, pero las estimaciones producidas por un país se someterán al mismo proceso de garantía de calidad que se acaba de describir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/povOnDemand.aspx&quot;&gt;http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/povOnDemand.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-6&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators&quot;&gt;https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-7&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/health-accounts/ghed/en/&quot;&gt;http://www.who.int/health-accounts/ghed/en/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-8&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators&quot;&gt;https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-9&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Calendario&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recopilación de datos:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La recopilación de datos sigue el plan de un país&amp;#x2019;para realizar encuestas de gasto de consumo de los hogares, encuestas de presupuesto de los hogares y encuestas de ingresos y gastos de los hogares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Publicación de datos:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En diciembre de 2017 se publicaron las estimaciones sobre la proporción de la población con un gran gasto familiar en salud como porcentaje del gasto o los ingresos totales del hogar. En adelante, se añadirán nuevos datos a medida que se reciba más información de los puntos focales designados (véase el proceso de recopilación). Actualizaciones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;de las estimaciones regionales y mundiales están previstas cada dos años.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Proveedores de datos&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oficinas Nacionales de Estadística en colaboración con los Ministerios de Salud. Ver fuentes de datos para más detalles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Compiladores de datos&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Organización Mundial de la Salud y el Banco Mundial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Justificación:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La meta 3.8 se define como &amp;#x201C;Lograr la cobertura sanitaria universal, incluida la protección contra los riesgos financieros, el acceso a servicios esenciales de atención sanitaria de calidad y el acceso a medicamentos y vacunas esenciales seguros, eficaces, de calidad y asequibles para todos&amp;#x201D;. La preocupación es que todas las personas y comunidades reciban los servicios de salud de calidad que necesitan (incluidos medicamentos y otros productos de salud), sin dificultades financieras. Se han elegido dos indicadores para el seguimiento de la meta 3.8 en el marco de los ODS. El indicador 3.8.1 se refiere a la cobertura de los servicios de salud, que se pone en práctica con un índice que combina 16 indicadores de cobertura de los servicios de salud para la salud reproductiva, materna e infantil, enfermedades infecciosas, enfermedades no transmisibles y capacidad y acceso a los servicios en una sola métrica resumida. El indicador 3.8.2 se centra en los gastos de salud en relación con el presupuesto de un hogar para identificar las dificultades financieras causadas por los pagos directos de atención médica. En conjunto, los indicadores 3.8.1 y 3.8.2 tienen por objeto captar las dimensiones de cobertura de servicios y protección financiera, respectivamente, de la meta 3.8. Estos dos indicadores deberían ser siempre objeto de un seguimiento conjunto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El indicador 3.8.2 se deriva de metodologías que se remontan al período de 1990 elaboradas en colaboración con académicos del Banco Mundial y la Organización Mundial de la Salud. El indicador 3.8.2 trata de identificar a las personas que necesitan dedicar una parte sustancial de sus gastos o ingresos totales de los hogares a la atención de la salud. La atención se centra en los pagos realizados en el punto de uso para obtener cualquier tipo de tratamiento, de cualquier tipo de proveedor, para cualquier tipo de enfermedad o problema de salud, neto de cualquier reembolso a la persona que realizó el pago, pero excluyendo los pagos anticipados por servicios de salud, por ejemplo, en forma de impuestos o primas o contribuciones específicas de seguros. Estos pagos directos son la forma menos equitativa de financiar los sistemas de salud, dado que determinan el alcance de la atención recibida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esto va claramente en contra del espíritu de la meta, que exige conceder acceso basado en las necesidades de salud y no la capacidad de un hogar para reunir todos sus recursos financieros para satisfacer las necesidades de salud de sus miembros. Es posible que se necesiten algunos pagos directos, pero el indicador 3.8.2 se basa en la convicción de que nadie, independientemente de su nivel de ingresos, debería tener que elegir entre el gasto en salud y el gasto en otros bienes y servicios básicos, como la enseñanza, las necesidades alimentarias, la vivienda y los servicios públicos. Una forma de evaluar la medida en que los sistemas de salud conducen a dificultades financieras es calcular la proporción de la población con grandes gastos familiares en salud como proporción del consumo o los ingresos totales de los hogares. Para obtener información detallada sobre la definición elegida para supervisar la dimensión de protección financiera de la cobertura sanitaria universal dentro del marco de seguimiento de los ODS (indicador 3.8.2), consulte Wagstaff et al. (2018) y el capítulo 2 del informe de la OMS y el Banco Mundial sobre &amp;#x201C;Seguimiento de la cobertura sanitaria universal: informe de seguimiento mundial de 2017&amp;#x201D;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Comentarios y limitaciones:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es posible realizar un seguimiento periódico del indicador 3.8.2 utilizando los mismos datos de las encuestas a hogares que se utilizan para el seguimiento de las metas 1.1 y 1.2 de los ODS sobre la pobreza&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-10&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-10&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Estas encuestas también se realizan periódicamente para otros fines, como el cálculo de las ponderaciones para el Índice de Precios al Consumo. Estas encuestas suelen ser realizadas por las ONEs. Por lo tanto, el monitoreo de la proporción de la población con grandes gastos del hogar en salud como proporción del consumo o ingreso total del hogar no agrega ninguna carga adicional de recolección de datos, siempre y cuando se pueda identificar el componente de gasto en salud de los datos de consumo no alimentario del hogar. Si bien esto es una ventaja, el indicador 3.8.2 sufre los mismos problemas de puntualidad, frecuencia, calidad de los datos y comparabilidad de las encuestas que el indicador 1.1.1 de los ODS. Sin embargo, el indicador 3.8.2 tiene sus propias limitaciones conceptuales y empíricas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En primer lugar, el indicador 3.8.2 trata de identificar las dificultades financieras a las que se enfrentan los individuos cuando utilizan sus ingresos, ahorros o toman préstamos para pagar la atención sanitaria. Sin embargo, la mayoría de las encuestas a hogares no identifican la fuente de financiación utilizada por un hogar que declara gastos de salud. En los países en los que no existe un reembolso retrospectivo del gasto de los hogares en salud, esto no es un problema. Si un hogar notifica algún gasto en salud, será porque no va a ser reembolsado por ningún tercero. Por lo tanto, es coherente con la definición dada para los pagos directos de asistencia sanitaria (el numerador).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Por otra parte, en aquellos países en los que existe un reembolso retrospectivo, por ejemplo, a través de un esquema de seguro de salud contributivo, el monto reportado por un hogar sobre los gastos de salud podría ser total o parcialmente reembolsado en algún momento posterior, tal vez fuera del período de recolección de datos de la encuesta a hogares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidentemente, es necesario trabajar más para garantizar que los instrumentos de las encuestas recopilen información sobre las fuentes de financiación utilizadas por el hogar para pagar la atención sanitaria, o que los instrumentos de las encuestas a hogares especifiquen siempre que los gastos sanitarios deben ser netos de cualquier reembolso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En segundo lugar, en la definición actual del indicador 3.8.2 los grandes gastos en salud pueden identificarse comparando cuánto gastan los hogares en salud con los ingresos del hogar o con el gasto total del hogar. El gasto es la medida recomendada de los recursos de los hogares (véase la sección de conceptos), pero los trabajos empíricos recientes han demostrado que, si bien las estadísticas del indicador 3.8.2 a nivel de país son bastante robustas a dicha elección, su desagregación por grupo de ingresos es bastante sensible a la misma. Las medidas basadas en los ingresos muestran una mayor concentración de la proporción de la población con grandes gastos familiares en salud entre los pobres que las medidas basadas en los gastos (véase el capítulo 2 del informe de la OMS y el Banco Mundial de 2017 sobre el seguimiento de la cobertura sanitaria universal, así como Wagstaff et al 2018).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En tercer lugar, el indicador 3.8.2. se basa en un único punto de corte para identificar lo que constituye un &amp;#x2018;gran gasto sanitario como proporción del gasto o los ingresos totales del hogar&amp;#x2019;. Las personas que se encuentran justo por debajo de dicho umbral no se tienen en cuenta, lo que siempre es un problema con las medidas basadas en puntos de corte. Esto se evita simplemente trazando la función de distribución acumulativa del coeficiente de gasto sanitario detrás de 3.8.2. Al hacerlo, es posible identificar, para cualquier umbral, la proporción de la población que dedica alguna parte del presupuesto de su hogar a la salud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En cuarto lugar, el indicador 3.8.2. se basa en medidas de gasto ex-post en atención sanitaria. Los bajos niveles de gasto podrían deberse a errores de medición debidos tanto a errores ajenos al muestreo, como un periodo de recuerdo muy corto que no permite recopilar información sobre la atención sanitaria que requiere una estancia de una noche; o a errores de muestreo, como un exceso de muestreo de zonas con una carga de enfermedad especialmente baja. La ausencia de gasto también podría deberse a que la gente no puede gastar nada en salud, lo que, al menos para los servicios que se incluyen en 3.8.1, debería dar lugar a niveles bajos de cobertura.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hay otros indicadores utilizados para medir las dificultades económicas.

&lt;p&gt;donde &lt;em&gt;i &lt;/em&gt;denota un hogar,&lt;em&gt; 1()&lt;/em&gt; es la función indicadora que toma el valor 1 si la expresión entre corchetes es verdadera, y 0 en caso contrario, &lt;em&gt;m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; corresponde al número de miembros del hogar de &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;, corresponde a la ponderación muestral del hogar &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;, es un umbral que identifica el gran gasto del hogar en salud como proporción del consumo o los ingresos totales del hogar (es decir, 10% y 25%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El gasto sanitario de los hogares y los gastos o ingresos de los hogares se definen como se explica en la sección &amp;#x201C;concepto&amp;#x201D;. Para más información sobre la metodología, consulte Wagstaff et al (2018) y el capítulo 2 del informe de la OMS y el Banco Mundial de 2017 sobre el seguimiento de la cobertura sanitaria universal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tratamiento de valores faltantes: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nivel de país no se intenta la imputación para producir estimaciones. La proporción de la población con un gran gasto del hogar en salud como proporción del gasto o los ingresos totales del hogar se estima para todos los años para los que se dispone de una encuesta nacional representativa sobre el presupuesto del hogar, los ingresos y gastos del hogar, las condiciones socio-económicas o el nivel de vida con información tanto sobre el gasto o los ingresos totales del hogar como sobre el gasto total del hogar en salud. Cuando existen múltiples encuestas a lo largo del tiempo para un mismo país, se da preferencia a las estimaciones elaboradas a partir de la misma encuesta. Se realiza una serie de pruebas para retener las series con mejores resultados (véase el Proceso de recolección).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Agregados regionales:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Para construir las estimaciones a nivel regional y mundial, cuando no se dispone de estimaciones basadas en encuestas para los años de referencia 2000, 2005 o 2010, se alinean todas las estimaciones basadas en encuestas dentro de una ventana de 5 años del año de referencia utilizando una combinación de interpolación, extrapolación, modelización econométrica e imputación basada en las medianas regionales ( Wagstaff et al.,2018; capítulo 2 del informe de 2017 de la OMS y el Banco Mundial sobre el seguimiento de la cobertura sanitaria universal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Banco Mundial y la Organización Mundial de la Salud utilizan su propia agrupación regional, además de la desagregación regional propuesta para los ODS por la UNSD (por su sigla en inglés).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Métodos y lineamientos disponibles para los países para la recopilación de los datos a nivel nacional:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Garantía de calidad:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Disponibilidad de datos&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Este indicador se basa principalmente en las mismas fuentes de datos que se utilizan para supervisar el indicador 1.1.1 de los ODS, con el requisito adicional de la disponibilidad de información sobre los gastos sanitarios. Teniendo esto en cuenta, el Banco Mundial y la OMS han identificado 1.566 conjuntos de datos de encuestas de hogares potencialmente adecuados de 155 países. Algunas de estas encuestas fueron excluidas porque eran inaccesibles, carecían de las variables clave necesarias para la estimación de la proporción de la población con grandes gastos de los hogares en salud como proporción del gasto o los ingresos totales de los hogares, no pasaron el proceso de garantía de calidad o no formaban parte de una serie temporal coherente. Hasta diciembre de 2017 se han utilizado un total de 553 puntos de datos de 132 países o territorios que abarcan el periodo 1984-2015 para elaborar el indicador 3.8.2 de los ODS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La disponibilidad de datos medida en términos del número de países que la OMS y el Banco Mundial han revisado y retenido actualmente para la estimación de la &amp;#x201C;proporción de la población con grandes gastos de los hogares en salud como proporción del gasto o ingreso total de los hogares&amp;#x201D; es la siguiente para el año más reciente:.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La disponibilidad global de datos cubre al menos el 50% de todos los Estados miembros de la OMS en todas las regiones PM49, excepto los de Oceanía (7,1%). Para más información, consulte el informe de la OMS y el Banco Mundial de 2017 sobre el seguimiento de la salud universal ; Wagstaff et al 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Series temporales:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La frecuencia de estos datos es similar a la de los datos utilizados para elaborar el indicador 1.1.1 de los ODS. Varía según los países, pero en promedio, oscila entre una base anual de 1 año y 3 a 5 años.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Desagregación:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La siguiente desagregación es posible en la medida en que la encuesta ha sido diseñada para proporcionar estimaciones representativas a ese nivel:.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sexo y edad del cabeza de familia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubicación geográfica (rural/urbana)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quintiles de las medidas de bienestar del hogar (gastos o ingresos totales del hogar). Véanse los comentarios y las limitaciones para la sensibilidad de la desagregación a la elección de la medida de bienestar&lt;/li&gt;.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fuentes de discrepancias:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Las estimaciones a nivel de país se basan todas en encuestas representativas a nivel nacional con información tanto sobre el gasto o los ingresos totales de los hogares como sobre el gasto de los hogares en salud (ver fuentes de datos). En la mayoría de los casos, estos datos proceden de encuestas a hogares no normalizadas y pueden diseñarse procesos de normalización a posteriori para aumentar el grado de comparabilidad entre países. Por ejemplo, los equipos regionales del Banco Mundial producen versiones estandarizadas de conjuntos de datos brutos siguiendo procedimientos regionales comunes: los conjuntos de datos armonizados de ECAPOV (por su sigla en inglés) se basan en los conjuntos de datos del Estudio de Medición de los Niveles de Vida &amp;#x2013; LSMS (por su sigla en inglés) &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-14&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-14&quot;&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; o en las encuestas de presupuestos familiares (EPF) recopiladas en la región de Europa y Asia Central del Banco Mundial&amp;#x2019;; la colección SHIP (por su sigla en inglés) es el resultado de un programa de pobreza sobre encuestas a hogares armonizadas en la región africana del Banco Mundial&amp;#x2019;, mientras que la colección SHES (por su sigla en inglés) fue desarrollada por el Banco Mundial para el programa de comparación internacional&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-15&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-15&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Los conjuntos de datos del estudio de ingresos de Luxemburgo (LIS, por su sigla en inglés) son el resultado del esfuerzo por armonizar los conjuntos de datos de muchos países de ingresos altos y medios&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-16&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-16&quot;&gt;[16]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En algunos casos, los datos brutos son accesibles para producir estimaciones a nivel de país. En algunos países, además de los datos brutos, se dispone de una versión estandarizada de los mismos y en otros países sólo de la versión estandarizada. Cuando se dispone de varias versiones de la misma encuesta, se retiene la de mejor rendimiento en términos de una serie de pruebas de garantía de calidad (véase el proceso de recolección). Cuando se opta por una versión estandarizada de los instrumentos de una encuesta diseñada a nivel nacional, existen diferencias entre las variables de gasto generadas utilizando los datos brutos y las variables de gasto generadas utilizando los procedimientos de armonización, lo que podría dar lugar a una incidencia estimada diferente de la población con un gran gasto de los hogares en salud como proporción del gasto o los ingresos totales de los hogares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-14&quot;&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTLSMS/0,,contentMDK:21610833~pagePK:64168427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:3358997,00.html &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-14&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-15&quot;&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;p&gt; Una documentación detallada que describe los procedimientos de armonización está disponible en los documentos pdf adjuntos &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-15&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-16&quot;&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;p&gt; http://www.lisdatacenter.org/ &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-16&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Referencias&lt;/h1&gt;

			<language lang="fr">&lt;p&gt;Objectif 3 : Permettre à tous de vivre en bonne santé et promouvoir le bien-être de tous à tout âge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cible 3.8 : Faire en sorte que chacun bénéficie d’une couverture sanitaire universelle, comprenant une protection contre les risques financiers et donnant accès à des services de santé essentiels de qualité et à des médicaments et vaccins essentiels sûrs, efficaces, de qualité et à coût abordable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indicateur 3.8.2 : Proportion de la population consacrant une grande part des dépenses ou du revenu du ménage aux services de soins de santé&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2019-03-01&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indicateurs : 1.1.1; 1.2.1 et 3.8.1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organisation mondiale de la Santé (OMS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organisation mondiale de la Santé (OMS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Définition :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La proportion de la population dont le ménage consacre une part importante de ses dépenses totales ou de son revenu total aux dépenses de santé. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deux seuils sont utilisés pour définir « les dépenses de santé importantes du ménage » : supérieures à 10 % et supérieures à 25 % des dépenses ou des revenus totaux du ménage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concepts :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L’indicateur 3.8.2 est défini comme la « proportion de la population dont le ménage consacre une part importante de ses dépenses totales ou de son revenu total aux dépenses de santé ». En effet, il est basé sur un ratio dépassant un seuil. Les deux principaux concepts d’intérêt qui sous-tendent ce ratio sont les dépenses de santé du ménage (numérateur) et les dépenses totales de consommation du ménage ou, lorsqu’elles ne sont pas disponibles, le revenu (dénominateur). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Numérateur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les dépenses de santé du ménage sont définies comme toute dépense engagée au moment de l’utilisation du service pour obtenir tout type de soins (préventifs, curatifs, de réadaptation, palliatifs ou de longue durée), y compris tous les médicaments, vaccins et autres préparations pharmaceutiques ainsi que tous les produits de santé, &lt;em&gt;de tout type de fournisseur et pour tous les membres du ménage&lt;/em&gt;. Ces dépenses de santé sont caractérisées par des paiements directs qui sont financés par le revenu d’un ménage (y compris les transferts), l’épargne ou les prêts, &lt;strong&gt;mais n’incluent aucun remboursement par un tiers payeur&lt;/strong&gt;. En tant que tels, ils n’accordent l’accès qu’aux services de santé et aux produits de santé que les individus peuvent payer, sans aucune solidarité entre les personnes en bonne santé et les malades au-delà du ménage&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-2&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; et uniquement en fonction de la volonté et de la capacité du ménage de payer. Les paiements directs de soins de santé sont étiquetés paiements directs dans la classification des régimes de financement des soins de santé de la Classification internationale des comptes de la santé (ICHA). Les dépenses de santé par paiement direct sont la source de financement la plus inéquitable pour le système de santé. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les composantes des dépenses de consommation de soins de santé d’un ménage ainsi définies devraient être conformes à la division 06 sur la santé de la Classification des fonctions de consommation des ménages (COICOP) de l&apos;ONU qui comprend actuellement les dépenses en produits, appareils et matériels médicaux (06.1), les services ambulatoires (06.2) et les services hospitaliers (06.3), mais qui est en cours d’expansion&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-3&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-3&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De plus amples renseignements sur les définitions et les classifications (par exemple par fournisseur, par caractéristiques des bénéficiaires) des dépenses de santé devraient être conformes à la &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/health-accounts/methodology/en/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Classification internationale des comptes de la santé (en anglais)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; et à sa famille de classifications. L’ICHA est le fruit d’une collaboration entre l’OCDE, Eurostat et l’Organisation mondiale de la Santé. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dénominateur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les dépenses de consommation et le revenu du ménage sont toutes deux des mesures monétaires de bien-être. La consommation du ménage est fonction du revenu permanent, qui est une mesure des ressources économiques à long terme d’un ménage qui déterminent le niveau de vie. La consommation est généralement définie comme la somme des valeurs monétaires de tous les postes (biens et services) consommés par le ménage pour son propre compte au cours d’une période de référence. Il comprend les valeurs imputées des biens et services qui ne sont pas achetés mais obtenus autrement pour la consommation. L’information sur la consommation du ménage est habituellement recueillie dans le cadre d’enquêtes auprès des ménages qui peuvent utiliser différentes approches pour mesurer la « consommation » selon si les articles se réfèrent à des biens durables ou non durables et/ou sont directement produits par les ménages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La mesure la plus pertinente du revenu est le revenu disponible, car il est proche du maximum disponible pour les dépenses de consommation du ménage au cours de la période comptable. Le revenu disponible est défini comme le revenu total moins les impôts directs (nets des remboursements), les frais obligatoires et les amendes. Le revenu total est généralement composé des revenus d’emploi, des revenus de la propriété, des revenus de la production domestique de services pour l’autoconsommation, des transferts reçus en espèces et en biens, des transferts reçus en tant que services&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-4&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-4&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le revenu est plus difficile à mesurer avec précision en raison de sa plus grande variabilité au fil du temps. La consommation est moins variable dans le temps et plus facile à mesurer. Il est donc recommandé d’utiliser chaque fois qu’il y a des informations sur la consommation et le revenu des ménages (voir la section « Commentaires et limites » pour en savoir plus sur la sensibilité de 3.8.2 au choix du revenu/des dépenses au dénominateur). Les statistiques sur l&apos;indicateur 3.8.2 actuellement produites par l’OMS et la Banque mondiale reposent principalement sur la consommation (voir la section « Sources de données »). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seuils&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il est recommandé d&apos;utiliser deux seuils afin d&apos;identifier les dépenses de santé importantes du ménage en proportion des dépenses totales ou du revenu total du ménage&lt;u&gt; : &lt;/u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;un seuil inférieur de 10 % (3.8.2_10) et un seuil supérieur de 25 % (3.8.2_25)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Avec ces deux seuils l&apos;indicateur mesure les difficultés financières (voir la section « Commentaires et limites »). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-2&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/a-system-of-health-accounts/classification-of-health-care-financing-schemes-icha-hf_9789264116016-9-en&quot;&gt;(en anglais) http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/a-system-of-health-accounts/classification-of-health-care-financing-schemes-icha-hf_9789264116016-9-en&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-3&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consulter l&apos;item L.

Celles-ci sont régulièrement menées par les bureaux nationaux de statistique. Les enquêtes sur les dépenses des ménages (EDM) et les enquêtes sur le revenu et les dépenses des ménages (ERDM) les recueillent généralement car elles sont principalement menées pour fournir des intrants au calcul des indices des prix à la consommation ou à l’établissement des comptes nationaux. Une autre source potentielle d’information est l’enquête socioéconomique ou les enquêtes sur le niveau de vie; toutefois, certaines de ces enquêtes peuvent ne pas recueillir d’informations sur les dépenses totales de consommation des ménages – par exemple, lorsqu’un pays mesure la pauvreté en utilisant le revenu comme mesure de bien-être&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-5&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-5&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Le critère le plus important pour choisir une source de données pour mesurer l’indicateur 3.8.2 des ODD est la disponibilité des dépenses de consommation des ménages en matière de santé et des dépenses totales de consommation des ménages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorsque des enquêtes socio-économiques ou sur le niveau de vie sont utilisées pour mesurer l’indicateur 3.8.2 des ODD, tout défi pour la comparabilité entre pays de l’indicateur 1.1.1 des ODD s’applique également au suivi de l’indicateur 3.8.2 des ODD. Pour tout type d’enquête auprès des ménages, étant donné l’accent mis sur les dépenses de santé des ménages, il est nécessaire d’améliorer les instruments d’enquête actuels pour la comparabilité entre les pays. L’Organisation mondiale de la Santé collabore avec différentes agences des Nations Unies et d’autres parties prenantes importantes pour s’assurer que cela se produise&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-6&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-6&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-5&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf&quot;&gt;(en anglais) http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-5&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-6&quot;&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; Un exemple est l’engagement de l’OMS dans la révision en cours de COICOP par la DSNU &lt;a href=&quot;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/class/revisions/coicop_revision.asp&quot;&gt;(en anglais) https://unstats.un.org/unsd/class/revisions/coicop_revision.asp&lt;/a&gt;. Un autre exemple est un projet du BMGF que l’OMS soutient pour améliorer la mesure des dépenses de santé des ménages &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indepth-network.org/projects/ihope&quot;&gt;(en anglais) http://www.indepth-network.org/projects/ihope&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-6&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;L’OMS obtient des données d’enquête auprès des ménages auprès des bureaux nationaux de statistique où le dénominateur et le numérateur du ratio des dépenses de santé sont construits en suivant leurs propres lignes directrices, soit directement par eux, soit par des consultants de l’OMS. L’OMS travaille, par l’intermédiaire de ses bureaux régionaux ou de ses bureaux nationaux, pour obtenir l’accès aux données. Aucun ajustement systématique n’est entrepris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Banque mondiale reçoit également généralement des données des bureaux nationaux de statistique (BNS) directement. Dans d’autres cas, elle utilise les données du BNS reçues indirectement. Par exemple, elle reçoit des données d’Eurostat et du LIS (« Luxembourg Income Study »), qui fournissent les données des bureaux nationaux de la Banque mondiale qu’ils ont reçues / harmonisées. L’Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentine et la Banque mondiale tiennent à jour conjointement la base de données SEDLAC (Base de données socio-économiques pour l’Amérique latine et les Caraïbes) qui comprend des statistiques harmonisées sur la pauvreté et d’autres variables distributives et sociales de 24 pays d’Amérique latine et des Caraïbes, sur la base de microdonnées provenant d’enquêtes auprès des ménages menées par les BNS. Les données sont obtenues dans le cadre de programmes propres à chaque pays, y compris des programmes d’assistance technique et des activités conjointes d’analyse et de renforcement des capacités. La Banque mondiale entretient des relations avec les BNS dans le cadre de programmes de travail impliquant des systèmes statistiques et l’analyse de données. Les économistes de la pauvreté de la Banque mondiale s’engagent généralement avec les BNS sur la mesure et l’analyse de la pauvreté dans le cadre des activités d’assistance technique. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L’Organisation mondiale de la Santé et la Banque mondiale génèrent l’indicateur 3.8.2 selon la même approche (voir méthodologie). Les deux institutions combinent des estimations au niveau intermédiaire (méso). L’éligibilité des estimations incluses dans une base de données mondiale commune pour la production d’estimations régionales et mondiales est basée sur les contrôles de qualité suivants :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Pour le dénominateur du ratio des dépenses de santé&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Comparer le logarithme de la consommation totale par habitant dans une source
de référence avec le logarithme de la consommation totale par habitant estimée à partir de l’enquête. Les deux sont exprimés sur une base mensuelle en dollars internationaux (PPA) de 2011. La source de référence est tirée de Povcalnet&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-7&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-7&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; si disponible, et sinon des Indicateurs de développement mondial (IDM)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-8&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-8&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, calculés comme les dépenses de consommation finale des ménages en dollars internationaux 2011 constants divisés par la population totale. Lorsque la différence entre le logarithme de la consommation totale par habitant dans la source de référence et le logarithme de la valeur estimée à partir de l’enquête (exprimée en pourcentage du premier) est supérieure à 10 % lorsque la comparaison est avec PovcalNet et supérieure à 15 % lorsque la comparaison est faite avec les IDM, l&apos;estimation de l’enquête est identifiée comme une valeur aberrante au niveau international en termes de consommation par habitant. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Comparer l’effectif de pauvreté estimé à partir de l’enquête (avec le seuil
de pauvreté de 1,90 $ par jour, PPA de 2011) avec l’incidence de la pauvreté signalée dans PovcalNet avec le même seuil de pauvreté (valeur de référence). Lorsque la différence absolue entre la valeur de référence et l’estimation de l’enquête dépasse 10 points de pourcentage, l&apos;estimation de l’enquête est identifiée comme une valeur aberrante dans l’incidence de l’extrême pauvreté et signalée pour une éventuelle exclusion. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Comparer l’effectif de pauvreté estimé à partir de l’enquête (avec le seuil
de pauvreté de 3,10 $ par jour, PPA de 2011) avec l’incidence de la pauvreté rapportée dans PovcalNet avec le même seuil de pauvreté (valeur de référence). Lorsque la différence absolue entre la valeur de référence et l’estimation de l’enquête dépasse 10 points de pourcentage, l&apos;estimation de l’enquête est identifiée comme une valeur aberrante dans l’effectif de pauvreté à 3,10 $ par jour et signalée pour une éventuelle exclusion. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Pour le numérateur du ratio des dépenses de santé&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Comparer le ratio moyen des dépenses de santé dans l’enquête à un ratio moyen
du budget de référence construit comme le rapport entre la mesure agrégée des dépenses directes (« out-of-pocket ») des ménages et les dépenses aggrégées de consommation finale des ménages, toutes deux en monnaie locale courante. Lorsque la différence absolue dépasse 5 points de pourcentage, l&apos;estimation de l’enquête est identifiée comme une valeur aberrante en termes de part du budget des ménages consacrée à la santé et signalée pour une éventuelle exclusion. Le macro-indicateur des dépenses personnelles des ménages est disponible à partir de la &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/health-accounts/ghed/en/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;(en anglais) Global Health Expenditure Database&lt;/u&gt;(GHED)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-9&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-9&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; et de la &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;(en anglais) World Development Indicators Database&lt;/u&gt;(WDI)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-10&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-10&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Les informations sur la dépense de consommation finale des ménages sont également extraites des IDM (code de la série : NE.CON.PRVT.CN). &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ces repères sont également utilisés pour décider entre deux estimations pour les pays et les années pour lesquelles les deux institutions ont la même source de données. Pour plus d&apos;information, veuillez consulter le Rapport mondial de suivi 2017 : la couverture-santé universelle de l&apos;OMS et la Banque internationale pour la reconstruction et le développement/ La Banque mondiale, ainsi que Wagstaff et al 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;À la fin du processus d&apos;assurance qualité, l&apos;OMS et la Banque mondiale assemblent des estimations non dupliquées de la proportion de la population dont le ménage a d&apos;importantes dépenses de santé en pourcentage des dépenses ou des revenus totaux du ménage, pour chaque pays. L&apos;Organisation mondiale de la Santé entreprend alors un processus de consultation des pays. Suite à une résolution du Conseil exécutif de l&apos;OMS (EB107.R8), l&apos;OMS est priée de le faire avant de publier des estimations au niveau national au nom des États membres. Pour tout indicateur donné, ce processus commence par l&apos;envoi par l&apos;OMS d&apos;une demande officielle aux ministères de la santé pour désigner un point focal pour la consultation sur l&apos;indicateur. Une fois que les États membres ont nommé des points focaux, l&apos;OMS leur envoie alors des estimations provisoires et des descriptions méthodologiques. Le code de programmation STATA est disponible pour reproduire les estimations partagées. Les points focaux envoient ensuite à l&apos;OMS leurs commentaires, y compris souvent de nouvelles données ou des estimations nationales révisées qui sont utilisées pour mettre à jour les estimations nationales. Lors de la consultation des pays de 2017, 137 États membres de l&apos;OMS ont désigné des points focaux, 100 d&apos;entre eux ont reçu des estimations provisoires et des informations sur la méthodologie; 37 n&apos;ont reçu que des informations sur la méthodologie car aucune estimation n&apos;a été produite. Sur les 57 États membres de l&apos;OMS sans points focaux désignés, des estimations sont disponibles pour 32 d&apos;entre eux. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En plus de ces consultations, l&apos;Organisation mondiale de la Santé et la Banque mondiale organisent régulièrement des formations sur la mesure de l&apos;absence de couverture de protection financière, auxquelles participent des gens du ministère de la santé ainsi que du bureau national de statistique. L&apos;OMS a plusieurs collaborations régionales et nationales en cours pour soutenir la production de l&apos;indicateur 3.8.2 car il a été récemment adopté et il n&apos;est pas encore produit systématiquement par le bureau national de statistique malgré la disponibilité des données et la simplicité de la méthodologie. Les résultats de ces collaborations ne sont pas encore inclus dans la base de données constituée par l&apos;OMS et la Banque mondiale, mais les estimations produites par un pays seront soumises au même processus d&apos;assurance qualité que nous venons de décrire. &lt;/p&gt;

À l’avenir, de nouvelles données seront ajoutées au fur et à mesure que de plus amples renseignements seront reçus des points focaux désignés (voir le processus de collecte). Des mises à jour des estimations régionales et mondiales sont prévues tous les deux ans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bureaux nationaux de statistique en collaboration avec les ministères de la santé. Voir la section « Sources de données » pour plus de détails. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L&apos;OMS et la Banque mondiale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L’objectif 3.8 est défini comme « Faire en sorte que chacun bénéficie d’une couverture sanitaire universelle, comprenant une protection contre les risques financiers et donnant accès à des services de santé essentiels de qualité et à des médicaments et vaccins essentiels sûrs, efficaces, de qualité et à coût abordable ». La préoccupation est liée au fait que toutes les personnes et toutes les communautés doivent recevoir les services de santé de qualité dont elles ont besoin (y compris les médicaments et autres produits de santé), sans difficultés financières. Deux indicateurs ont été choisis pour surveiller l’objectif 3.8 dans le cadre des ODD. L’indicateur 3.8.1 porte sur la couverture des services de santé et l’indicateur 3.8.2 met l’accent sur les dépenses de santé par rapport au budget d’un ménage afin d’identifier les difficultés financières causées par les paiements directs de soins de santé. Pris dans leur ensemble, les indicateurs 3.8.1 et 3.8.2 visent à saisir les dimensions de la couverture des services et de la protection financière, respectivement, de l’objectif 3.8. Ces deux indicateurs doivent toujours être surveillés conjointement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L’indicateur 3.8.2 découle de méthodologies datant des années 1990 élaborées en collaboration avec des universitaires de la Banque mondiale et de l’Organisation mondiale de la Santé. L’indicateur 3.8.2 vise à identifier les personnes qui doivent consacrer une part substantielle des dépenses ou des revenus totaux de leur ménage aux soins de santé. L’accent est mis sur les paiements effectués au point de service pour obtenir tout type de traitement, de tout type de fournisseur, pour tout type de maladie ou de problème de santé, nets de tout remboursement à la personne qui a effectué le paiement, mais à l’exclusion des paiements anticipés pour les services de santé; par exemple, sous forme d’impôts ou de primes ou de cotisations d’assurance spécifiques. Ces paiements directs sont le moyen le moins équitable de financer les systèmes de santé étant donné qu’ils déterminent l’étendue des soins reçus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cela va clairement à l’encontre de l’esprit de la cible, qui demande à favorise l’accès en fonction des besoins de santé et non de la capacité d’un ménage à rassembler toutes ses ressources financières pour répondre aux besoins de santé de ses membres. Certains paiements directs pourraient être nécessaires, mais l’indicateur 3.8.2 est étayé par la conviction que personne, quel que soit le niveau de revenu, ne devrait avoir à choisir entre les dépenses de santé et les dépenses pour d’autres biens et services de base tels que les frais de scolarité, les nécessités alimentaires, le logement et les services publics. Une façon d’évaluer dans quelle mesure les systèmes de santé entraînent des difficultés financières consiste à calculer la proportion de la population dont le ménage a d&apos;importantes dépenses de santé en proportion de ses dépenses ou de ses revenus totaux. Pour des informations détaillées sur la définition choisie pour surveiller la dimension de protection financière de la couverture sanitaire universelle dans le cadre de suivi des ODD (indicateur 3.8.2), veuillez consulter Wagstaff et al. (2018) et le chapitre 2 du Rapport mondial de suivi 2017 : la couverture-santé universelle de l&apos;OMS et la Banque internationale pour la reconstruction et le développement/ La Banque mondiale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Il est possible de suivre l&apos;indicateur 3.8.2 de manière régulière en utilisant les mêmes données d&apos;enquête auprès des ménages que celles utilisées pour suivre les cibles 1.1 et 1.2, liées à la pauvreté&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-11&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-11&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Ces enquêtes sont généralement menées par les bureaux nationaux de statistique (BNS) et ce à d&apos;autres fins, telles que le calcul des pondérations de l&apos;indice des prix à la consommation. Ainsi, le suivi de la proportion de la population dont les dépenses de santé des ménages sont importantes par rapport à la consommation totale ou au revenu total de leur ménage n&apos;ajoute pas de fardeau supplémentaire en matière de collecte de données, à condition que la composante &quot;dépenses de santé&quot; puisse être identifiée. Bien que cela constitue un avantage, l&apos;indicateur 3.8.2 souffre des mêmes problèmes d&apos;actualité, de fréquence, de qualité des données et de comparabilité que l&apos;indicateur 1.1.1. Toutefois, l&apos;indicateur 3.8.2 a également ses propres limites conceptuelles et empiriques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premièrement, l&apos;indicateur 3.8.2 tente d&apos;identifier les difficultés financières auxquelles les individus sont confrontés lorsqu&apos;ils utilisent leurs revenus, leurs économies ou contractent des prêts pour payer leurs soins de santé. Cependant, la plupart des enquêtes auprès des ménages ne parviennent pas à identifier la source de financement utilisée par les ménages. Dans les pays où il n&apos;existe pas de remboursement rétroactif des dépenses de santé des ménages, cela ne pose pas de problème. Si un ménage déclare une dépense de santé, c&apos;est parce qu&apos;elle ne sera pas remboursée par une tierce partie. Le tout est donc conforme à la définition utilisée pour les paiements directs de soins de santé (le numérateur). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pour les pays où il existe un remboursement rétroactif, par exemple via un régime d&apos;assurance maladie contributif, le montant déclaré par un ménage pour les dépenses de santé peut être totalement ou partiellement remboursé à un moment ultérieur, parfois hors de la période de référence de l&apos;enquête. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Du travail supplémentaire sera nécessaire afin d&apos;assurer que les instruments d&apos;enquête recueillent des informations sur les sources de financement utilisées par le ménage pour payer les soins de santé, ou que les instruments d&apos;enquête auprès des ménages précisent toujours que les dépenses de santé doivent être nettes de tout remboursement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuxièmement, selon la définition actuelle de l&apos;indicateur 3.8.2, les dépenses de santé importantes peuvent être identifiées en fonction du revenu ou des dépenses totales des ménages. Il est généralement recommandé d&apos;utiliser les dépenses pour mesurer les ressources des ménages (voir la section Concepts). Des travaux empiriques récents ont toutefois démontré que si les statistiques nationales pour l&apos;indicateur 3.8.2 sont assez robustes lorsqu&apos;on utilise les dépenses, on observe une certaine volatilité si l&apos;on regarde le tout par groupe de revenu. Les mesures basées sur le revenu montrent une plus grande concentration de la proportion de la population ayant d&apos;importantes dépenses de santé parmi les ménages plus pauvres que les mesures basées sur les dépenses (voir le chapitre 2 du Rapport mondial de suivi 2017 : la couverture-santé universelle de l&apos;OMS et de la Banque mondiale ainsi que Wagstaff et al 2018).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troisièmement, l&apos;indicateur 3.8.2 s&apos;appuie sur des seuils pour identifier ce qui constitue &amp;#x2018;les dépenses de santé importantes en tant que part des dépenses ou revenus totaux des ménages&amp;#x2019;. Les personnes se situant juste en dessous de ces seuils ne sont pas prises en compte, ce qui est toujours le problème avec les mesures basées sur des seuils. On peut éviter simplement ce problème en calculant la distribution cumulative du ratio des dépenses de santé en fonction des dépenses totales ou du revenu total du ménage. Ainsi, il serait même possible d&apos;identifier pour n&apos;importe quel seuil la proportion de la population consacrant une part quelconque du budget de son ménage à la santé. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quatrièmement, l&apos;indicateur 3.8.2 est basé sur des mesures des dépenses de santé ex-post. De faibles niveaux de dépenses pourraient être attribuables à des erreurs de mesure dues à l&apos;échantillonnage, telles qu&apos;une période de référence trop courte qui ne permettrait pas la collecte d&apos;informations sur les soins de santé nécessitant une nuitée, ou à des erreurs d&apos;échantillonnage telles qu&apos;un suréchantillonnage de régions où la morbidité est particulièrement faible. L&apos;absence de dépenses pourrait également être due au fait que les gens ne peuvent rien dépenser pour la santé, ce qui, au moins pour les services qui sont inclus à l&apos;indicateur 3.8.1, devrait se traduire par de faibles niveaux de couverture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il existe d&apos;autres indicateurs utilisés pour mesurer les difficultés financières. Par exemple, l&apos;OMS utilise un cadre qui comprend, en plus de l&apos;indicateur 3.8.2, une définition des grandes dépenses de santé par rapport aux dépenses de non-subsistance&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-5&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-6&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-7&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-7&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf&quot;&gt;http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/math&gt; est un seuil identifiant les dépenses importantes des ménages en matière
de santé en tant que part de la consommation ou du revenu total (par ex. 10 % et 25 %). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Les dépenses de santé et totales et les revenus totaux des ménages sont définis à la section Concepts. Pour plus d&apos;informations sur la méthodologie, il est possible de consulter Wagstaff et al (2018) et le chapitre 2 du Rapport mondial de suivi 2017 : la couverture-santé universelle de l&apos;OMS et la Banque internationale pour la reconstruction et le développement/ La Banque mondiale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traitement des valeurs manquantes :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Au niveau national, il n&apos;y a pas d&apos;imputation. L&apos;indicateur est estimé pour toutes les années pour lesquelles une enquête représentative au niveau national (par ex. les enquêtes sur le budget des ménages, les revenus et dépenses des ménages, les conditions socio-économiques ou les niveaux de vie) est disponible et inclut de l&apos;information à la fois sur les dépenses ou les revenus du ménage et sur les dépenses de santé du ménage. Lorsqu&apos;il y a plusieurs enquêtes disponibles pour un même pays, une préférence est accordée aux estimations provenant de la même enquête. Une série de tests est effectuée pour sélectionner les meilleures séries de données (voir la section « Processus de collecte »).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorsque les données d&apos;enquête ne sont pas disponibles pour les années de référence 2000, 2005 ou 2010, les estimations pour les années intermédiaires pour chaque période de 5 ans sont « ajustées » en utilisant une combinaison d&apos;interpolation, d&apos;extrapolation, de modélisation économétrique et d&apos;imputation basée sur les médianes régionales (Wagstaff et al.,2018; chapitre 2 du Rapport mondial de suivi 2017 : la couverture-santé universelle de l&apos;OMS et la Banque internationale pour la reconstruction et le développement/ La Banque mondiale).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Banque mondiale et l&apos;OMS utilisent leurs propres groupements régionaux, en plus de la ventilation régionale proposée pour les ODD par la Division de la statistique des Nations Unies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Méthodes et instructions à la disposition des pays pour la compilation des données au niveau national :&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Assurance de la qualité :&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disponibilité des données :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cet indicateur repose principalement sur les mêmes sources de données que celles utilisées pour le suivi de l&apos;indicateur 1.1.1, à l&apos;exception que les données sur les dépenses de santé sont également nécessaires. La Banque mondiale et l&apos;OMS ont identifié 1 566 ensembles de données d&apos;enquêtes auprès des ménages potentiellement appropriés et ce, pour 155 pays. Certaines de ces enquêtes ont été exclues parce qu&apos;elles sont soit inaccessibles, soit dépourvues des variables clés nécessaires à l&apos;estimation de l&apos;indicateur, soit parce qu&apos;elles n&apos;ont pas passé le processus d&apos;assurance de la qualité ou soit parce qu&apos;elles ne faisaient pas partie d&apos;une série chronologique cohérente. En décembre 2017, un total de 553 points de données provenant de 132 pays ou territoires et couvrant la période 1984 à 2015 ont été utilisés pour produire des données pour cet indicateur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La disponibilité des données, mesurée en termes de nombre de pays que l&apos;OMS et la Banque mondiale ont actuellement examinés et retenus pour l&apos;estimation de la « proportion de la population dont le ménage consacre une part importante de ses dépenses totales ou de son revenu total aux dépenses de santé » est la suivante pour l&apos;année la plus récente :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globalement les données couvrent au moins 50 % des États membres de l&apos;OMS dans toutes les régions, sauf pour l&apos;Océanie (7,1 %). Pour plus d&apos;information, il est possible de consulter le Rapport mondial de suivi 2017 : la couverture-santé universelle de l&apos;OMS et la Banque internationale pour la reconstruction et le développement/ La Banque mondiale et Wagstaff et al 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Séries chronologiques :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La fréquence de ces données est similaire à celle des données utilisées pour l&apos;indicateur 1.1.1. Elle varie d&apos;un pays à l&apos;autre, mais en moyenne, elle va de 1 an à 3 à 5 ans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Désagrégation :&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les désagrégations suivantes sont possibles dans la mesure où l&apos;enquête a été conçue pour fournir des estimations représentatives à ce niveau :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genre et âge du chef du ménage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emplacement géographique (rurale/urbaine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quintiles du bien-être du ménage (dépenses totales ou revenu total). Voir la section Commentaires et limites pour les impacts de choisir l&apos;une ou l&apos;autre de ces mesures de bien-être.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources des divergences :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les estimations au niveau des pays sont toutes fondées sur des enquêtes représentatives au niveau national avec des informations sur les dépenses ou les revenus totaux des ménages et sur les dépenses de santé des ménages (voir la section « Sources de données »). Dans la plupart des cas, ces données proviennent d’enquêtes non standard auprès des ménages et les processus de normalisation ex post peuvent être conçus pour accroître le degré de comparabilité entre les pays. Par exemple, les équipes régionales de la Banque mondiale produisent des versions normalisées des ensembles de données brutes selon des procédures régionales communes : les ensembles de données harmonisés de l’ECAPOV sont basés sur les ensembles de données de l’Étude sur la mesure du niveau de vie – LSMS&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-15&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-15&quot;&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ou sur les enquêtes sur les dépenses des ménages (EDM) recueillies dans la région Europe et Asie centrale de la Banque mondiale; la collecte du SHIP résulte d’un programme de lutte contre la pauvreté sur les enquêtes harmonisées auprès des ménages dans la région africaine de la Banque mondiale, tandis que la collecte du SHES a été développée par la Banque mondiale pour le programme de comparaison internationale&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-16&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-16&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. La base de données du « Luxembourg Income Study » (LIS) résulte des efforts visant à harmoniser les ensembles de données de nombreux pays à revenu élevé et moyen&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-17&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-17&quot;&gt;[16]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dans certains cas, les données brutes sont accessibles pour produire des estimations au niveau des pays. Dans certains pays, en plus des données brutes, une version normalisée de celles-ci est disponible et dans d’autres pays, seule la version normalisée l’est. Lorsque plusieurs versions d’une même enquête sont disponibles, les plus performantes en termes de série de tests d’assurance de la qualité sont conservées (voir processus de collecte). Lorsqu’une version normalisée d’un instrument d’enquête conçu à l’échelle nationale est choisie, il existe des différences entre les variables de dépenses générées à l’aide des données brutes et les variables de dépenses générées à l’aide des procédures d’harmonisation, ce qui pourrait entraîner une incidence estimée différente de la population dont le ménage consacre une part importante de ses dépenses totales ou de son revenu total aux dépenses de santé. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-15&quot;&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; (en anglais) http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTLSMS/0,,contentMDK:21610833~pagePK:64168427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:3358997,00.html &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-15&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-16&quot;&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; Une documentation détaillée décrivant les procédures d’harmonisation est disponible dans les documents PDF ci-joints &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-16&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-17&quot;&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; (en anglais) http://www.lisdatacenter.org/ &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-17&quot;&gt; &amp;#x2191; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;(À moins d&apos;indication contraire, les références sont en anglais)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Всемирная организация здравоохранения (ВОЗ)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Понятия и определения&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Определение:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Доля населения с большим удельным весом семейных расходов на медицинскую помощь в общем объеме расходов или доходов домохозяйств. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Для определения большого удельного веса семейных расходов на медицинскую помощь используются два порога: более 10% и более 25% от общих расходов или доходов домохозяйства.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Понятия:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Показатель 3.8.2 определяется как доля населения с большим удельным весом семейных расходов на медицинскую помощь в общем объеме расходов или доходов домохозяйств. Фактически он представляет собой коэффициент, величина которого превышает пороговое значение. Два основных понятия, входящие в это соотношение, - это расходы домохозяйств на здравоохранение (числитель) и общие расходы домохозяйств на потребление или, если эти данные отсутствуют, доход (знаменатель). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Числитель&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Расходы домохозяйства на здравоохранение определяются как любые расходы, понесенные во время использования услуги, для получения любого вида ухода (стимулирующего, профилактического, лечебного, реабилитационного, паллиативного или долгосрочного ухода), включая все лекарства, вакцины и другие фармацевтические препараты, а также все товары медицинского назначения от любого поставщика и для всех членов семьи. Эти расходы на здравоохранение характеризуются прямыми платежами, которые совершаются за счет дохода домохозяйства (включая денежные переводы), сбережений или займов, но не включают возмещение, совершенное третьей стороной. Таким образом эти расходы предоставляют доступ к медицинским услугам и продуктам здравоохранения, за которые могут платить только люди как частные лица, без какого-либо взаимодействия между больными и здоровыми, находящимися вне домохозяйства, и исключительно на основе готовности и способности домохозяйства оплачивать эти расходы. Прямые платежи за услуги здравоохранения называются расходами, оплаченными из собственных средств (Out-Of-Pocket - OOP) в схемах классификации финансирования здравоохранения (HF) Международной классификации для счетов здравоохранения (МКСЗ). Платежи из собственных средств за услуги здравоохранения являются источником наибольшей несправедливости, связанной с системой оплаты услуг здравоохранения. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Определенные таким образом компоненты расходов на здравоохранение в домашних хозяйствах должны соответствовать разделу 06 &quot;Здравоохранение&quot; Классификации индивидуального потребления ООН по целям (КИПЦ-COICOP), который в настоящее время включает расходы на медикаменты, лечебное оборудование и аппаратуру (06.1), амбулаторные услуги (06.2 ) и услуги больниц (06.3), но продолжает расширяться.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Дополнительная информация об определениях и классификациях (например, по поставщикам, по характеристикам бенефициаров) расходов на здравоохранение должна соответствовать Международной классификации для счетов здравоохранения (МКСЗ) и ее семейству классификаций. МКСЗ является результатом сотрудничества между ОЭСР, Евростатом и Всемирной организацией здравоохранения. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Знаменатель&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Расходы на потребление домохозяйства и доход домохозяйства являются мерами благосостояния, выраженными в денежной форме. Потребление домохозяйств - это функция постоянного дохода, который является мерой долгосрочных экономических ресурсов домохозяйства, определяющих уровень жизни. Потребление обычно определяется как сумма стоимостей всех элементов (товаров и услуг), потребленных домохозяйством на внутреннем рынке в течение отчетного периода. Потребление включает вмененную стоимость товаров и услуг, которые не были приобретены, но получены иным образом для целей потребления. Информация о потреблении домашних хозяйств обычно собирается при проведении обследований домашних хозяйств, в которых могут использоваться различные подходы для оценки потребления в зависимости от того, относятся ли позиции к товарам длительного или недлительного пользования и / или производятся ли они непосредственно домашними хозяйствами.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Наиболее показательной оценкой дохода является располагаемый доход, поскольку он близок к максимальному ресурсу, которым располагает домашнее хозяйство для оплаты потребительских расходов в течение отчетного периода. Располагаемый доход определяется как общий доход за вычетом прямых налогов (исключая возвратные денежные средства), обязательных платежей и штрафов. Общий доход обычно состоит из дохода от работы по найму, дохода от собственности, дохода от производства услуг домохозяйствами для собственного потребления, трансфертов, полученных в денежной форме и в виде товаров, трансфертов, полученных в виде услуг. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Доход более сложно оценить точно из-за его большей изменчивости с течением времени. Потребление менее изменчиво во времени и его легче оценить. Поэтому рекомендуется в случае наличия информации о потреблении и о доходах домашних хозяйств использовать информацию о потреблении (см. Раздел «Комментарии и ограничения», чтобы узнать больше о чувствительности показателя 3.8.2 к выбору информации о доходах / расходах для использования ее в знаменателе). Статистическая информация по показателю 3.8.2, который в настоящее время разрабатывается Всемирной организацией здравоохранения и Всемирным банком, преимущественно основывается на данных по потреблению (см. Раздел об источниках данных). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Пороговые значения&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Рекомендуется использовать два пороговых значения для глобальной отчетности, чтобы определить большой удельный вес семейных расходов на медицинскую помощь в общем объеме расходов или доходов домохозяйств: нижний порог составляет 10% (3.8.2_10), а более высокий порог составляет 25% (3.8.2_25). Эти два пороговых значения показателя определяют наличие финансовых затруднений при оплате расходов на медицинскую помощь. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ((см. Раздел «Комментарии и ограничения»). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Описание:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Рекомендуемыми источниками данных для мониторинга &quot;доли населения с большим удельным весом семейных расходов на медицинскую помощь в общем объеме расходов или доходов&quot; домохозяйств являются обследования домохозяйств, проводимые национальными статистическими управлениями на регулярной основе и включающие информацию как о расходах домохозяйств на здравоохранение, так и общих потребительских расходах домохозяйств. Обследования бюджетов домашних хозяйств (ОБДХ) и обследования доходов и расходов домашних хозяйств (ОДРДХ) обычно собирают такую информацию, поскольку они в основном проводятся с целью получения исходных данных для расчета индексов потребительских цен или составления национальных счетов. Другим потенциальным источником информации являются социально-экономические исследования или обследования уровня жизни; однако в рамках некоторых из этих обследований может не собираться информация об общих потребительских расходах домохозяйств, например, когда в стране уровень бедности оценивается с использованием дохода в качестве меры благосостояния. Наиболее важным критерием выбора источника данных для оценки показателя 3.8.2 ЦУР является наличие информации как о потребительских расходах домашних хозяйств на здравоохранение, так и общих потребительских расходах домашних хозяйств.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Когда для оценки показателя 3.8.2 ЦУР используются данные социально-экономических исследований или обследования уровня жизни, то все проблемы обеспечения сопоставимости показателя 1.1.1 ЦУР по разным странам также становятся присущи процессам проведении мониторинга показателя 3.8.2 ЦУР. Для любого типа обследования домашних хозяйств, фокусирующего внимание на расходах домашних хозяйств на здравоохранение, необходимо совершенствовать существующие инструментарии обследования для обеспечения сопоставимости между странами. Всемирная организация здравоохранения сотрудничает с различными учреждениями ООН и другими важными заинтересованными сторонами для обеспечения того, чтобы запустить этот процесс. Одним из примеров является участие ВОЗ в постоянном пересмотре КИПЦ-COICOP, проводимом Статистическим отделом ООН. Другим примером является проект Фонда Билла и Мелинды Гейтс (BMGF), который ВОЗ поддерживает для совершенствования механизма оценки расходов домашних хозяйств на здравоохранение.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Процесс сбора:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ВОЗ получает данные обследований домохозяйств от национальных статистических управлений, в которых знаменатель и числитель формулы для расчета доли расходов на здравоохранение составлены в соответствии с их собственными руководящими принципами, либо непосредственно ими, либо консультантами ВОЗ. ВОЗ работает через свои региональные бюро или страновые бюро для получения доступа к данным. Никаких систематических корректировок не проводится. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Всемирный банк (ВБ) обычно получает данные от национальных статистических управлений (НСУ) напрямую. Но в некоторых случаях используются данные НСУ, получаемые косвенным путем. Например, Евростат и LIS (Люксембургское исследование доходов), получив от НСУ данные и гармонизовав их, затем предоставляют эти данные Всемирному банку. Национальный университет Ла-Платы, Аргентина и Всемирный банк совместно поддерживают базу данных SEDLAC (Социально-экономическая база данных для стран Латинской Америки и Карибского бассейна), которая включает в себя согласованные статистические данные по бедности и другие обобщенные и социальные переменные по 24 странам Латинской Америки и Карибского бассейна, основанные на микроданных, полученных при проведении обследований домашних хозяйств, организуемых национальными статистическими управлениями. Данные получаются посредством реализации конкретных страновых программ, включающих программы технической помощи и совместные аналитические мероприятия, а также мероприятий по наращиванию потенциала. Всемирный банк сотрудничает с национальными статистическими управлениями на основе рабочих программ, включающих статистические системы и анализ данных. Экономисты Всемирного банка, занимающиеся вопросами бедности, обычно взаимодействуют с экспертами национальных статистических управлений по широкому кругу вопросов оценки и анализа бедности в рамках деятельности по оказанию технической помощи. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Всемирная организация здравоохранения и Всемирный банк разрабатывают показатель 3.8.2, следуя тому же принципу (см. Методологию). Обе организации объединяют оценки на мезоуровне. Правомочность оценок, включенных в общую глобальную базу данных для составления региональных и глобальных оценок, основана на следующих проверках качества: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Применительно к знаменателю формулы для расчета доли расходов на здравоохранение&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Сравнивается логарифм общего потребления на душу населения в эталонном источнике
с логарифмом общего потребления на душу населения, оцененным по результатам обследования. Оба показателя рассчитываются ежемесячно по ППС в международных долларах в ценах 2011 года. Эталонный источник берется из Povcalnet, если таковой имеется, и из Показателей мирового развития (ПМР), рассчитанных как расходы домохозяйств на конечное потребление в международных долларах в постоянных ценах 2011 года, поделенных на общую численность населения. Если разница между логарифмом общего потребления на душу населения в эталонном источнике и логарифмом величины, оцененной по результатам обследования как доля логарифма общего потребления на душу населения в эталонном источнике, превышает 10% при сравнении с данными из PovcalNet и более 15%, когда проводится сравнение с данными из ПМР, то значение в точке обследования отождествляется как выброс по отношению к международному уровню потребления на душу населения. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Сравнивается численность бедного населения, оцененная по результатам обследования
на уровне черты бедности в 1,90 долл. США в день по ППС в ценах 2011 года, с распространенностью бедности, зарегистрированной в PovcalNet, на уровне той же черты бедности (эталонное значение). Если абсолютная разница между эталонным значением и оценкой обследования превышает 10 процентных пунктов, то значение в точке обследования идентифицируется как выброс в распространенности крайней нищеты и помечается для возможного исключения. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Сравнивается численность бедного населения, оцененная по результатам обследования
на уровне черты бедности в 3,10 долл. США в день по ППС в ценах 2011 года, с распространенностью бедности, зарегистрированной в PovcalNet, на уровне той же черты бедности (эталонное значение). Если абсолютная разница между эталонным значением и оценкой обследования превышает 10 процентных пунктов, то значение в точке обследования идентифицируется как выброс в численности бедных на уровне черты бедности в 3,10 долл. США в день и помечается для возможного исключения.&lt;li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Применительно к числителю формулы для расчета доли расходов на здравоохранение&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Сравнивается средний коэффициент расходов на здравоохранение в обследовании
с эталонной средней долей бюджета, построенной как отношение совокупного показателя расходов, оплаченных из собственных средств домохозяйств, в текущих ценах в местной валюте и совокупных расходов конечного потребления домохозяйств в текущих ценах в местной валюте. Если абсолютная разница превышает 5 процентных пунктов, то значение в точке обследования идентифицируется как выброс с точки зрения доли бюджета домохозяйства, расходуемой на здравоохранение, и помечается для возможного исключения. Макропоказатель наличных расходов домашних хозяйств доступен по адресу &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/health-accounts/ghed/en/&quot;&gt;Global Health Expenditure Database&lt;/a&gt; (GHED)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-8&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-8&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators&quot;&gt;World Development Indicators Database&lt;/a&gt; (WDI)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-9&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-9&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Информация о расходах домохозяйств на конечное потребление также взята из ПМР (код серии: NE.CON.PRVT.CN).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Эти эталонные показатели также используются для выбора между двумя оценками для этих стран и теми годами, за которые обе организации имеют один и тот же источник данных. Для получения дополнительной информации см. доклад ВОЗ и Всемирного банка об отслеживании всеобщего охвата медико-санитарными услугами за 2017 год, а также доклад Wagstaff и др. за 2018 год. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;В конце процесса обеспечения качества данных ВОЗ и Всемирный банк собирают не дублирующие друг друга оценки доли населения с большим удельным весом семейных расходов на медицинскую помощь в общем объеме расходов или доходов домохозяйств для каждой страны. Затем Всемирная организация здравоохранения проводит процесс страновых консультаций. В соответствии с резолюцией Исполнительного комитета ВОЗ (EB107.R8) Всемирной организации здравоохранения предлагается проводить процесс страновых консультаций с государствами-членами до публикации оценок. Для любого данного показателя этот процесс начинается с того, что ВОЗ направляет официальный запрос министерствам здравоохранения о назначении ими координатора для консультаций по данному показателю. После того, как государства-члены назначают координаторов, ВОЗ направляет им проекты смет и методологические описания. Коды STATA доступны для производства общих оценок. Затем координаторы направляют в ВОЗ свои комментарии, часто содержащие новые данные или пересмотренные страновые оценки, которые используются для обновления страновых оценок. В ходе страновых консультаций 2017 года 137 государств-членов ВОЗ назначили координаторов, 100 из них получили проекты смет и информацию о методологии; 37 получили только информацию о методологии, так как проект сметы не был подготовлен. Из 57 государств-членов ВОЗ без назначенных координаторов имеются оценки для 32 из этих стран.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;В дополнение к таким консультациям Всемирная организация здравоохранения и Всемирный банк регулярно проводят учебные мероприятия по оценке недостаточности охвата финансовой защитой, в которых принимают участие представители Министерства здравоохранения, а также Национального статистического управления. ВОЗ поддерживает несколько региональных и национальных программ сотрудничества в поддержку разработки показателя 3.8.2, но так как он был принят недавно, то Национальное статистическое управление пока не осуществляет его разработку на регулярной основе, несмотря на имеющиеся данные и простую методологию. Результаты такого сотрудничества еще не включены в базу данных, собранных ВОЗ и Всемирным банком, однако оценки, подготовленные страной, будут подвергаться такому же процессу обеспечения качества, о котором только что говорилось.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;сноски&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/povOnDemand.aspx&quot;&gt;http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/povOnDemand.aspx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-6&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators&quot;&gt;https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-индикаторы&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-7&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/health-accounts/ghed/en/&quot;&gt;http://www.who.int/health- accounts/ghed/en/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-8&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators&quot;&gt;https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-9&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Календарь&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Сбор данных:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Сбор данных осуществляется в соответствии с графиком, разработанным в стране, по проведению обследований расходов домашних хозяйств, обследований бюджетов домашних хозяйств и обследований доходов и расходов домашних хозяйств.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Выпуск данных:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Оценки доли населения с большим удельным весом семейных расходов на медицинскую помощь в общем объеме расходов или доходов домохозяйств были опубликованы в декабре 2017 года. В дальнейшем будут добавляться новые данные по мере получения дополнительной информации от назначенных координаторов (см. Процесс сбора данных). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Обновление региональных и глобальных оценок планируется проводить каждые два года.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Поставщики данных&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Национальные статистические управления в сотрудничестве с министерствами здравоохранения. Более подробную информацию см. в источниках данных.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Составители данных&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Всемирная организация здравоохранения и Всемирный банк.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Обоснование:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Задача 3.8 определена следующим образом: обеспечить всеобщий охват услугами здравоохранения, в том числе защиту от финансовых рисков, доступ к качественным основным медико-санитарным услугам и доступ к безопасным, эффективным, качественным и недорогим основным лекарственным средствам и вакцинам для всех. Задача заключается в том, чтобы гарантировать для всех людей и сообщества в целом получение качественных медицинских услуг, в которых они нуждаются (включая лекарства и другие медицинские товары), без возникновения финансовых затруднений. Для мониторинга задачи 3.8 в рамках ЦУР были выбраны два показателя. Показатель 3.8.1 предназначен для оценки охвата услугами здравоохранения, который ассоциируется с индексом, объединяющим 16 показателей оценки охвата услугами здравоохранения, включая репродуктивное здоровье, здоровье матерей и детей, заболеваемость инфекционными болезнями, заболеваемость неинфекционными болезнями, а также потенциал оказания медицинских услуг и доступ в единую сводную систему показателей. Показатель 3.8.2 фокусируется на расходах на здравоохранение во взаимосвязи с бюджетом домохозяйства для выявления финансовых затруднений, вызванных прямыми платежами за медицинское обслуживание. Взятые вместе, показатели 3.8.1 и 3.8.2 предназначены для выявления охвата услуг и аспектов финансовой защиты, соответствующих задаче 3.8. Эти два показателя должны всегда отслеживаться совместно.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Показатель 3.8.2 основан на методологиях, разработанных в 1990-х годах в сотрудничестве с учеными Всемирного банка и Всемирной организации здравоохранения. Показатель 3.8.2 предназначен для определения населения, которому приходится тратить значительную долю общих расходов или доходов своих домохозяйств на здравоохранение. Основное внимание уделяется платежам, осуществляемым во время оказания услуги для получения врачебной помощи любого типа, от любого поставщика, для лечения любого типа заболевания или решения любой проблемы со здоровьем, за вычетом каких-либо возмещений лицу, которое произвело платеж, но исключая любой тип предоплаты за медицинские услуги; например, в виде налогов или специальных страховых премий или взносов. Прямые выплаты являются наименее справедливой схемой оплаты услуг системы здравоохранения, поскольку такие выплаты ограничивают пределы получаемой помощи. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Это явно противоречит духу поставленной задачи, которая требует предоставления доступа к медицинским услугам, основываясь на потребностях в сохранении здоровья, а не в способности домохозяйства собирать все свои финансовые ресурсы для удовлетворения потребностей своих членов в получении медицинских услуг. Некоторые прямые платежи могут оказаться необходимыми, но показатель 3.8.2 основан на уверенности в том, что ни один человек с любым уровнем доходов не должно стоять перед выбором между расходами на здравоохранение и расходами на другие основные товары и услуги, такие как расходы на обучение, покупку продовольствия, оплату жилья и коммунальных услуг. Один из способов оценки пределов, вне которых системы здравоохранения приводят к финансовым затруднениям, состоит в том, чтобы определить долю населения с большим удельным весом семейных расходов на медицинскую помощь в общем объеме расходов или доходов домохозяйств. Для получения подробной информации об определении, выбранном для мониторинга аспекта финансовой защиты всеобщего охвата медико-санитарными услугами в рамках системы мониторинга ЦУР (показатель 3.8.2), см. Wagstaff et al. (2018) и главу 2 доклада ВОЗ и Всемирного банка &quot;Отслеживание всеобщего охвата услугами здравоохранения: доклад о глобальном мониторинге за 2017 год&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Комментарии и ограничения:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Можно проводить мониторинг показателя 3.8.2 на регулярной основе, используя те же данные обследования домохозяйств, которые используются для мониторинга задач 1.1 и 1.2 ЦУР по бедности.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-10&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-10&quot; &gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.Эти обследования также регулярно проводятся для других целей, таких как расчет весов для индекса потребительских цен. Эти обследования обычно проводятся национальными статистическими управлениями. Таким образом, мониторинг доли населения с большим удельным весом семейных расходов на медицинскую помощь в общем объеме расходов или доходов домохозяйств не добавляет дополнительного бремени, связанного со сбором данных, при условии, что можно выделить компонент расходов на здравоохранение в данных по непродовольственным потребительским расходам домохозяйства. Хотя данный подход обладает несомненными преимуществами, показатель 3.8.2 страдает от тех же проблем своевременности, частоты проведения обследований, качества и сопоставимости данных обследований, что и показатель ЦУР 1.1.1. При этом показатель 3.8.2 имеет свои концептуальные и эмпирические ограничения.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Во-первых, с помощью показателя 3.8.2 делаются попытки определить финансовые трудности, с которыми сталкиваются люди при использовании средств своего дохода, сбережений или в связи с необходимостью получения кредитов для оплаты медицинских услуг. Однако большинство обследований домохозяйств не позволяют определить источник финансирования, используемый домохозяйством, отчитывающимся о расходах на здравоохранение. В странах, где нет ретроспективной компенсации затрат домохозяйств на здравоохранение, это не является проблемой. Если домохозяйство отчитывается о каких-либо расходах на здравоохранение, это будет означать, что эти расходы не будут возмещены какой-либо третьей стороной. Следовательно, такое положение соответствует определению, данному для прямых платежей на здравоохранение (числитель). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;С другой стороны, для тех стран, где существует ретроспективная компенсация затрат, например, через систему обязательного медицинского страхования - сумма, включаемая домохозяйством в отчет о расходах на здравоохранение, может быть полностью или частично возмещена на более позднем этапе, возможно, за пределами периода сбора отчетов от домохозяйств в рамках проведения обследования. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Очевидно, что требуется провести дополнительную работу для обеспечения того, чтобы инструментарий обследования обеспечивал сбор информации об источниках финансирования, используемых домохозяйством для оплаты медицинских услуг, или в инструментарии обследования домохозяйств всегда должно присутствовать указание на то, что расходы на здравоохранение должны учитываться за вычетом какой-либо компенсации. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Во-вторых, в текущем определении показателя 3.8.2 большой удельный вес расходов на здравоохранение можно определить, сравнивая расходы домохозяйства на здравоохранение с доходом домохозяйства или с общими расходами домохозяйства. Расходы - это рекомендуемая мера ресурсов домохозяйств (см. Концептуальный раздел), но в одной из недавних эмпирических работ было показано, что, хотя статистические данные по показателю 3.8.2 на страновом уровне довольно малочувствительны к такому выбору, их разбивка по группам доходов довольно чувствительна к нему. Оценки, основанные на доходах, показывают более высокую концентрацию доли населения с большим удельным весом расходов домохозяйств на здравоохранение среди бедных, чем оценки, основанные на расходах (см. Главу 2 в отчете ВОЗ и Всемирного банка за 2017 год &quot;Отслеживание всеобщего охвата услугами здравоохранения: доклад о глобальном мониторинге за 2017 год&quot;, а также Wagstaff et al 2018 ) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;В-третьих, показатель 3.8.2. опирается на одну общую точку отсечения для определения того, что представляет собой большой удельный вес семейных расходов на медицинскую помощь в общем объеме расходов или доходов домохозяйств. Люди, находящиеся чуть ниже такого порога, не принимаются во внимание, что всегда является проблемой с оценками, основанными на отсечениях. Этого просто избежать, построив график кумулятивной функции распределения соотношения расходов на здравоохранение, присущих показателю 3.8.2. Таким образом, для любого порога можно определить долю населения, выделяющего некую часть бюджета своего домохозяйства на здравоохранение. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;В-четвертых, показатель 3.8.2. основан на оценке фактических расходов на здравоохранение. Низкие уровни понесенных расходов могут быть обусловлены ошибками измерений, такими как ошибки, не зависящие от выборочного наблюдения, например, очень короткий период сбора отчетности, который не позволяет получить информацию о медицинской помощи, требующей госпитализации на какое-то время, или ошибок, зависящих от выборки, таких как чрезмерная выборка районов с особенно низким уровнем заболеваемости. Отсутствие расходов также может быть вызвано тем, что люди не могут ничего потратить на здравоохранение, что, по крайней мере для услуг, включенных в показатель 3.8.1, должно привести к низким уровням охвата. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Есть и другие показатели, используемые для оценки финансовых трудностей. ВОЗ использует структуру, которая включает, в дополнение к показателю 3.8.2, определение крупных расходов на здравоохранение по сравнению с расходами, не связанными с оплатой питания и проживания.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-11&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-11&quot;&gt;[11]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-12&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-12&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-13&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-13&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf&quot;&gt;http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-10&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapter 2 in &amp;#x201C;Tracking universal health coverage: 2017 global monitoring report&amp;#x201D;, World Health Organization and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/  The World Bank; 2017; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/healthinfo/indicators/2015/en/&quot;&gt;http://www.who.int/healthinfo/indicators/2015/en/&lt;/a&gt; ;  &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-11&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xu, K., Evans, D.

&lt;p&gt;где &lt;em&gt; i &lt;/em&gt; означает домохозяйство, &lt;em&gt; 1 () &lt;/em&gt; - это функция показателя, которая принимает значение 1, если выражение в скобках является истинной величиной, и 0 в противном случае, &lt;em&gt; m &lt;sub &gt; i &lt;/sub&gt; &lt;/em&gt; соответствует количеству членов домохозяйства &lt;em&gt; i &lt;/em&gt;, соответствует весу выборки домохозяйства &lt;em&gt; i &lt;/em&gt;, является порогом, определяющим большой удельный вес семейных расходов на медицинскую помощь в общем объеме расходов или доходов домохозяйств (т.е. 10% и 25%). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Расходы домохозяйства на здравоохранение и расходы или доход домохозяйства определяются, как описано в разделе «Понятия». Для получения дополнительной информации о методологии, см. Wagstaff et al (2018) и главу 2 в отчете ВОЗ и Всемирного банка за 2017 год &quot;Отслеживание всеобщего охвата услугами здравоохранения: доклад о глобальном мониторинге за 2017 год&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Обработка отсутствующих значений:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;На страновом уровне не делается никаких попыток произвести оценку. Доля населения с большим удельным весом семейных расходов на здравоохранение в общем объеме расходов или доходов домохозяйств оценивается за все годы, для которых имеются данные репрезентативного на национальном уровне обследования бюджета, доходов и расходов домохозяйств, социально-экономических условий или уровня жизни с информацией, отражающей как общие расходы или доходы домохозяйства, так и общие расходы домохозяйства на здравоохранение. Если для одной и той же страны с течением времени осуществляются комплексные обследования, предпочтение отдается оценкам, составленным на основе аналогичного обследования. Для сохранения наиболее представительных временных рядов проводится серия тестов (см. Процесс сбора).&lt;h2&gt;Региональные агрегаты:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Для построения оценок на региональном и глобальном уровнях, когда оценки, основанные на обследованиях, отсутствуют для 2000, 2005 или 2010 базисных годов, то все оценки, основанные на обследовании, проведенном в базисном году, который приходится на один из годов внутри пятилетнего периода, &quot;коррелируются&quot; путем сочетания интерполяции, экстраполяции, методов эконометрического моделирования и условного исчисления на основе региональных медиан (Wagstaff et al., 2018; глава 2 в отчете ВОЗ и Всемирного банка за 2017 год об отслеживании всеобщего охвата услугами здравоохранения).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Всемирный банк и Всемирная организация здравоохранения используют свою собственную систему региональных группировок в дополнение к региональной разбивке, предложенной Статистическим отделом ООН для ЦУР.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Доступные странам методы и руководства для составления данных на национальном уровне:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Обеспечение качества: &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Наличие данных&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Этот показатель основывается главным образом на тех же источниках данных, которые используются для мониторинга показателя 1.1.1 ЦУР , включая дополнительное требование наличия информации о расходах на здравоохранение. Принимая во внимание это условие, Всемирный банк и ВОЗ выявили 1566 потенциально подходящих наборов данных обследования домашних хозяйств из 155 стран. В дальнейшем некоторые из них были исключены, поскольку данные тех обследований либо были недоступны, или отсутствовали ключевые переменные, необходимые для оценки доли населения с большим удельным весом семейных расходов на медицинскую помощь в общем объеме расходов или доходов домохозяйств, или они не прошли процесс обеспечения надлежащего качества или не были частью последовательных временных рядов. По состоянию на декабрь 2017 года для получения показателя ЦУР 3.8.2 было использовано в общей сложности 553 элемента данных из 132 стран или территорий за период 1984-2015 годов. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Наличие информации по ряду стран, данные которых ВОЗ и Всемирный банк в настоящее время изучили и сохранили для оценки &quot;доли населения с большим удельным весом семейных расходов на медицинскую помощь в общем объеме расходов или доходов домохозяйств&quot;, за последний имеющийся год выглядит следующим образом:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Общая оценка наличия данных охватывает не менее 50% всех государств-членов ВОЗ во всех регионах M49, за исключением тех, которые находятся в Океании (7,1%). Для получения дополнительной информации, см. отчет ВОЗ и Всемирного банка за 2017 год об отслеживании всеобщего охвата услугами здравоохранения; Wagstaff et al 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Временные ряды:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Периодичность таких данных аналогична периодичности данных, используемых для разработки показателя ЦУР 1.1.1. Она варьируется в зависимости от страны, но в среднем составляет от 1 года до 3–5 лет.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Дезагрегирование:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Следующее дезагрегирование возможно, поскольку обследование было разработано для получения репрезентативных оценок на таком уровне:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Пол и возраст главы домохозяйства&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Географическое положение (сельская местность / город)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Квинтили оценки благосостояния домохозяйства (общие расходы или доход домохозяйства).
См. комментарии и ограничения в отношении чувствительности дезагрегации к выбору оценки благосостояния.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Источники расхождений:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Все оценки на страновом уровне основаны на репрезентативных на национальном уровне обследованиях, включающих информацию как об общих расходах или доходах домохозяйств, так и о расходах домохозяйств на здравоохранение (см. Источники данных). В большинстве случаев такие данные поступают из нестандартизированных обследований домашних хозяйств, а процессы последующей стандартизации могут быть разработаны для повышения степени сопоставимости между странами. Например, группы Всемирного банка, ответственные за региональные показатели, создают стандартизированные версии наборов первичных данных на основе общих региональных процедур: гармонизированные наборы данных ECAPOV основаны на наборах данных исследования по измерению уровня жизни (LSMS) &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-14&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-14&quot;&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; или обследования бюджетов домашних хозяйств (ОБДХ), собранных в регионе Европы и Центральной Азии, который курирует Всемирный банк; набор данных SHIP является результатом реализации программы борьбы с бедностью в рамках согласованных обследований домашних хозяйств в африканском регионе, который курирует Всемирный банк, в то время как процедура сбора данных SHES была разработана Всемирным банком для международной программы сопоставлений. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-15&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-15&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;Наборы данных Люксембургского исследования доходов (LIS) являются результатом усилий по гармонизации наборов данных из многих стран с высоким и средним уровнем дохода. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-16&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-16&quot;&gt;[16]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;В некоторых случаях первичные данные доступны для получения оценок на страновом уровне. В некоторых странах в дополнение к первичным данным имеется стандартизированная версия первичных данных, а в других странах имеется только стандартизированная версия. Когда доступны комплексные версии одного и того же обследования, сохраняется наилучшая из реализованных версий с точки зрения проведенной серии проверок на обеспечение качества (см. Процесс сбора). При выборе стандартизированной версии инструментариев обследования, разработанных на национальном уровне, существуют различия между переменными расходов, произведенных с использованием первичных данных, и переменными расходов, произведенных с использованием процедур гармонизации, которые могут привести к различиям в оценке доли населения с большим удельным весом семейных расходов на медицинскую помощь в общем объеме расходов или доходов домохозяйств.
