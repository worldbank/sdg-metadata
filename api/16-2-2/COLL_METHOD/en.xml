	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data are collected by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) from national authorities with the annual Questionnaire for the Global Report on Trafficking in Persons (GLOTIP). National focal points working in national agencies responsible for trafficking in persons, statistics on crime and/or the criminal justice system and nominated by the Permanent Mission to UNODC are responsible for compiling the data from the other relevant agencies before transmitting the GLOTIP questionnaire to UNODC. Following the submission, UNODC checks the data for consistency and coherence with other data sources. Member States that are also part of the European Union or the European Free Trade Association, or candidate or potential candidate to the European Union channel their responses through Eurostat. Data submitted by Member States through other means or taken from other sources, namely official websites of national authorities or governments&amp;#x2019; reports are added to the dataset after review by Member States.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
