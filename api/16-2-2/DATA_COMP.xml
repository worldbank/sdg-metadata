			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;This numerator of this indicator is composed of two parts: detected and undetected victims of trafficking in persons. The detected part of trafficking victims, as resulting from investigation and prosecution activities of criminal justice system, is counted and reported by national law enforcement authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methodology to estimate the number of undetected victims of trafficking in persons is under development: some methods have been identified , but further testing is needed to produce a consolidated and agreed upon approach. The method to estimate undetected victims will have to allow the estimation of victims characteristics (sex and age) and the forms of exploitation suffered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator will be calculated as the ratio between the sum of detected and undetected victims of trafficking and the population resident in the country, multiplied by 100,000&lt;/p&gt;
