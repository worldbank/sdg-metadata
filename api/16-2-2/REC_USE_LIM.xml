			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The count of detected victims of trafficking has the benefit of referring to victims as defined by the UN Protocol where the act, the mean and the purpose of trafficking have been identified by the national authorities. However it does not cover the dark number of crime, i.e. the number of victims non detected by the authorities. While information on detected victims can provide valuable information to monitor sex and age profile of detected victims, as well as on forms of exploitation ,trafficking flows, the number of detected victims per se doesn&amp;#x2019;t monitor the level of trafficking of persons so interpretation of trends should be done with caution, as changes in detected victims of trafficking can be due to multiple factors such as intensity of trafficking flows but also to changes of law enforcement practices, changes in legislation, or changes in victims attitudes,.&lt;/p&gt;
