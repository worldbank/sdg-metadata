{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 16-2-2, translated into en","data":"<p>The total number of victims of trafficking in persons is defined as the total number of victims officially detected by national authorities plus the number of undetected victims of trafficking. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, as data on the number of undetected victims is available only for a very limited number of countries and is not regularly monitored, the current computation of the indicator 16.2.2. only focuses on the number of detected victims of trafficking. The count of detected victims of trafficking has the benefit of referring to victims as defined by the UN Protocol, where the act, the mean and the purpose of trafficking have been identified by the national authorities. While information on detected victims can provide valuable information to monitor sex and age profile of detected victims, as well as on forms of exploitation, and trafficking flows, the number of detected victims per se does not monitor the level of trafficking of persons. Interpretation of trends should be done with caution, as changes in detected victims of trafficking can be due to multiple factors such as changes of law enforcement practices, changes in legislation, or changes in trafficking severity or patterns. A decrease over time in a given country may not necessarily reflect a reduced incidence of the crime, but rather a change in detection patterns that may be due to a number of underlying reasons. No clear target can be defined for this indicator until data availability will allow for the inclusion of undetected victims of trafficking. </p>"}
