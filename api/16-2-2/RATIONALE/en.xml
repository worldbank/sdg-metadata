	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 16-2-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Trafficking in persons is a serious crime and a grave violation of human rights. Every day, victims are exploited in restaurants, farms, construction sites, brothels, factories, markets, mines and in people&amp;#x2019;s homes everywhere, but little is known about the prevalence and characteristics of the crime. Better data is needed to inform more effective responses, and provide policymakers and practitioners with the information and analysis they need to sharpen anti-trafficking action and improve prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator aims to measure the prevalence of trafficking in persons according to the victims profile and the forms of exploitation, and to track global, regional, and national progress in combatting this crime. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
