The reported data accounts for a small percentage or the data needs: only 23 countries out of 185 reported on losses in 2016 for one commodity or more. The number of reporting countries was 42 in 2018 and 12 in 2019. As for the data only 7%% of loss factors in the SUA/FBS database are officially reported, all others being estimated.</p>\n<p>The index scope was reduced for international comparability purposes to exclude harvest losses, which are critical at the production stage. Moreover, the index covers only two commodities in each food group, because requesting regular loss data for a larger number of products would be a difficult and unsustainable exercise for most countries.</p>\n<p>The index monitors quantitative losses. Qualitative and economic losses that are also very relevant but not measurable in a consistent manner are out of the scope of the indicator.</p>\n<p>This indicator is particularly challenging because it requires data along the whole supply chain. The most appropriate data sources would be an ensemble of surveys however, most countries lack the capacity and resources to carry out this exercise. A suite of statistical and modelling tools combined where possible with administrative records will have to be used.</p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
