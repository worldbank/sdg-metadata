	<data>&lt;p&gt;Red List Assessments are checked before submission to IUCN by Assessors and Red List Authority Coordinators, to ensure that all of the required supporting information is provided in the appropriate format, distribution maps follow the required mapping standards (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/mappingstandards&quot;&gt;https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/mappingstandards&lt;/a&gt;), and the IUCN Red List Criteria have been applied appropriately and consistently following IUCN Guidelines (IUCN SPSC 2019). For further details, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucnredlist.org/assessment/process&quot;&gt;https://www.iucnredlist.org/assessment/process&lt;/a&gt;. All submitted assessments must be reviewed by at least one Reviewer designated by the Red List Authority. For more details on the review process, see the Rules of Procedure (&lt;a href=&quot;https://nc.iucnredlist.org/redlist/content/attachment_files/Rules_of_Procedure_for_IUCN_Red_List_2017-2020.pdf&quot;&gt;https://nc.iucnredlist.org/redlist/content/attachment_files/Rules_of_Procedure_for_IUCN_Red_List_2017-2020.pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Red List Indices are updated each year, the updated index (and underlying numbers of species in each Red List Category) are made available for review by countries prior to submission to the SDG Indicators Database. This is achieved through updating the country profiles in the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles&quot;&gt;https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles&lt;/a&gt;) and circulating these for consultation and review to CBD National Focal Points, SDG National Statistical Office Focal Points, and IUCN State Members.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
