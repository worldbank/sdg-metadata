In sum: the data underlying the Red List Index are compiled under the authority of the IUCN Red List Committee, through application of the IUCN Red List Categories &amp; Criteria (<a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10315\">https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10315</a>). This includes submissions of endemics from national red list processes, where these have been conducted following the &#x201C;Guidelines for application of IUCN Red List Criteria at Regional and National Levels&#x201D; (<a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10336\">https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10336</a>) and following the &#x201C;Required and Recommended Supporting Information for IUCN Red List Assessments&#x201D; (<a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/supporting-information-guidelines\">https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/supporting-information-guidelines</a>). Assessments may be submitted in all three IUCN languages (English, French and Spanish) and Portuguese. All assessments are peer reviewed through the relevant Red List Authority for the species or species group in question, as documented in the Red List Rules of Procedure (<a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/rules-of-procedure\">https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/rules-of-procedure</a>); see in particular Annex 3, the &#x201C;Details of the Steps Involved in the IUCN Red List Process&#x201D; (<a href=\"https://nc.iucnredlist.org/redlist/content/attachment_files/Details_of_the_Steps_Involved_in_the_IUCN_Red_List_Process.pdf\">https://nc.iucnredlist.org/redlist/content/attachment_files/Details_of_the_Steps_Involved_in_the_IUCN_Red_List_Process.pdf</a>).</p>\n<p>The key document providing international recommendations and guidelines to countries and all involved in application of the IUCN Red List Categories &amp; Criteria (<a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10315\">https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10315</a>) is the &#x201C;Guidelines for Using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria&#x201D; (<a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/redlistguidelines\">https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/redlistguidelines</a>; available in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese) accompanied by the &#x201C;Required and Recommended Supporting Information for IUCN Red List Assessments&#x201D;. For countries (and regions), this is supplemented by the &#x201C;Guidelines for application of IUCN Red List Criteria at Regional and National Levels&#x201D; (<a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10336\">https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10336</a>). To support the calculation of Red List Indices for any given country (or region), &#x201C;Code (and documentation) for calculating and plotting national RLIs weighted by the proportion of each species&#x2019; distribution within a country or region&#x201D; is posted online (Dias et al. 2020; <a href=\"https://github.com/BirdLifeInternational/rli-codes\">https://github.com/BirdLifeInternational/rli-codes</a>). </p>\n<p>Methods for generating national disaggregations of the Red List Index are described below in section 5 on Data availability and disaggregation.</p>"}
