&lt;p&gt;The Red List Index for a particular country or region is an index of the aggregate extinction risk for species within the country or region relative to its potential contribution to global species extinction risk (within the taxonomic groups included).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is measured on a scale of 0 to 1, where 1 is the maximum contribution that the country or region can make to global species survival, equating to all species being classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, and 0 is the minimum contribution that the country or region can make to global species survival, equating to all species in the country or region having gone extinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
