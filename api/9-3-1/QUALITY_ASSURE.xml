While these generally accepted, broad dimensions of quality of statistical data may be defined in each NSO&amp;apos;s own quality assurance framework. UNIDO makes maximum effort that data produced from the statistical operation undertaken with the UNIDO technical cooperation are accurate, internationally comparable and coherent.&lt;/p&gt;
