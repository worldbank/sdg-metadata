	<data>&lt;p&gt;It is calculated as raw material equivalent of imports (RME&lt;sub&gt;IM&lt;/sub&gt;) plus domestic extraction (DE) minus raw material equivalents of exports (RME&lt;sub&gt;EX&lt;/sub&gt;). For the attribution of the primary material needs of final demand a global, multi-regional input-output (MRIO) framework is employed. The attribution method based on I-O analytical tools is described in detail in Wiedmann et al. 2015. It is based on the EORA MRIO framework developed by the University of Sydney, Australia (Lenzen et al. 2013) which is an internationally well-established and the most detailed and reliable MRIO framework available to date. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
