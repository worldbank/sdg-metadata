There are over 140,000 different substances used in all economic sectors globally. Their benefits are many and so too are their potential to adversely impact human health and the environment if not properly managed. All countries, especially middle- and low-income countries, are facing the complex challenge of managing hazardous waste according to international standards of good practice. The situation is complicated by limited human, financial and/or technical resources. As such, action is needed to support the sustainable use of chemicals and environmentally sound management of hazardous waste. There is also a rapid increase in the generation of hazardous waste. Where most of the conventional hazardous wastes are produced in industrial and manufacturing operations, significant amounts are generated in non-industrial sectors, including sludge from the healthcare sector; waste-water treatment plants, waste oils, and waste batteries. There is also an increase in the complexity of products and unidentified hazardous components like coatings, and/or items which are not hazardous (laminates and multi-layer packaging), but present hazardousness in a variety of ways when improperly discarded and end up in air, water or are burned.</p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
