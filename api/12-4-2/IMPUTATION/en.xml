	<message>The IMPUTATION field for indicator 12-4-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), which conducts the data collection, validation and dissemination process via the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics, does not make any estimation or imputation for missing values, so the number of data points provided are actual country data. However, UNEP is considering the possibility of global modelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Eurostat also do not make any estimation or imputation for missing values.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
