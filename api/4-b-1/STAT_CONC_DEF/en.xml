&lt;p&gt;Gross disbursements of total ODA from all donors for scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concepts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ODA: The DAC defines ODA as &amp;#x201C;those flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i) provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent). (See http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholarships: Financial aid awards for individual students and contributions to trainees. The beneficiary students and trainees are nationals of developing countries. Financial aid awards include bilateral&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;grants to students registered for systematic instruction in private or public institutions of higher education to follow full-time studies or training courses in the donor country. Estimated tuition costs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of students attending schools financed by the donor but not receiving individual grants are not included here, but under item imputed student costs (CRS sector code 1520). Training costs relate to contributions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for trainees from developing countries receiving mainly non-academic, practical or vocational training in the donor country.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
