	<data>&lt;p&gt;AMR is an emerging global threat and risk to public health worldwide. In its early implementation phase of the global antimicrobial resistance surveillance system (GLASS), WHO recognizes various constraints in obtaining unbiased, representative AMR data: number and distribution of surveillance sites and representativeness of surveillance data, sampling bias, poor diagnostic capacity, measurements errors, issues with data management. It is imperative that countries should have a functioning national system to support AMR surveillance and report to GLASS. More detailed GLASS methodology and limitations of data currently submitted by countries can be found in the GLASS report&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-7&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-7&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. AMR surveillance, country preparedness and response are now high priority for WHO and its Member States. In the next five years, WHO aims to provide intensified technical assistance. Experience gained and lessons learnt from the further implementation of the national AMR surveillance systems will increase effectiveness, address limitations, and the make the data more robust. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-7&quot;&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Global antimicrobial resistance surveillance system (GLASS) report: &lt;/strong&gt;Early implementation 2017-2018 (2019). &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/279656/9789241515061-eng.pdf&quot;&gt;https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/279656/9789241515061-eng.pdf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-7&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</data>
