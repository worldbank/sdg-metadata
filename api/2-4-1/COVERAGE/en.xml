	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 2-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is currently in the Tier II category because few countries are able to report it. Data are expected to be collected either as part of existing farm surveys or through other data sources such as environmental monitoring systems, administrative data or household surveys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive capacity development efforts (using a mix of in person, mass online trainings and bilateral assistance) are underway to build countries capacities. The data will be reported by end of 2022, once the third and final round of the 3 years data collection and reporting cycle is completed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time series:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SDG Indicator 2.4.1 measures progress towards more sustainable and productive agriculture over a three-year periodicity because for many sub-indicators, it is likely that changes will be relatively limited from a year to another. Furthermore, the 3-year periodicity will enable countries to have three data points on the indicator before 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicator 2.4.1 is expected to be collected through farm surveys and the result expressed as a national value. However, the methodology is scale independent and can be adopted at any geographical level. In addition, the indicator can be disaggregated according to type of farming system (crop, livestock or mixed) and other characteristics of the farm e.g. household/non-household sector, irrigated/non-irrigated or gender of the farm holder.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
