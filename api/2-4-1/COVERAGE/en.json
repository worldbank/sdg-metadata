{"status":"success","message":"The COVERAGE field for indicator 2-4-1, translated into en","data":"<p>Data availability:</p>\n<p>Many sub-indicators for this indicator are already being collected in countries, either as part of existing farm surveys or through other data sources such as environmental monitoring systems, administrative data or household surveys. Yet they are not collected with a common set of criteria that fulfil the indicator requirements, guarantee the same quality or adherence to international comparability. </p>\n<h2>Time series:</h2>\n<p>SDG Indicator 2.4.1 measures progress towards more sustainable and productive agriculture over a three year periodicity because for many sub-indicators, it is likely that changes will be relatively limited from a year to another. Furthermore, the 3-year periodicity will enable countries to have three data points on the indicator before 2030.</p>\n<p>Disaggregation:</p>\n<p>Indicator 2.4.1 is expected to be collected through farm surveys and the result expressed as a national value. However, the methodology is scale independent and can be adopted at any geographical level. In addition the indicator can be disaggregated according to type of farming system (crop, livestock or mixed) and other characteristics of the farm e.g. household/non-household sector, irrigated/non-irrigated or gender of the farm holder.</p>"}
