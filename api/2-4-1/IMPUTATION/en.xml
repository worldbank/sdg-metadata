	<message>The IMPUTATION field for indicator 2-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Partial non-response at individual level (farm holding) will be imputed using appropriate statistical techniques, such as nearest-neighbour algorithms. The decision on whether to impute or not and the choice of the method is a function of the nature of the variable to impute and the amount and type of data available for the imputation, such as the availability of auxiliary data coming from different sources (e.g. surveys, administrative information). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to clearly distinguish missing data from non-applicable events. As specified above and in the sub-indicator methodology sheets, some sub-indicators can be recorded as &amp;#x2018;not applicable&amp;#x2019; for a given farm. In this case, the farm will be considered sustainable from the perspective of the given sub-indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#x2022; At country level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#x2022; At regional and global levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</data>
