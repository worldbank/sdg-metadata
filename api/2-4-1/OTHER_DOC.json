Farm output value per hectare</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension: </strong>Economic<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Theme: </strong>Land Productivity </p>\n<p>Land productivity is a measure of agricultural value of outputs obtained on a given area of land. Maintaining or improving the output over time relative to the area of land used is an important aspect in sustainability for a range of reasons. At farm level, the land productivity reflects technology and production processes for given agro-ecological conditions. In a broader sense, an increase in the level of land productivity enables higher production while reducing pressure on increasingly scarce land resources, commonly linked to deforestation and associated losses of ecosystem services and biodiversity.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Coverage</strong>: All farm types </p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong></p>\n<p>The sub-indicator is described as farm output value per hectare (holdings that produce crops and livestock or its mix). Information on farm outputs and agricultural area should be standard information available from farm surveys thus providing a good basis for assessment at farm level.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Farm output value: The volume of agricultural output at farm level generally takes into account production of multiple outputs, e.g. crop types and crop and livestock combinations, etc. Since the volume of agricultural outputs is not measured in commensurate units (e.g. not all outputs are measured in tonnes, and tonnes of different output represent different products), it is necessary to establish an appropriate means of aggregation, in this case using a monetary unit. A simple way to enable aggregation is to reflect the multiple outputs produced by a single farm in terms of values (i.e. quantity multiplied by prices).</li>\n  <li>Farm agricultural land area: defined as the area of land used for agriculture within the farm<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[2]</a></sup>. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sustainability criteria: </strong></p>\n<p>Distance from the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile of the national distribution<sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-ref-4\">[3]</a></sup>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Green (desirable): Sub-indicator value is &#x2265; 2/3 of the corresponding 90<sup>th</sup> percentile </li>\n  <li>Yellow (acceptable): Sub-indicator value is &#x2265; 1/3 and &lt; 2/3 of the corresponding 90<sup>th</sup> percentile </li>\n  <li>Red (unsustainable): Sub-indicator value is &lt; 1/3 of the corresponding 90<sup>th</sup> percentile</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Data items:</strong></p>\n<p>Reference period: last calendar year</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ol>\n      <li>Quantities and farm gate prices (or value of production) of the 5 main crops and/or livestock products and by-products produced by the farm</li>\n      <li>Quantities and farm gate prices (or value of production) of other agricultural products (agro-forestry or aquaculture products etc.) produced by the farm </li>\n      <li>Agricultural land area of the holding</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>2. Net Farm Income:</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension:</strong> Economic<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Theme:</strong> Profitability</p>\n<p>An important part of sustainability in agriculture is the economic viability of the farm, driven to a large extent by its profitability. Profitability is measured using the net income that the farmer is able to gain from farming operations. Availability and use of information on farm economic performance, measured using profitability, will support better decision making both at micro and macro-economic level. Since performance measures drive behaviour, better information on performance can alter behaviour and decision-making by government and producers both in large-scale commercial farming and medium and small-scale subsistence agriculture.</p>\n<p><strong>Coverage:</strong> All farms types </p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong></p>\n<p>The sub-indicator measures if the farm is consistently profitable over a 3-year period. The focus of this sub-indicator is on income from farming operations as distinct from the total income of the farming household, which may include other sources of income such as, for example, employment in local businesses by other family members, tourism activity, etc.</p>\n<p>Formula<sup><a href=\"#footnote-5\" id=\"footnote-ref-5\">[4]</a></sup>:</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi>N</mi>\n    <mi>F</mi>\n    <mi>I</mi>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>C</mi>\n    <mi>R</mi>\n    <mo>+</mo>\n    <msub>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>Y</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>k</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msub>\n    <mo>-</mo>\n    <mi>O</mi>\n    <mi>E</mi>\n    <mo>-</mo>\n    <mi>D</mi>\n    <mi>e</mi>\n    <mi>p</mi>\n    <mo>+</mo>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>V</mi>\n    <mi>I</mi>\n    <mi>C</mi>\n  </math></p>\n<p>where:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>NFI = Total Net Farm Income</li>\n  <li>CR = Total farm cash receipts including direct program payments</li>\n  <li>Y<sub>k</sub> = Income in kind</li>\n  <li>OE = Total operating expenses after rebates (including costs of labour)</li>\n  <li>Dep = Depreciation</li>\n  <li>VIC = Value of inventory change</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Definitions:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Net farm income refers to the return (both monetary and non-monetary) to farm operators for their labor, management and capital, after all production expenses have been paid (that is, gross farm income minus production expenses). It includes net income from farm production, the value of commodities consumed on the farm, depreciation, and inventory changes.</li>\n  <li>Gross farm income refers to the monetary and non-monetary income received by farm. Its main components include cash receipts from the sale of farm products, direct program payments to producers, other farm income (such as income from custom work), value of food and fuel produced and consumed on the same farm, and change in value of year-end inventories of crops and livestock<sup><a href=\"#footnote-6\" id=\"footnote-ref-6\">[5]</a></sup>.</li>\n  <li>Farm cash receipts include revenues from the sale of agricultural commodities in local currency units that include sales of crops, livestock and its by-products.</li>\n  <li>Direct program payments to producers included in farm cash receipts represent the amounts paid under various government and private programs to individuals involved in agricultural production. The payments related to current agricultural production include subsidies to encourage production or to compensate producers for low market returns, payments to stabilize incomes and payments to compensate producers for crop or livestock losses caused by extreme climatic conditions, disease or other reasons and insurance payments.</li>\n  <li>Income-in-kind measures the value of the agricultural goods produced on farms and consumed by farm operator families. It is included to measure total farm production. </li>\n  <li>Operating expenses represent business costs incurred by farm businesses for goods and services used in the production process. Expenses include both purchase and self-produced items that are: property taxes, custom work, seeds, rent, fertiliser and lime, chemicals, machinery and building repairs, irrigation, fuel for heating and machines, wages, interest and business share of insurance premiums. </li>\n  <li>Depreciation charges account for the economic depreciation or for the loss in fair market value of the capital assets of the farm business. Calculated on farm buildings, farm machinery, and the farm business share of autos, trucks and the farm home, depreciation is generally considered to be the result of aging, wear and tear, and obsolescence. It represents a decrease in the potential economic benefits that can be generated by the capital asset. </li>\n  <li>Value of inventory change (VIC) measures the currency value of the physical change in producer-owned inventories. This concept is used to value total agricultural economic production. To calculate VIC, the change in producer-owned inventories (between the end and the beginning of a calendar year) is first derived and then multiplied by the average annual crop prices or value per animal. This calculation is different from the financial or accounting book value approach, which values the beginning and ending stocks, and then derives the change.</li>\n  <li>The VIC over all the major commodities can vary widely (depending on the size of the change of inventories and prices). The VIC can be either positive (when inventories are larger at the end of the year compared to the beginning levels) or negative (when year- end inventories are smaller than the levels at the beginning of the year). If the inventory levels are the same at the beginning and end of the year, VIC will be zero despite price changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Estimating profitability at a farm level will generally require compilation of basic farm financial records, i.e. daily, weekly, monthly or seasonal transactions in an organized way. In general, large commercial farms maintain detailed financial records however, in case of medium farms and small subsistence agriculture, record keeping is seldom practiced and in most of the countries it doesn&#x2019;t exist at all. </p>\n<p>In case when detailed data are not available at farm level, then estimates will be calculated based on farmer declaration of both outputs and inputs quantities and prices. In these cases, depreciation, variation of stocks and taxes may be neglected. This is described below as simplified option (1).</p>\n<p>A simplified option (2) is also offered, based on farmer&#x2019;s declaration of the agricultural holding&#x2019;s profitability over the last three calendar years. It is recommended to use this simplified option only when other two options are not feasible.</p>\n<p><strong>Sustainability criteria: </strong></p>\n<p>For a farm to be profitable the net farm income should be above zero. </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Green (desirable): above zero for past 3 consecutive years</li>\n  <li>Yellow (acceptable): above zero for at least 1 of the past 3 consecutive years</li>\n  <li>Red (unsustainable): below zero for all of the past 3 consecutive years</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Data items:</strong></p>\n<p>Reference period: last three calendar years</p>\n<p><strong><em>Recommended option:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Data from farm financial records, i.e. daily, weekly, monthly or seasonal transactions are collected in an organized way (in general, large commercial farms maintain detailed financial records on the basis of which the NFI can be calculated as per above equation). </p>\n<p><strong><em>Simplified option (1):</em></strong></p>\n<p>To be used when the detailed data are not available at farm level (better adapted to smallholders and household sector). </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ol>\n      <li>Quantity produced (i.e. crops and livestock and its products and by-products produced both for market or self-consumption) </li>\n      <li>Farm gate prices of the above quantities produces</li>\n      <li>Operating expenses including inputs quantities and its market prices</li>\n      <li>Quantity/output of other on-farm activities carried out and/or commodities produced on the holding e.g. aquaculture, agroforestry and others</li>\n      <li>Farm gate prices of the other on-farm activities/commodities</li>\n      <li>Input quantities and prices that are used to produce other on-farm outputs</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Simplified option (2):</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ol>\n      <li>Respondent&#x2019;s declaration on agricultural holding&#x2019;s profitability over the last 3 calendar years</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>3. Risk mitigation mechanisms</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension: </strong>Economic<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Theme: </strong>Resilience</p>\n<p>Resilience encompass absorptive, anticipatory and adaptive capacities and refers to the properties of a system that allows farms to deal with shocks and stresses, to persist and to continue to be well-functioning (in the sense of providing stability, predictable rules, security and other benefits to its members). </p>\n<p><strong>Coverage: </strong>All farms types<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong></p>\n<p>This sub-indicator measures the incidence of the following mitigation mechanisms: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Access to or availed credit<sup><a href=\"#footnote-7\" id=\"footnote-ref-7\">[6]</a></sup></li>\n  <li>Access to or availed insurance</li>\n  <li>On farm diversification (share of a single agricultural commodity not greater than 66% in the total value of production of the holding)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Access to credit and/or insurance is defined here as when a given service is available and the holder has enough means to obtain the service (required documents, collateral, positive credit history, etc.). Broadly, access to one or more the above 3 factors will allow the farm to prevent, resist, adapt and recover from external shocks such as, floods, droughts, market failure (e.g. price shock), climate shock and pest/animal diseases. </p>\n<p><strong>Sustainability criteria: </strong></p>\n<p>A farm holding is considered resilient if it has availed or has the means to access the risk mitigation mechanisms as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Green (desirable): Access to or availed at least two of the above-listed mitigation mechanisms.</li>\n  <li>Yellow (acceptable): Access to or availed at least one of the above-listed mitigation mechanisms.</li>\n  <li>Red (unsustainable): No access to the listed mitigation mechanisms. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Data items:</strong></p>\n<p>Reference period: last calendar year</p>\n<p>3.1. Agricultural holding access to or availed of credit, insurance or other financial instruments:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Credit (both formal and informal) </li>\n  <li>Insurance </li>\n</ul>\n<p>3.2 List of other on-farm activities apart from crops and livestock</p>\n<p>3.3 Value of output for the listed on-farm activities/commodities</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Prevalence of soil degradation</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension: </strong>Environmental<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Theme: </strong>Soil health </p>\n<p>Many of the processes affecting soil health are driven by agricultural practices. FAO and the Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils (ITPS) have identified 10 main threats to soil functions: soil erosion; soil organic carbon losses; nutrient imbalance; acidification; contamination; waterlogging; compaction; soil sealing; salinization and loss of soil biodiversity. </p>\n<p><strong>Coverage: </strong>All farms types<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong></p>\n<p>The sub-indicator measures the extent to which agriculture activities affects soil health and therefore represents a sustainability issue. A review of the 10 threats to soil shows that all except one (soil sealing, which is the loss of natural soil to construction/urbanisation) are potentially and primarily affected by inappropriate agricultural practices. Ideally, therefore, all soils under agricultural land area in a country should be the subject of periodic monitoring in order to assess the impact of agriculture on soils. This requires detailed surveys and sampling campaigns, associated with laboratory testing. In order to propose a manageable solution while capturing the main trends in the country in terms of soil health, the farm survey focuses on the four threats that combine the characteristics more widespread (for national monitoring, countries may choose to add any of the other areas indicated above, depending on relevance), and easier to assess through farm surveys:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Soil erosion</li>\n  <li>Reduction in soil fertility</li>\n  <li>Salinization of irrigated land</li>\n  <li>Waterlogging</li>\n  <li>Other - Specify</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The farm survey captures farmer&#x2019;s knowledge about the situation of the agricultural holding in terms of soil degradation. Experience has shown that farmers are very much aware of the state of their soils, health and degradation level. Farmers may also be offered the opportunity to mention other threats than the above four. </p>\n<p>Other data sources on soil health may either complement the information collected through the farm survey and offer opportunities for cross-checking farmers&#x2019; responses; or be used as alternative sources of data. Prior to the farm survey, a desk study could collect all available information on soil health, including using national official statistics or statistics available from international agencies such as FAO. This typically includes maps, models, results from soil sampling, laboratory analysis and field surveys, and all existing report on soil and land degradation at national level. On the basis of this information, maps or tables (by administrative boundaries or other divisions of the country) can be established, showing the threats to soils according to the above 4 categories of threats.</p>\n<p><strong>Sustainability criteria: </strong></p>\n<p>Proportion of agricultural area of the farm affected by soil degradation.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Green (desirable): The combined area affected by any of the four selected threats to soil health is negligible (less than 10% of the total agriculture area of the farm).</li>\n  <li>Yellow (acceptable): The combined area affected by any of the four selected threats to soil health is between 10% and 50% of the total agriculture area of the farm.</li>\n  <li>Red (unsustainable): The combined area affected by any of the four selected threats to soil health is above 50% of the total agriculture area of the farm.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Data items:</strong></p>\n<p>Reference period: last three calendar years</p>\n<p>4.1 List of soil degradation threats experienced on the holding</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Soil erosion (loss of topsoil through wind or water erosion)</li>\n      <li>Reduction in soil fertility<sup><a href=\"#footnote-8\" id=\"footnote-ref-8\">[7]</a></sup></li>\n      <li>Salinization of irrigated land</li>\n      <li>Waterlogging</li>\n      <li>Other &#x2013; Specify</li>\n      <li>None of the above</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>4.2 Total area of the holding affected by threats related to soil degradation</p>\n<h3><strong>5. Variation in water availability</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension:</strong> Environmental </p>\n<p><strong>Theme:</strong> Water use</p>\n<p>Agriculture, more specifically irrigated agriculture, is by far the main economic sector using freshwater resources. In many places, water withdrawal from rivers and groundwater aquifers is beyond what can be considered environmentally sustainable. This affects both rivers and underground aquifers. Sustainable agriculture therefore requires that that level of use of freshwater for irrigation remains within acceptable boundaries. While there are no internationally agreed standards of water use sustainability, signals associated with unsustainable use of water typically include progressive reduction in the level of groundwater, drying out of springs and rivers, increased conflicts among water users. </p>\n<p><strong>Coverage: </strong>All farm types<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong></p>\n<p>The sub-indicator captures the extent to which agriculture contributes to unsustainable patterns of water use. Ideally, the level of sustainability in water use is measured at the scale of the river basin or groundwater aquifer, as it is the combined effect of all users sharing the same resource that impact water sustainability. The farm survey captures farmers&#x2019; awareness and behaviour in relation with water scarcity, and associates them with three levels of sustainability. These awareness and behaviour are expressed in terms of:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>whether the farmer uses water to irrigate crops on at least 10% of the agriculture area of the farm and why, if the answer is negative (does not need, cannot afford);</li>\n  <li>whether the farmer is aware about issues of water availability in the area of the farm and notices a reduction in water availability over time;</li>\n  <li>whether there are organizations (water users organisations, others) in charge of allocating water among users and the extent to which these organisations are working effectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other data sources may either complement the farm survey on water use and offer opportunities for cross-checking farmers&#x2019; responses; or be used as alternative sources of data. Prior to the farm survey, a desk study should collect all available information on water balance, including national official statistics or statistics available from international agencies such as FAO. Information on water resources and use is usually collected by the entities in charge of water management or monitoring and are organised by hydrological entity (river basin or groundwater aquifer). They typically include hydrological records (river flow, groundwater levels), models and maps showing the extent of water use by hydrological entity.</p>\n<p><strong>Sustainability criteria: </strong></p>\n<p>Farm sustainability in relation with water use will be assessed as follows: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Green (desirable): Water availability remains stable over the years, for farms irrigating crops on more than 10% of the agriculture area of the farm. Default result for farms irrigating less than 10% of their agricultural area </li>\n  <li>Yellow (acceptable): uses water to irrigate crops on at least 10% of the agriculture area of the farm, does not know whether water availability remains stable over the years, or experiences reduction on water availability over the years, but there is an organisation that effectively allocates water among users. </li>\n  <li>Red (unsustainable): in all other cases. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Data items:</strong></p>\n<p>Reference period: last three calendar years</p>\n<p>5.1 Irrigated agricultural area of the holding </p>\n<p>5.2 Reduction in water availability experienced on the holding</p>\n<p>5.3 Existence of organizations dealing with water allocation </p>\n<h3><strong>6. Management of fertilizers</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension: </strong>Environmental<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Theme: </strong>Fertilizer pollution risk </p>\n<p>Agriculture can affect the quality of the environment through excessive use or inadequate management of fertilizers. Sustainable agriculture implies that the level of chemicals in soil and water bodies remains within acceptable thresholds. Integrated plant nutrient management considers all sources of nutrients (mineral and organic) and their management in order to obtain best nutrient balance. Measuring soil and water quality captures the extent and causes of pollution, but establishing monitoring systems of soil and water is costly and not always feasible in countries. </p>\n<p>Note: the management of plant nutrients addresses two sustainability issues: avoiding pollution, and maintaining a good level of soil fertility. This sub-indicator addresses the first issue, while the second one is addressed under sub-indicator 4 &#x2018;Soil health&#x2019;. </p>\n<p><strong>Coverage: </strong>All farm types</p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong></p>\n<p>The proposed approach is based on questions to farmers about their use of fertilizer, in particular mineral or synthetic fertilizers and animal manure, their awareness about the environmental risks associated with fertilizer and manure applications, and their behaviour in terms of plant nutrient management<sup><a href=\"#footnote-9\" id=\"footnote-ref-9\">[8]</a></sup>. Management measures considered to help reducing risk is as follows: </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Follow protocols as per extension service or retail outlet directions or local regulations, not exceeding recommended doses</li>\n  <li>Use organic source of nutrients (including manure or composting residues) alone, or in combination with synthetic or mineral fertilizers </li>\n  <li>Use legumes as a cover crop, or component of a multi/crop or pasture system to reduce fertilizer inputs</li>\n  <li>Distribute synthetic or mineral fertilizer application over the growing period</li>\n  <li>Consider soil type and climate<sup><a href=\"#footnote-10\" id=\"footnote-ref-10\">[9]</a></sup> in deciding fertilizer application doses and frequencies</li>\n  <li>Use soil sampling at least every 5 years to perform nutrient budget calculations </li>\n  <li>Perform site-specific nutrient management or precision farming<sup><a href=\"#footnote-11\" id=\"footnote-ref-11\">[10]</a></sup></li>\n  <li>Use buffer strips along water courses.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Sustainability criteria: </strong></p>\n<p>Farm sustainability in relation with fertilizer pollution risk will be assessed as follows: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Green (desirable): The farm takes specific measures to mitigate environmental risks (at least four from the list above). Default result for farms not using fertilizers<sup><a href=\"#footnote-12\" id=\"footnote-ref-12\">[11]</a></sup>. </li>\n  <li>Yellow (acceptable): The farm uses fertilizers and takes at least two measures from the above list to mitigate environmental risks</li>\n  <li>Red (unsustainable): The farm uses fertilizer and does not take any of the above specific measures to mitigate environmental risks associated with their use. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Data items:</strong></p>\n<p>Reference period: last calendar year</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>6.1 Use of synthetic or mineral fertilizer or animal manure/slurry by the agricultural holding (Y/N)</p>\n<p>6.2 Specific measures taken to mitigate the environmental risks associated with the excessive use or misuse use of fertilizers as per list below: </p>\n<p>&#x20DD; 1 Follow protocols as per extension service or retail outlet directions or local regulations, not exceeding recommended doses </p>\n<p>&#x20DD; 2 Use organic source of nutrients (including manure or composting residues) alone, or in combination with synthetic or mineral fertilizers</p>\n<p>&#x20DD; 3 Use legumes as a cover crop, or component of a multi/crop or pasture system to reduce fertilizer inputs </p>\n<p>&#x20DD; 4 Distribute synthetic or mineral fertilizer application over the growing period</p>\n<p>&#x20DD; 5 Consider soil type and climate in deciding fertilizer application doses and frequencies</p>\n<p>&#x20DD; 6 Use soil sampling at least every 5 years to perform nutrient budget calculations</p>\n<p>&#x20DD; 7 Perform site-specific nutrient management or precision farming</p>\n<p>&#x20DD; 8 Use buffer strips along water courses.</p>\n<h3><strong>7. Management of pesticides</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension: </strong>Environmental<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Theme: </strong>Pesticide risk</p>\n<p>Pesticides are important inputs in modern agriculture (crop and livestock), but if not well managed they can cause harm to people&#x2019;s health or to the environment. Practices associated with integrated pest management (IPM<sup><a href=\"#footnote-13\" id=\"footnote-ref-13\">[12]</a></sup>) exist that contribute to minimise risks associated with the use of pesticides and limit their impact on human health and on the environment. The International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management defines best practice in pesticide management.</p>\n<p><strong>Coverage: </strong>All farm types</p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong></p>\n<p>The proposed sub-indicator is based on information on the use of pesticides on the farms, the type of pesticide used and the type of measure(s) taken to mitigate the associated risks<sup><a href=\"#footnote-14\" id=\"footnote-ref-14\">[13]</a></sup>. It considers the possibility that the holding uses pesticides in the framework of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, or adopts specific measures to help reducing risks associated with pesticide use.

Use of agro-biodiversity-supportive practices</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension: </strong>Environmental<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Theme: </strong>Biodiversity </p>\n<p>The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) stresses the close relationship between agriculture activities and biodiversity, considering three levels of biodiversity: genetic level diversity; agrobiodiversity at production system level; and ecosystem level (wild) biodiversity. The way agriculture is practiced influences all three levels. Attempts to develop indicators of biodiversity for agriculture systematically consider a large number of sub-indicators, with no universally agreed sustainability criteria. Considering these constraints, and the importance of addressing biodiversity in the construction of Indicator 2.4.1, it is proposed to develop a sub-indicator that captures the efforts towards more sustainable agriculture that better contributes to biodiversity, by identifying a limited list of practices that are conducive to biodiversity conservation.</p>\n<p><strong>Coverage: </strong>All farm types<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong></p>\n<p>This sub-indicator measures the level of adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices that better contribute to biodiversity by the farm at ecosystem, species and genetic levels. This indicator addresses both crops and livestock. Specifically, in case of this sub-indicator the scope is the entire area of the farm holding as opposed to the agricultural area that is used for rest of the 10 sub-indicators. </p>\n<p>In particular, two separate scoring systems depending on the applicability of the organic farming criterion have been proposed.</p>\n<p>Depending on whether organic certification system exists, countries will select one of the below two proposed set of criteria and thus will be evaluated/scored differently in terms of their sustainability status. According to this formulation, to secure green status, farms in countries with organic certification in place, will have to check 3 out of 6 criteria. On the contrary, farms operating in countries with no organic certification in place, will have to check 2 out of 5 criteria for obtaining the green status.</p>\n<p>The detailed formulation of the criteria for the 2 scoring systems is described below:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Criteria for group of countries with organic certification systems/schemes:</strong></li>\n  <li>Leaves at least 10% of the holding area for natural or diverse vegetation. This can include natural pasture/grassland, maintaining wildflower strips, stone and wood heaps, trees or hedgerows, natural ponds or wetlands. </li>\n  <li>Farm produces agricultural products that are organically certified, or its products are undergoing the certification process. </li>\n  <li>Farm does not use medically important antimicrobials as growth promoters.</li>\n  <li>At least two of the following contribute to farm production: 1) temporary crops, 2) pasture, 3) permanent crops, 4) trees on farm, 5) livestock or animal products, and 6) aquaculture.</li>\n  <li>Practices crop or crop/pasture rotation involving at least 2 crops or crops and pastures on at least 80% of the farm agriculture area (excluding permanent crops and permanent pastures) over a period of 3 years.

It informs about economic risks faced by unskilled workers (those performing simple and routine tasks) in terms of remuneration received, the later benchmarked against the minimum wage set at national level in the agricultural sector. This sub-indicator allows distinguishing between holdings that pay a fair remuneration to its employees under the elementary occupation group, and agricultural holdings paying a remuneration to their employees belonging to the elementary occupation group that is below the minimum wage standard.

Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES)</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension: </strong>Social </p>\n<p><strong>Theme: </strong>Food security </p>\n<p>FIES is a metric of severity of food insecurity at the household level that relies on people&#x2019;s direct yes/no responses to eight simple questions regarding their access to adequate food. It is a statistical measurement scale similar to other widely-accepted statistical scales designed to measure unobservable traits such as aptitude/intelligence, personality, and a broad range of social, psychological and health-related conditions. </p>\n<p><strong>Coverage: </strong>Only household farms </p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong></p>\n<p>The Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) produces a measure of the severity of food insecurity experienced by individuals or households, based on direct interviews.</p>\n<p>The FIES questions refer to the experiences of the individual respondent or of the respondent&#x2019;s household as a whole. The questions focus on self-reported food-related behaviors and experiences associated with increasing difficulties in accessing food due to resource constraints. </p>\n<p>The FIES is derived from two widely-used experience-based food security scales: the U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module and the Latin American and Caribbean Food Security Scale (Spanish acronym ELCSA). It consists of a set of eight short yes/no questions asked directly to people. The questions focus on self-reported, food-related behaviours and experiences associated with increasing difficulties in accessing food due to resource constraints. The FIES is based on a well-grounded construct of the experience of food insecurity composed of three domains: uncertainty/anxiety, changes in food quality, and changes in food quantity.</p>\n<p>This sub-indicator is SDG indicator 2.1.2, contextualised for a farm survey. </p>\n<p><strong>Sustainability criteria: </strong>Level on FIES scale</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Green (desirable): Mild food insecurity<sup><a href=\"#footnote-18\" id=\"footnote-ref-18\">[17]</a></sup> </li>\n  <li>Yellow (acceptable)<sup><a href=\"#footnote-19\" id=\"footnote-ref-19\">[18]</a></sup>: Moderate food insecurity </li>\n  <li>Red (unsustainable): Severe food insecurity </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Data items:</strong></p>\n<p>Reference period: last 12 months</p>\n<p>10.1 The respondent&#x2019;s recollection that he/she (or any other adult in the household) would be worried about not having enough food to eat due to lack of money or other resources</p>\n<p>10.2 The respondent&#x2019;s recollection that he/she (or any adult in the household) was unable to eat healthy and nutritious food because of lack of money or other resources</p>\n<p>10.3 The respondent&#x2019;s recollection that he/she (or any adult in the household) only ate a few kinds of food due to lack of money or other resources</p>\n<p>10.4 The respondent&#x2019;s recollection that he/she (or any adult in the household) had to skip a meal because there was no enough money or other resources for food</p>\n<p>10.5 The respondent&#x2019;s recollection that he/she (or any adult in the household) ate less than he/she thought he should due to lack of money or other resources</p>\n<p>10.6 The respondent&#x2019;s recollection that his/her household ran out of food because of a lack of money or other resources</p>\n<p>10.7 The respondent&#x2019;s recollection that he/she (or any adult in the household) was hungry but not eating due to lack of money or other resources for food</p>\n<p>10.8 The respondent&#x2019;s recollection that he/she (or any adult in the household) did not eat for a whole day because of a lack of money or other resources</p>\n<h3><strong>11.

Valeur de la production agricole par hectare</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension : </strong>économique</p>\n<p><strong>Thème : </strong>productivité des terres</p>\n<p>La productivité des terres est une mesure de la valeur agricole des productions obtenues sur une superficie donnée. Le maintien ou l’amélioration de la production au fil du temps par rapport à la superficie des terres utilisées est un aspect important de la durabilité pour diverses raisons. Au niveau de l’exploitation, la productivité des terres reflète la technologie et les processus de production pour des conditions agro-écologiques données. Dans un sens plus large, une augmentation du niveau de productivité des terres permet une production plus élevée tout en réduisant la pression sur les ressources foncières de plus en plus rares, généralement liées à la déforestation et aux pertes associées de services écosystémiques et de biodiversité.</p>\n<p><strong>Couverture : </strong>tous les types d'exploitations agricoles</p>\n<p><strong>Description : </strong></p>\n<p>Le sous-indicateur est décrit comme la valeur de la production agricole par hectare (exploitations qui produisent des cultures et du bétail ou un mélange). Les informations sur les extrants des exploitations et les superficies agricoles devraient être des informations standard disponibles dans les enquêtes agricoles, fournissant ainsi une bonne base d’évaluation au niveau des exploitations. </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Valeur de la production agricole : le volume de la production agricole au niveau de l’exploitation tient généralement compte de la production de plusieurs produits, p. ex. les types de cultures et les combinaisons de cultures et de bétail, etc. Étant donné que le volume des productions agricoles n’est pas mesuré en unités proportionnelles (p. ex., toutes les productions ne sont pas mesurées en tonnes et les tonnes de productions différentes représentent des produits différents), il est nécessaire d’établir un moyen approprié d’agrégation, dans ce cas à l’aide d’une unité monétaire. Un moyen simple de permettre l’agrégation consiste à refléter les multiples extrants produits par une même exploitation en termes de valeurs (c.-à-d. la quantité multipliée par les prix). </li>\n  <li>Superficie des terres agricoles : définie comme la superficie des terres utilisées pour l’agriculture au sein de la ferme<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[2]</a></sup>. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Critères de durabilité : </strong></p>\n<p>Distance par rapport au 90<sup>e</sup> centile de la distribution nationale<sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-ref-4\">[3]</a></sup> :</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Vert (souhaitable) : la valeur du sous-indicateur est &#x2265; 2/3 du 90<sup>e</sup> centile correspondant</li>\n  <li>Jaune (acceptable) : la valeur du sous-indicateur est &#x2265; 1/3 et &lt; 2/3 du 90<sup>e</sup> centile correspondant</li>\n  <li>Rouge (non durable) : la valeur du sous-indicateur est &lt; 1/3 du 90<sup>e</sup> centile correspondant</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Éléments de données :</strong></p>\n<p>Période de référence : dernière année civile</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ol>\n      <li>Quantités et prix à la ferme (ou valeur de la production) des 5 principales cultures et/ou produits animaux et sous-produits produits par l’exploitation</li>\n      <li>Quantités et prix à la ferme (ou valeur de la production) d’autres produits agricoles (produits agroforestiers ou aquacoles, etc.) produits par l’exploitation</li>\n      <li>Superficie des terres agricoles de l’exploitation</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>2. Revenu agricole net</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension :</strong> économique</p>\n<p><strong>Thème :</strong> rentabilité</p>\n<p>Une partie importante de la durabilité de l’agriculture est la viabilité économique de l’exploitation, tirée dans une large mesure par sa rentabilité. La rentabilité est mesurée à l’aide du revenu net que l’agriculteur est en mesure de tirer des opérations agricoles. La disponibilité et l’utilisation de l’information sur la performance économique des exploitations agricoles, mesurée à l’aide de la rentabilité, favoriseront une meilleure prise de décision tant au niveau microéconomique que macro-économique. Étant donné que les mesures du rendement déterminent le comportement, une meilleure information sur le rendement peut modifier le comportement et la prise de décisions du gouvernement et des producteurs, tant dans l'agriculture commerciale à grande échelle que dans l'agriculture de subsistance à petite et moyenne échelle.</p>\n<p><strong>Couverture : </strong>tous les types d'exploitations agricoles</p>\n<p><strong>Description : </strong></p>\n<p>Le sous-indicateur mesure si l'exploitation est constamment rentable sur une période de trois ans. Ce sous-indicateur se concentre sur le revenu des opérations agricoles plutôt que sur le revenu total du ménage agricole, qui peut inclure d'autres sources de revenus comme, par exemple, l'emploi d'autres membres de la famille dans des entreprises locales, le tourisme, etc.</p>\n<p>Formule<sup><a href=\"#footnote-5\" id=\"footnote-ref-5\">[4]</a></sup>:</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi>R</mi>\n    <mi>A</mi>\n    <mi>N</mi>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>R</mi>\n    <mi>M</mi>\n    <mo>+</mo>\n    <msub>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>Y</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>k</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msub>\n    <mo>-</mo>\n    <mi>D</mi>\n    <mi>E</mi>\n    <mo>-</mo>\n    <mi>A</mi>\n    <mi>m</mi>\n    <mi>o</mi>\n    <mo>+</mo>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>V</mi>\n    <mi>V</mi>\n    <mi>S</mi>\n  </math></p>\n<p>où :</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>RAN = Revenu agricole net</li>\n  <li>RM = Recettes monétaires agricoles totales, y compris les paiements directs de programmes</li>\n  <li>Y<sub>k</sub> = Revenu en nature</li>\n  <li>DE = Dépenses totales d'exploitation après remises (y compris les coûts de la main-d'œuvre)</li>\n  <li>Amo = Amortissements</li>\n  <li>VVS = Valeur de la variation des stocks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Définitions :</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Le revenu agricole net désigne la rémunération (monétaire et non monétaire) des exploitants agricoles pour leur travail, leur gestion et leur capital, après paiement de toutes les dépenses de production (c'est-à-dire le revenu agricole brut moins les dépenses de production). Il comprend le revenu net de la production agricole, la valeur des produits consommés sur l'exploitation, la dépréciation et les variations de stocks.</li>\n  <li>Le revenu agricole brut désigne les revenus monétaires et non monétaires perçus par l'exploitation. Ses principales composantes comprennent les recettes monétaires provenant de la vente de produits agricoles, les paiements directs de programmes aux producteurs, les autres revenus agricoles (tels que les revenus du travail à forfait), la valeur des aliments et du carburant produits et consommés sur la même exploitation, et la variation de la valeur des stocks de fin d'année des cultures et du bétail<sup><a href=\"#footnote-6\" id=\"footnote-ref-6\">[5]</a></sup>.</li>\n  <li>Les recettes monétaires agricoles comprennent les recettes provenant de la vente de produits agricoles en unités monétaires locales qui incluent les ventes de cultures, de bétail et de ses sous-produits.</li>\n  <li>Les paiements directs de programmes aux producteurs inclus dans les recettes monétaires agricoles représentent les montants versés dans le cadre de divers programmes gouvernementaux et privés aux personnes impliquées dans la production agricole. Les paiements liés à la production agricole courante comprennent les subventions visant à encourager la production ou à compenser les producteurs pour les faibles rendements du marché, les paiements visant à stabiliser les revenus et les paiements visant à compenser les producteurs pour les pertes de récoltes ou de bétail causées par des conditions climatiques extrêmes, des maladies ou d'autres raisons et les paiements d'assurance.</li>\n  <li>Le revenu en nature mesure la valeur des biens agricoles produits dans les exploitations agricoles et consommés par les familles des exploitants agricoles. Il est inclus pour mesurer la production agricole totale.</li>\n  <li>Les dépenses d'exploitation représentent les coûts commerciaux encourus par les entreprises agricoles pour les biens et services utilisés dans le processus de production. Les dépenses comprennent à la fois les achats et la propre production, à savoir : les impôts fonciers, le travail à forfait, les semences, le loyer, les engrais et la chaux, les produits chimiques, les réparations des machines et des bâtiments, l'irrigation, le carburant pour le chauffage et les machines, les salaires, les intérêts et la part de l'entreprise dans les primes d'assurance.</li>\n  <li>Les charges d'amortissement tiennent compte de la dépréciation économique ou de la perte de la juste valeur marchande des immobilisations de l'entreprise agricole. Calculée sur les bâtiments agricoles, les machines agricoles et la part de l'entreprise agricole dans les automobiles, les camions et la maison de ferme, la dépréciation est généralement considérée comme le résultat du vieillissement, de l'usure et de l'obsolescence. Elle représente une diminution des avantages économiques potentiels qui peuvent être générés par l'immobilisation.</li>\n  <li>La valeur de la variation des stocks (VVS) mesure la valeur monétaire de la variation physique des stocks appartenant aux producteurs. Ce concept est utilisé pour évaluer la production économique agricole totale. Pour calculer la VIC, la variation des stocks appartenant aux producteurs (entre la fin et le début d'une année civile) est d'abord calculée, puis multipliée par les prix annuels moyens des cultures ou la valeur par animal. Ce calcul est différent de l'approche de la valeur comptable financière ou comptable, qui évalue les stocks de début et de fin, puis en déduit la variation.</li>\n  <li>La VVS pour tous les principaux produits de base peut varier considérablement (en fonction de l'ampleur de la variation des stocks et des prix). La VVS peut être positive (lorsque les stocks sont plus importants à la fin de l'année par rapport aux niveaux du début de l'année) ou négative (lorsque les stocks de fin d'année sont inférieurs aux niveaux du début de l'année). Si les niveaux de stocks sont les mêmes au début et à la fin de l'année, la VVS sera nulle malgré les variations de prix.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>L'estimation de la rentabilité au niveau d'une exploitation agricole nécessite généralement la compilation des registres financiers de base de l'exploitation, c.-à-d. les transactions quotidiennes, hebdomadaires, mensuelles ou saisonnières de manière organisée. En général, les grandes exploitations commerciales tiennent des registres financiers détaillés, mais dans le cas des exploitations d'agriculture de subsistance à moyenne et petite échelle, la tenue de registres est rarement pratiquée et dans la plupart des pays, elle n'existe pas du tout.</p>\n<p>Dans le cas où des données détaillées ne sont pas disponibles au niveau de l'exploitation, les estimations seront calculées sur la base des déclarations des agriculteurs concernant les quantités et les prix des produits et des intrants. Dans ces cas, la dépréciation, la variation des stocks et les taxes peuvent être négligées. Ceci est décrit ci-dessous comme l'option simplifiée (1).</p>\n<p>Une option simplifiée (2) est également proposée, basée sur la déclaration de l'agriculteur concernant la rentabilité de l'exploitation agricole au cours des trois dernières années civiles. Il est recommandé d'utiliser cette option simplifiée uniquement lorsque les deux autres options ne sont pas réalisables.</p>\n<p><strong>Critères de durabilité : </strong></p>\n<p>Pour qu'une exploitation agricole soit rentable, le revenu agricole net doit être plus grand que zéro.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Vert (souhaitable) : plus grand que zéro pour les trois dernières années consécutives</li>\n  <li>Jaune (acceptable) : plus grand que zéro pour au moins une des trois dernières années consécutives</li>\n  <li>Rouge (non durable) : plus petit que zéro pour l'ensemble des trois dernières années consécutives</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Éléments de données :</strong></p>\n<p>Période de référence : les trois dernières années civiles</p>\n<p><strong><em>Option recommandée :</em></strong></p>\n<p>Les données des registres financiers de l'exploitation, c.-à-d. les transactions quotidiennes, hebdomadaires, mensuelles ou saisonnières, sont recueillies de manière organisée (en général, les grandes exploitations commerciales tiennent des registres financiers détaillés sur la base desquels le NFI peut être calculé selon l'équation ci-dessus).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Option simplifiée (1) :</em></strong></p>\n<p>À utiliser lorsque les données détaillées ne sont pas disponibles au niveau de l'exploitation (mieux adaptée aux petits exploitants et au secteur des ménages).</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Quantité produite (c.-à-d. les cultures et le bétail, ainsi que leurs produits et sous-produits, destinés au marché ou à l'autoconsommation)</li>\n  <li>Prix à la ferme des quantités produites ci-dessus</li>\n  <li>Frais d'exploitation, y compris les quantités d'intrants et leurs prix de marché</li>\n  <li>Quantité/rendement des autres activités menées dans l'exploitation et/ou des produits fabriqués dans l'exploitation, p. ex. l'aquaculture, l'agroforesterie et autres</li>\n  <li>Prix à la ferme des autres activités/ produits de base de l'exploitation</li>\n  <li>Quantités et prix des intrants utilisés pour produire d'autres extrants sur l'exploitation</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong><em>Option simplifiée (2) :</em></strong></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Déclaration du répondant sur la rentabilité de l'exploitation agricole au cours des 3 dernières années civiles</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong>3. Mécanismes d'atténuation des risques</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension : </strong>économique</p>\n<p><strong>Thème : </strong>résilience</p>\n<p>La résilience englobe les capacités d'absorption, d'anticipation et d'adaptation et se réfère aux propriétés d'un système qui permet aux exploitations de faire face aux chocs et aux stress, de persister et de continuer à bien fonctionner (dans le sens de fournir de la stabilité, des règles prévisibles, de la sécurité et d'autres avantages à ses membres).</p>\n<p><strong>Couverture : </strong>tous les types d'exploitations agricoles</p>\n<p><strong>Description : </strong></p>\n<p>Ce sous-indicateur mesure l'incidence des mécanismes d'atténuation suivants : </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Accès au crédit ou recours au crédit<sup><a href=\"#footnote-7\" id=\"footnote-ref-7\">[6]</a></sup></li>\n  <li>Accès à l'assurance ou recours à celle-ci</li>\n  <li>Diversification au sein de l'exploitation (part d'un seul produit agricole ne dépassant pas 66% de la valeur totale de la production de l'exploitation)</li>\n<p>L'accès au crédit et/ou à l'assurance est défini ici comme la disponibilité d'un service donné et le fait que le détenteur dispose de moyens suffisants pour obtenir ce service (documents requis, garanties, antécédents de crédit positifs, etc.). En général, l'accès à un ou plusieurs des trois facteurs ci-dessus permettra à l'exploitation de prévenir, de résister, de s'adapter et de se remettre des chocs externes tels que les inondations, les sécheresses, les défaillances du marché (p. ex., les chocs de prix), les chocs climatiques et les maladies animales. </p>\n<p><strong>Critère de durabilité : </strong></p>\n<p>Une exploitation agricole est considérée comme résiliente si elle a utilisé ou a les moyens d'accéder aux mécanismes d'atténuation des risques comme suit :</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Vert (souhaitable) : Accès ou utilisation d'au moins deux des mécanismes d'atténuation des risques énumérés ci-dessus.</li>\n  <li>Jaune (acceptable) : Accès ou utilisation d'au moins un des mécanismes d'atténuation énumérés ci-dessus.</li>\n  <li>Rouge (non durable) : Aucun accès aux mécanismes d'atténuation énumérés.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Éléments de données :</strong></p>\n<p>Période de référence : dernière année civile</p>\n<p>3.1.

Prévalence de détérioration des sols</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension : </strong>environnementale</p>\n<p><strong>Thème : </strong>santé des sols </p>\n<p>De nombreux processus affectant la santé des sols sont déterminés par les pratiques agricoles. La FAO et le Groupe technique intergouvernemental sur les sols (ITPS) ont identifié 10 menaces principales pour les fonctions du sol : érosion du sol, pertes de carbone organique du sol, déséquilibre des nutriments, acidification, contamination, engorgement, compactage, imperméabilisation du sol, salinisation et perte de biodiversité du sol. </p>\n<p><strong>Couverture : </strong>tous les types d'exploitations agricoles </p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong></p>\n<p>Ce sous-indicateur mesure la mesure dans laquelle les activités agricoles affectent la santé des sols et représente donc un problème de durabilité. L'examen des dix menaces pesant sur les sols montre que toutes sauf une (l'imperméabilisation des sols, qui est la perte de sols naturels au profit de la construction/urbanisation) sont potentiellement et principalement affectées par des pratiques agricoles inappropriées. Dans l'idéal, il faudrait donc que tous les sols situés sous la surface agricole d'un pays fassent l'objet d'une surveillance périodique afin d'évaluer l'impact de l'agriculture sur les sols. Cela nécessite des enquêtes et des campagnes d'échantillonnage détaillées, associées à des tests en laboratoire. Afin de proposer une solution gérable tout en capturant les principales tendances du pays en termes de santé des sols, l'enquête agricole se concentre sur les quatre menaces qui combinent les caractéristiques les plus répandues (pour la surveillance nationale, les pays peuvent choisir d'ajouter l'un des autres domaines indiqués ci-dessus, en fonction de la pertinence), et les plus faciles à évaluer par le biais des enquêtes agricoles :</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Érosion des sols</li>\n  <li>Réduction de la fertilité du sol</li>\n  <li>Salinisation des terres irriguées</li>\n  <li>Engorgement</li>\n  <li>Autre – Précisez </li>\n</ol>\n<p>L'enquête agricole permet de saisir les connaissances des agriculteurs sur la situation de l'exploitation agricole en termes de dégradation des sols. L'expérience a montré que les agriculteurs sont très conscients de l'état de leurs sols, de leur santé et de leur niveau de dégradation. Les agriculteurs peuvent également avoir l'opportunité de mentionner d'autres menaces que les quatre ci-dessus.</p>\n<p>D'autres sources de données sur la santé des sols peuvent soit compléter les informations collectées par l'enquête agricole et offrir des possibilités de recoupement des réponses des agriculteurs, soit être utilisées comme sources alternatives de données. Avant l'enquête agricole, une étude documentaire pourrait recueillir toutes les informations disponibles sur la santé des sols, notamment en utilisant les statistiques officielles nationales ou les statistiques disponibles auprès d'agences internationales telles que la FAO. Il s'agit généralement de cartes, de modèles, de résultats d'échantillonnage des sols, d'analyses en laboratoire et d'enquêtes sur le terrain, ainsi que de tous les rapports existants sur la détérioration des sols et des terres au niveau national. Sur la base de ces informations, des cartes ou des tableaux (selon les frontières administratives ou d'autres divisions du pays) peuvent être établis, montrant les menaces pesant sur les sols selon les 4 catégories de menaces ci-dessus.</p>\n<p><strong>Critères de durabilité : </strong></p>\n<p>Proportion de la surface agricole de l'exploitation affectée par la détérioration des sols.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Vert (souhaitable) : La superficie combinée affectée par l'une des quatre menaces sélectionnées pour la santé des sols est négligeable (moins de 10% de la surface agricole totale de l'exploitation).</li>\n  <li>Jaune (acceptable) : La superficie combinée affectée par l'une des quatre menaces sélectionnées pour la santé des sols se situe entre 10 % et 50 % de la superficie agricole totale de l'exploitation.</li>\n  <li>Rouge (non durable) : La superficie combinée affectée par l'une des quatre menaces sélectionnées pour la santé des sols est supérieure à 50 % de la superficie agricole totale de l'exploitation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Éléments de données :</strong></p>\n<p>Période de référence : trois dernières années civiles</p>\n<p>4.1 Liste des menaces de détérioration des sols subies par l'exploitation</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Érosion du sol (perte de la couche arable par érosion éolienne ou hydrique)</li>\n  <li>Réduction de la fertilité des sols<sup><a href=\"#footnote-8\" id=\"footnote-ref-8\">[7]</a></sup></li>\n  <li>Salinisation des terres irriguées</li>\n  <li>Engorgement</li>\n  <li>Autre – Précisez</li>\n  <li>Aucun des éléments ci-dessus</li>\n</ol>\n<p>4.2 Surface totale de l'exploitation affectée par des menaces liées à la dégradation du sol</p>\n<h3><strong>5. Variation de la disponibilité en eau</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension : </strong>environnementale </p>\n <p><strong>Thème : </strong>utilisation de l'eau </p>\n<p>L'agriculture, et plus particulièrement l'agriculture irriguée, est de loin le principal secteur économique utilisant les ressources en eau douce. Dans de nombreux endroits, le prélèvement d'eau dans les rivières et les aquifères souterrains dépasse ce qui peut être considéré comme écologiquement durable. Cette situation affecte à la fois les rivières et les aquifères souterrains. L'agriculture durable exige donc que ce niveau d'utilisation de l'eau douce pour l'irrigation reste dans des limites acceptables. Bien qu'il n'existe pas de normes internationalement reconnues en matière d'utilisation durable de l'eau, les signaux associés à une utilisation non durable de l'eau comprennent généralement la réduction progressive du niveau des eaux souterraines, l'assèchement des sources et des rivières, l'augmentation des conflits entre les utilisateurs d'eau.</p>\n<p><strong>Couverture : </strong>tous les types d'exploitations agricoles</p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong></p>\n<p>Ce sous-indicateur saisit la mesure dans laquelle l'agriculture contribue à des modèles non durables d'utilisation de l'eau. Idéalement, le niveau de durabilité de l'utilisation de l'eau est mesuré à l'échelle du bassin fluvial ou de l'aquifère d'eau souterraine, car c'est l'effet combiné de tous les utilisateurs partageant la même ressource qui a un impact sur la durabilité de l'eau. L'enquête agricole saisit la conscience et le comportement des agriculteurs par rapport à la pénurie d'eau, et les associe à trois niveaux de durabilité. Cette prise de conscience et ce comportement sont exprimés en termes de :</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>si l'agriculteur utilise l'eau pour irriguer les cultures sur au moins 10% de la surperficie agricole de l'exploitation et pourquoi, si la réponse est négative (n'en a pas besoin, ne peut se le permettre);</li>\n  <li>si l'agriculteur est conscient des problèmes de disponibilité de l'eau dans la zone de l'exploitation et s'il remarque une réduction de la disponibilité de l'eau au fil du temps;</li>\n  <li>s'il existe des organisations (organisations d'utilisateurs d'eau, autres) chargées de répartir l'eau entre les utilisateurs et dans quelle mesure ces organisations fonctionnent efficacement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>D'autres sources de données peuvent soit compléter l'enquête agricole à propos de l'utilisation de l'eau et offrir des possibilités de recoupement des réponses des agriculteurs, soit être utilisées comme sources alternatives de données. Avant l'enquête agricole, une étude documentaire doit recueillir toutes les informations disponibles sur le bilan hydrique, y compris les statistiques officielles nationales ou les statistiques disponibles auprès d'agences internationales telles que la FAO. Les informations sur les ressources en eau et leur utilisation sont généralement recueillies par les entités chargées de la gestion ou de la surveillance de l'eau et sont organisées par entité hydrologique (bassin fluvial ou aquifère souterrain). Elles comprennent généralement des relevés hydrologiques (débit des cours d'eau, niveaux des eaux souterraines), des modèles et des cartes montrant l'étendue de l'utilisation de l'eau par entité hydrologique.</p>\n<p><strong>Critères de durabilité : </strong></p>\n<p>La durabilité de l'exploitation agricole par rapport à l'utilisation de l'eau sera évaluée comme suit : </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Vert (souhaitable) : la disponibilité de l'eau reste stable au fil des ans, pour les exploitations irriguant des cultures sur plus de 10 % de la surperficie agricole de l'exploitation. Résultat par défaut pour les exploitations qui irriguent moins de 10 % de leur surperficie agricole.</li>\n  <li>Jaune (acceptable) : utilise l'eau pour irriguer des cultures sur au moins 10 % de la superficie agricole de l'exploitation, ne sait pas si la disponibilité de l'eau reste stable au fil des ans, ou connaît une réduction de la disponibilité de l'eau au fil des ans, mais il existe une organisation qui répartit efficacement l'eau entre les utilisateurs.</li>\n  <li>Rouge (non durable) : dans tous les autres cas.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Éléments de données :</strong></p>\n<p>Période de référence : les trois dernières années civiles</p>\n<p>5.1 Superficie agricole irriguée de l'exploitation</p>\n<p>5.2 Réduction de la disponibilité de l'eau subie par l'exploitation</p>\n<p>5.3 Existence d'organisations s'occupant de l'allocation de l'eau </p>\n<h3><strong>6. Gestion des engrais</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension : </strong>environnementale</p>\n<p><strong>Thème : </strong>risque de pollution par les engrais</p>\n<p>L'agriculture peut affecter la qualité de l'environnement par une utilisation excessive ou une gestion inadéquate des engrais. L'agriculture durable implique que le niveau des produits chimiques dans le sol et dans les masses d'eau reste dans des seuils acceptables. La gestion intégrée des nutriments végétaux prend en compte toutes les sources de nutriments (minéraux et organiques) et leur gestion afin d'obtenir le meilleur équilibre nutritif. La mesure de la qualité des sols et de l'eau permet de connaître l'étendue et les causes de la pollution, mais la mise en place de systèmes de surveillance des sols et de l'eau est coûteuse et n'est pas toujours réalisable dans les pays. </p>\n<p>Note : la gestion des éléments nutritifs des plantes aborde deux questions de durabilité : éviter la pollution et maintenir un bon niveau de fertilité des sols.

Utilisation de pratiques propices à l'agro-biodiversité</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension : </strong>environnementale</p>\n<p><strong>Thème : </strong>biodiversité </p>\n<p>La Convention sur la diversité biologique (CDB) souligne la relation étroite entre les activités agricoles et la biodiversité, en considérant trois niveaux de biodiversité : la diversité au niveau génétique; l'agrobiodiversité au niveau du système de production; et la biodiversité au niveau de l'écosystème (sauvage). La façon dont l'agriculture est pratiquée influence ces trois niveaux. Les tentatives de développement d'indicateurs de biodiversité pour l'agriculture considèrent systématiquement un grand nombre de sous-indicateurs, sans critères de durabilité universellement reconnus. Compte tenu de ces contraintes, et de l'importance d'aborder la biodiversité dans la construction de l'indicateur 2.4.1, il est proposé de développer un sous-indicateur qui reflète les efforts vers une agriculture plus durable qui contribue mieux à la biodiversité, en identifiant une liste limitée de pratiques qui sont favorables à la conservation de la biodiversité.</p>\n<p><strong>Couverture : </strong>tous les types d'exploitations agricoles</p>\n<p><strong>Description : </strong></p>\n<p>Ce sous-indicateur mesure le niveau d'adoption de pratiques agricoles plus durables qui contribuent davantage à la biodiversité de l'exploitation aux niveaux de l'écosystème, des espèces et de la génétique. Cet indicateur concerne à la fois les cultures et le bétail. Plus précisément, dans le cas de ce sous-indicateur, le champ d'application est l'ensemble de la zone de l'exploitation agricole, par opposition à la zone agricole qui est utilisée pour les 10 autres sous-indicateurs. </p>\n<p>En particulier, deux systèmes de notation distincts en fonction de l'applicabilité du critère de l'agriculture biologique ont été proposés.</p>\n<p>Selon l'existence ou non d'un système de certification biologique, les pays choisiront l'un des deux ensembles de critères proposés ci-dessous et seront donc évalués/notés différemment en termes de leur statut de durabilité. Selon cette formulation, pour obtenir le statut vert, les exploitations des pays ayant mis en place une certification biologique devront satisfaire 3 des 6 critères. Au contraire, les exploitations opérant dans des pays où aucune certification biologique n'est en place, devront satisfaire 2 des 5 critères pour obtenir le statut vert.</p>\n<p>La formulation détaillée des critères pour les 2 systèmes de notation est décrite ci-dessous :</p>\n<p><strong>Critères pour le groupe de pays ayant des systèmes de certification biologique :</strong></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>L'exploitation laisse au moins 10% de sa superficie agricole à la végétation naturelle ou diversifiée.

La FIES est basée sur une construction bien fondée de l'expérience de l'insécurité alimentaire composée de trois domaines : incertitude/anxiété, changements dans la qualité de la nourriture et changements dans la quantité de nourriture.</p>\n<p>Ce sous-indicateur est l'indicateur 2.1.2 des ODD, contextualisé pour une enquête agricole. </p>\n<p><strong>Critères de durabilité : </strong></p>\n<p>Niveau sur l'échelle FIES</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Vert (souhaitable) : insécurité alimentaire légère<sup><a href=\"#footnote-18\" id=\"footnote-ref-18\">[17]</a></sup></li> \n  <li>Jaune (acceptable)<sup><a href=\"#footnote-19\" id=\"footnote-ref-19\">[18]</a></sup> : insécurité alimentaire modérée </li>\n  <li>Rouge (non durable) : insécurité alimentaire grave </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Éléments de données :</strong></p>\n<p>Période de référence : 12 derniers mois</p>\n<p>10.1 Le répondant se souvient qu'il/elle (ou tout autre adulte du ménage) s'est inquiété(e) de ne pas avoir assez à manger par manque d'argent ou d'autres ressources</p>\n<p>10.2 Le répondant se souvient qu'il/elle (ou tout adulte du ménage) n'a pas pu manger des aliments sains et nutritifs par manque d'argent ou d'autres ressources</p>\n<p>10.3 Le répondant se souvient qu'il/elle (ou tout adulte dans le ménage) n'a mangé que quelques types d'aliments par manque d'argent ou d'autres ressources</p>\n<p>10.4 Le répondant se souvient qu'il/elle (ou tout adulte dans le ménage) a dû sauter un repas parce qu'il n'y avait pas assez d'argent ou d'autres ressources pour la nourriture</p>\n<p>10.5 Le répondant se souvient qu'il/elle (ou tout adulte du ménage) a mangé moins qu'il/elle ne pensait qu'il/elle devrait en raison du manque d'argent ou d'autres ressources</p>\n<p>10.6 Le répondant se souvient que son ménage a manqué de nourriture à cause d'un manque d'argent ou d'autres ressources</p>\n<p>10.7 Le répondant se souvient qu'il/elle (ou tout adulte du ménage) a eu faim mais n'a pas mangé à cause du manque d'argent ou d'autres ressources pour la nourriture</p>\n<p>10.8 Le répondant se souvient qu'il/elle (ou tout adulte du ménage) n'a pas mangé pendant toute une journée en raison d'un manque d'argent ou d'autres ressources</p>\n<h3><strong>11. Droits fonciers sûrs (garantis)</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension: </strong>sociale </p>\n<p><strong>Thème: </strong>occupation des terres </p>\n<p>Ce sous-indicateur permet d'évaluer la durabilité en termes de droits d'utilisation des terres agricoles. Les terres agricoles étant un intrant clé pour la production agricole, le fait de disposer de droits sûrs sur les terres garantit que l'exploitation agricole contrôle cet actif clé et ne risque pas de perdre les terres utilisées par l'exploitation pour l'agriculture. </p>\n<p>Il est prouvé que les agriculteurs ont tendance à être moins productifs s'ils ont un accès et un contrôle limités aux ressources et services économiques, en particulier la terre. Les inégalités de longue date en matière de ressources économiques et financières ont désavantagé certains agriculteurs par rapport à d'autres dans leur capacité à participer, à contribuer et à bénéficier de processus de développement plus larges. </p>\n<p>Ainsi, une distribution adéquate des ressources économiques, en particulier des terres, permet d'assurer une croissance économique équitable, contribue à l'efficacité économique et a un impact positif sur les résultats clés du développement, notamment la réduction de la pauvreté, la sécurité alimentaire et le bien-être des ménages.</p>\n<p>Ce sous-indicateur est l'indicateur 5.a.1 des ODD, adapté à l'indicateur 2.4.1 des ODD. </p>\n<p><strong>Couverture : </strong>tous les types d'exploitations agricoles</p>\n<p><strong>Description : </strong> </p>\n<p>Le sous-indicateur mesure la propriété ou les droits sécurisés sur l'utilisation des surperficies de terres agricoles en utilisant les critères suivants :</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Document officiel délivré par le registre foncier/l'agence cadastrale </li>\n  <li>Nom du titulaire figurant comme propriétaire/titulaire du droit d'utilisation sur les documents légalement reconnus</li>\n  <li>Droits de vendre l'une des parcelles de l'exploitation</li>\n  <li>Droits de léguer une partie quelconque de la parcelle de l'exploitation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Critères de durabilité : </strong></p>\n<p>Niveau de sécurité de l'accès à la terre.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Vert (souhaitable) : dispose d'un document officiel portant le nom du détenteur/de l'exploitation, ou a le droit de vendre une partie de la parcelle de l'exploitation, ou a le droit de léguer une partie de la parcelle de l'exploitation</li>\n  <li>Jaune (acceptable) : possède un document formel même si le nom de l'exploitant/de l'exploitation n'y figure pas</li>\n  <li>Rouge (non durable) : aucune réponse positive à aucune des 4 questions ci-dessus</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Éléments de données :</strong></p>\n<p>Période de référence : dernière année civile</p>\n<p>11.1 Type de document officiel pour toute terre agricole de l'exploitant/exploitation qu'il détient (alternativement posséder, utiliser, occuper) délivré par le registre foncier/l'agence cadastrale</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Titre de propriété </li>\n  <li>Certificat de tenure coutumière </li>\n  <li>Certificat d'occupation </li>\n  <li>Testament enregistré ou certificat enregistré d'acquisitions héréditaires </li>\n  <li>Certificat enregistré de bail à perpétuité / à long terme </li>\n  <li>Contrat de location enregistré </li>\n  <li>Autre </li>\n</ol>\n<p>11.2 Nom de tout membre de l'exploitation figurant comme propriétaire ou détenteur de droit d'usage sur l'un des documents légalement reconnus</p>\n<p>11.3 Le droit de l'exploitant/de l'exploitation de vendre l'une des parcelles de l'exploitation </p>\n<p>11.4 Le droit de l'exploitant/de l'exploitation de léguer une partie quelconque de la parcelle de l'exploitation </p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"> <div> <sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-3\">2 </sup> <p> Selon la classification SEEA-AFF et la classification du recensement agricole mondial 2020 <a href=\"#footnote-ref-3\">&#x2191;</a></p></div>\n<div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-4\">3</sup><p> Le 90<sup>ème</sup> percentile et les seuils respectifs de 1/3 et 2/3 de la productivité sont calculés par système de production principal (cultures, animaux, ou un mélange de cultures et d'animaux ou, si possible, par grandes régions agricoles du pays).
