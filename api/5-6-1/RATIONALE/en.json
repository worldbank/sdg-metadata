{"status":"success","message":"The RATIONALE field for indicator 5-6-1, translated into en","data":"<p>Women&#x2019;s and girls&#x2019; autonomy in decision-making about sexual and reproductive health services, contraceptive use, and consensual sexual relations is key to their empowerment and the complete exercise of their reproductive rights. </p>\n<p>Women who make their own decision regarding seeking healthcare for themselves are considered empowered to exercise their reproductive rights.</p>\n<p>Regarding decision-making on the use of contraception, a clearer understanding of women empowerment is obtained by looking at the indicator from the perspective of decisions being made &#x201C;mainly by the partner&#x201D;, as opposed to a decision being made &#x201C;by the woman alone&#x201D; or &#x201C;by the woman jointly with the partner&#x201D;. Depending on the type of contraceptive method being used, a decision by the woman &#x201C;alone&#x201D; or &#x201C;jointly with the partner&#x201D; does not always entail that the woman is empowered or has bargaining skills. Conversely, it is safe to assume that a woman that does not participate, at all, in making contraceptive choices is disempowered as far as sexual and reproductive decisions are concerned. </p>\n<p>A woman&#x2019;s ability to say no to her husband/partner if she does not want to have sexual intercourse is well aligned with the concept of sexual autonomy and women&#x2019;s empowerment.</p>"}
