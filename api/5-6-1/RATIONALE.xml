			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Women&amp;#x2019;s and girls&amp;#x2019; autonomy in decision making about sexual and reproductive health services, contraceptive use and consensual sexual relations is key to their empowerment and the full exercise of their reproductive rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women who make their own decision regarding seeking healthcare for themselves are considered empowered to exercise their reproductive rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding decision-making on use of contraception, a clearer understanding of women empowerment is obtained by looking at the indicator from the perspective of decisions being made &amp;#x201C;mainly by the partner&amp;#x201D;, as opposed to decision being made &amp;#x201C;by the woman alone&amp;#x201D; or &amp;#x201C;by the woman jointly with the partner&amp;#x201D;. Depending in the type of contraceptive method being used, a decision by the woman &amp;#x201C;alone&amp;#x201D; or &amp;#x201C;jointly with the partner&amp;#x201D; does not always entail that the woman is empowered or has bargaining skills. Conversely, it is safe to assume that a woman that does not participate, at all, in making contraceptive choices is disempowered as far as sexual and reproductive decisions are concerned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman&amp;#x2019;s ability to say no to her husband/partner if she does not want to have sexual intercourse is well aligned with the concept of sexual autonomy and women&amp;#x2019;s empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;
