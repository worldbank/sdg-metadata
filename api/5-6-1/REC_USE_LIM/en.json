In the phase of the national Demographic and Health Survey (DHS&#x2013;7) and later rounds, as well as in other data collection instruments including the MICS and GGS, the questionnaire are extended to respondents whether they are using contraception or not. The measure does not cover women and girls that are not married or in union, as they do not usually make &#x201C;joint decisions&#x201D; on their own health care with their partners.</p>\n<p>As of early 2021, a total of 64 countries, the majority in sub-Saharan Africa, have at least one survey with data on all three questions necessary for calculating Indicator 5.6.1. Broader data sources are needed and efforts to increase data coverage are underway. </p>\n<p>In many national contexts, household surveys, which are the main data source for this indicator, exclude the homeless and are likely to under-enumerate linguistic or religious minority groups.</p>"}
