	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 5-6-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the indicator captured results for married and in-union women and adolescent girls of reproductive age (15&amp;#x2013;49 years old) &lt;u&gt;who are using any type of contraception&lt;/u&gt;. In the phase of the national Demographic and Health Survey (DHS&amp;#x2013;7) and later rounds, as well as in other data collection instruments including the MICS and GGS, the questionnaire is extended to respondents whether they are using contraception or not. The measure does not cover women and girls that are not married or in a union, as they do not usually make &amp;#x201C;joint decisions&amp;#x201D; on their health care with their partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of early 2022, a total of 64 countries, the majority in sub-Saharan Africa, have at least one survey with data on all three questions necessary for calculating Indicator 5.6.1. 28 countries have at least 2 data points between 2006 and 2020. Broader data sources are needed, and efforts to increase data coverage are underway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many national contexts, household surveys, which are the main data source for this indicator, exclude the homeless and are likely to under-enumerate linguistic or religious minority groups.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
