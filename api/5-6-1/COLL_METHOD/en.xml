	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 5-6-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data is collected in line with the methodology used for the relevant national survey. Data for SDG indicator 5.6.1 may be collected through existing country-specific surveys. For existing national household surveys, it must be ascertained that the sampling design does not systematically exclude subgroups of the population that are important to SDG 5.6.1, specifically, women of reproductive age (15-49) that are currently married or in a union. Surveys that cover only certain population subgroups, such as women who speak the dominant language or women from the main ethnic group, may exclude the experiences of many women. Data on the ethnicity and religion of the survey participants should be collected whenever available. The survey should have a large sample size (usually between 5,000 and 30,000 households), be nationally representative, and be representative, at least, at one administrative level below the national level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surveys on unrelated topics may not be good candidates for the incorporation of the SDG 5.6.1 questions. The sensitivity of the topics addressed in health surveys those examining women&amp;#x2019;s health, makes them a feasible instrument for incorporating questions on women&amp;#x2019;s experience of decision making in health care, use of contraceptives, and sexual relations for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To generate data for SDG 5.6.1, all three questions must be included in the survey. The three questions in the Definition section provide generic questions that can be used in country-specific surveys. The first and the second questions should include distinct categories for women making decisions themselves, and women making decisions jointly with their husband/partner. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
