	<data>&lt;p&gt;Adopted by 179 governments, the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development Programme of Action marked a fundamental shift in global thinking on population and development issues. It moved away from a focus on reaching specific demographic targets to a focus on the needs, aspirations and rights of individual women and men. The Programme of Action asserted that everyone counts, that the true focus of development policy must be the improvement of individual lives and the measure of progress should be the extent to which we address inequalities.
