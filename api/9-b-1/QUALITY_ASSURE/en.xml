	<message>The QUALITY_ASSURE field for indicator 9-b-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/unsystem/Documents/QAF-UNIDO.pdf&quot;&gt;The UNIDO Quality Assurance Framework&lt;/a&gt; is followed to ensure that the statistical activities of UNIDO are relevant and the data compiled and disseminated are accurate, complete within the defined scope and coverage, timely, comparable in terms of internationally recommended methods and classification standards and internally coherent to variables included in the datasets. While these generally accepted, broad dimensions of quality of statistical data may be defined in each NSO&amp;apos;s own quality assurance framework. UNIDO makes maximum effort that data produced from the statistical operation undertaken with the UNIDO technical cooperation are accurate, internationally comparable and coherent.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
