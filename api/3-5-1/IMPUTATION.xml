&lt;p&gt;For drug use disorder, data will be provided for countries where information is available for both numerator and denominator. No data estimates will be done at the national level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For alcohol, when information on service utilization is missing in a country, several approaches will be used to produce estimates based on all available pieces of contextual service capacity data in the country and regionally. Link to be established between service availability and service utilization to get rough understanding on number of people who might be using services for countries where no direct information on number of people using services is available at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At regional and global level &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sub-regional and regional aggregates are produced when enough data at the country level are available (a minimum number of countries and a minimum percentage of population coverage). When data are available, sub-regional estimates are created first and then aggregated at regional level. The global level is computed as aggregation of regional estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
