	<message>The QUALITY_ASSURE field for indicator 3-5-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;At UNODC, quality assurance measures are in place to collect, process and disseminate statistical data. They build on the &amp;#x2018;Principles governing international statistical activities&amp;#x2019; and regulate the collection, processing, publication and dissemination of data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All data for SDG indicators as compiled by the Office are sent to countries (through the relevant national focal points) for their review before statistical data are officially released by UNODC. When countries provide feedback/comments on the data, a technical discussion is conducted to identify a common position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At WHO quality assurance measures are in place for producing the health statistics that include the main indicators on alcohol consumption and its health consequences. WHO Technical Advisory Group on Alcohol and Drug Epidemiology provides technical advice and input to WHO activities on monitoring alcohol consumption and treatment capacity for substance use disorders in its Member States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data compilation is to be performed centrally by WHO and UNODC based on data collected from countries that later will be validated through official focal points. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
