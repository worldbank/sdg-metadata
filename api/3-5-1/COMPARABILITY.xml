&lt;p&gt;Given the heterogeneity of national data collection systems, there is potential for discrepancies related either to the differences in recording the number of people in treatment and for people with substance use disorders. For this purpose, the ARQ has recently been improved to allow for countries to specify the nature of the data reported and to enable UNODC to assess the accuracy and comparability of data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from evaluating the consistency of data and addressing data discrepancies by using additional sources, UNODC is in continuous communication and discusses technical issues with reporting countries in order to minimize discrepancies and inconsistency of data. &lt;/p&gt;
