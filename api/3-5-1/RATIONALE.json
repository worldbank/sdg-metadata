{"status":"success","message":"The RATIONALE field for indicator 3-5-1, translated into all languages","data":{"ar":"","en":"<p>According to UNODC and WHO data, around 271 million people aged 15 to 64 years worldwide used an illicit drug at least once in 2017, about 2.3 billion people are current drinkers of alcohol, some 35 million of people suffer from drug use disorders and 289 million from alcohol use disorders. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Substance use disorders are serious health conditions that present a significant burden for affected individuals, their families and communities. Untreated substance use disorders trigger substantial costs to society including lost productivity, increased health care expenditure, and costs related to criminal justice, social welfare, and other social consequences. Strengthening treatment services entails providing access to a comprehensive set of evidence-based interventions (-laid down in the international standards and guidelines) that should be available to all population groups in need. The indicator will inform the extent to which a range of evidence-based interventions for treatment of substance use disorder are available and are accessed by the population in need at country, regional and global level. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Even though effective treatment exists, only a small amount of people with substance use disorders receive it. For instance, it is estimated that globally one out of 7 people with drug use disorders have access to or provided drug treatment services (World Drug Report 2019). <a href=\"https://www.who.int/gho/substance_abuse/en/\" target=\"_blank\">WHO ATLAS-Substance Use</a> data showed that in 2014 only 11.9 % (out of 103 responding) countries reported high coverage (40% or more) for alcohol dependence. SDG indicator 3.5.1 is crucial for measurement the progress towards strengthening the treatment of substance abuse worldwide as formulated in the Target 3.5. </p>\n<p> </p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
