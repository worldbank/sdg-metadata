&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Household surveys &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Surveys among people using substances &amp;#x2013; using for instance respondent driven sampling &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Indirect methods such as capture/recapture or multiplier benchmark method &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surveys should be nationally representative, with a sample size sufficiently large to capture relevant events and compute needed disaggregation, and they should be based on a solid sample design. The use of indirect questions for network scale-up methods in household surveys is encouraged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment registries are the main source of data for the number of people receiving treatment. They should cover the entire national territory and be linked to all relevant agencies providing treatment services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To estimate the number of people with alcohol use disorders, preferred data sources are population-based surveys targeting the adult population (15+ years). International surveys such as WHS, STEPS, GENACIS, and ECAS represent good practices. &lt;/p&gt;
