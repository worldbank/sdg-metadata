In this questionnaire, through which ITU already collects a number of ICT indicators, ITU collects absolute values. The percentages are calculated a-posteriori. The survey methodology is verified to ensure that it meets adequate statistical standards. The data are verified to ensure consistency with previous years&amp;#x2019; data and other relevant country-level indicators (ICT and economic). &lt;/p&gt;
