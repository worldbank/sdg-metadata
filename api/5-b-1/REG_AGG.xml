			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Country-level data on the percentage of individuals owning mobile phones (owners of mobile phones as a percentage of total population) are first estimated using various techniques, such as hot-deck imputation, regression models and time series forecast. Hot-deck imputation uses data from countries with &amp;#x201C;similar&amp;#x201D; characteristics, such as GNI per capita and geographic location. In cases when it is not possible to find an adequate imputation based on similar cases, regression models are applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the country-level percentages are available for all countries, the number of mobile phone owners are calculated by multiplying the percentages to the population of the country. The regional and world total mobile phone owners were calculated by summing the country-level data. The aggregate percentages were calculated by dividing the regional totals by the population of respective groups.&lt;/p&gt;
