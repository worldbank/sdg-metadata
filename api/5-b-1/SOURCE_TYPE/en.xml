	<message>The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 5-b-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;This indicator is a newly developed International Telecommunication Union (ITU) indicator that was approved by the World Telecommunication/ICT Indicators Symposium (WTIS) in 2014. The indicator&amp;#x2019;s definition and methodology were developed under the coordination of ITU, through its Expert Groups, and following an extensive consultation process with countries. Data for the proportion of individuals owning a mobile phone were first collected in 2015 through an annual questionnaire that ITU sends to National Statistical Offices (NSO). In this questionnaire, through which ITU already collects several ICT indicators, ITU collects absolute values. The percentages are calculated a-posteriori. The survey methodology is verified to ensure that it meets adequate statistical standards. The data are verified to ensure consistency with previous years&amp;#x2019; data and other relevant country-level indicators (ICT and economic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data are usually not adjusted, but discrepancies in the definition, age scope of individuals, reference period, or the break in comparability between years are noted in a data note. For this reason, data are not always strictly comparable.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
