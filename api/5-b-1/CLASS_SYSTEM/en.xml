	<data>&lt;p&gt;For countries that collect this data through an official survey, and if data allow breakdown and disaggregation, the indicator can be broken down by region (urban/rural), sex, age group, educational level (International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) ), by labour force status (International Labour Organization (ILO)), and by occupation (International Standard Classification of Occupation (ISCO)). The International Telecommunication Union (ITU)) collects data for all these breakdowns from countries.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
