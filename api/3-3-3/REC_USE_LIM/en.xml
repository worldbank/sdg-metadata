	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 3-3-3, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The estimated incidence can differ from the incidence reported by a Ministry of Health which can be affected by: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the completeness of reporting: the number of reported cases can be lower than the estimated cases if the percentage of health facilities reporting in a month is less than 100% &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the extent of malaria diagnostic testing (the number of slides examined or RDTs performed) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the use of private health facilities which are usually not included in reporting systems. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the indicator is estimated only where malaria transmission occurs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</data>
