	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 4-1-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary completion rate is currently available for 150 Member States, representing 77% of all Member States. The lower secondary completion rate is available for 155 Member States, representing 80% of all Member States. Coverage for the upper secondary completion rate is similar, with data for 155 Member States, representing 80% of all Member States. The countries with completion rates are home to more than 90% of the global population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The completion rate is available for the years since 2000. National time series of raw data are incomplete due to the infrequent implementation of household surveys and censuses but &lt;a id=&quot;OLE_LINK512&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;OLE_LINK513&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;time series without gaps are available through the aforementioned reconstructed model-based estimates of the completion rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is disaggregated by sex, location, wealth and other dimensions specified in global indicator 4.5.1 (parity index). Model-based estimates are disaggregated by sex.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
