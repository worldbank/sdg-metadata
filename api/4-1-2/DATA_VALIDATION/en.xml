	<message>The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 4-1-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The UNESCO Institute for Statistics shares all indicator values and notes on methodology with National Statistical Offices (NSO), Ministries of Education, or other relevant agencies in individual countries for their review, feedback and validation before the publication of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a different validation and capacity building exercise, the completion rate model estimates will be consulted with countries. This annual consultation process will give each country&amp;#x2019;s education ministry and NSO the opportunity to review and provide feedback on all data inputs, the estimation methodology and the draft estimates.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
