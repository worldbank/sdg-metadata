	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National data are often collected and reported in reference to national systems of education. The mapping from a national classification to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) is not always straightforward and can cause discrepancies between national and international indicator estimates. Additional discrepancies can arise between single point in time estimates from a single source and model estimates, which use efficiently multiple sources. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
