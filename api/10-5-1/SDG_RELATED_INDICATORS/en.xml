	<data>&lt;p&gt;Linkages with any other Goals and Targets: Recommendation II.2 of G-20 Data Gap Initiative &amp;#x2013; 2 concerned FSIs. The G-20 economies were asked to report the seven FSIs required from Special Data Dissemination Standards Plus (SDDS Plus) adherent economies on a quarterly frequency, with a timeliness of one quarter. These are the same FSIs as covered by this SDG Indicator 10.5.1 except that the SDG indicator includes the FSI net open position in foreign exchange to capital instead of the residential real estate prices. The G-20 economies were also asked to voluntarily initiate regular collection of Concentration and Distribution Measures, depending on the results of their cost-benefit analysis and national priorities. The implementation of the two FSI-related recommendations was concluded at end-2021.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
