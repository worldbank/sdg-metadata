	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 10-5-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data for most countries are reported on a monthly or quarterly basis; a few countries report some FSI data on a semi-annual or annual basis and with a lag of more than a quarter. As of end-December 2021, there were more than 140 FSI reporters. Some countries&amp;#x2019; compilation practices deviate from the &lt;em&gt;2019 FSIs Guide&lt;/em&gt; methodology in certain areas and are documented in the FSIs metadata also posted on the IMF&amp;#x2019;s FSIs website. Reporting countries provide all or most core FSIs and some encouraged FSIs that can be used to support the interpretation of these seven SDG indicators. FSIs data and metadata reported by countries are available at http://data.imf.org/FSI.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
