	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data calculated by other sources could be different from the FSIs disseminated by the IMF due to the use of different compilation methodology and/or institutional coverage. The FSIs disseminated by the IMF are compiled based on the &lt;em&gt;2019&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;FSIs Guide&lt;/em&gt;, which provides the guidance on the concepts and definitions, and sources and techniques for the compilation of cross-country comparable data to support national and international surveillance of financial systems. To facilitate identification of possible discrepancies across countries, reporters provide metadata to the IMF that detail departures from recommendations in the &lt;em&gt;2019&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;FSIs Guide&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
