  &lt;li&gt;The common source data are data reported by banks for supervisory purposes. National supervisors check and validate the data that are used by national FSI compilers. IMF staff check data in the sectoral financial statements and memorandum series reported by countries and address data issues in collaboration with the national compilers whenever such issues are flagged by the validation and consistency checks implemented in the IMF data processing system before processing the data and posting the indicators on the FSIs website. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</data>
