{"status":"success","message":"The QUALITY_ASSURE field for indicator 6-3-1, translated into en","data":"<p>Data submitted to UNSD or OECD/Eurostat come directly from national statistical offices and/or ministries of environment. Data treatment and validation is done jointly by Eurostat and the OECD for their member states according to an agreed process and timeline. For those data submitted to UNSD a review is undertaken by the Environment Statistics Section for consistency. UNSD carries out extensive data validation procedures that include built-in automated procedures, manual checks and cross-references to national sources of data. Communication is carried out with countries for clarification and validation of data. UNSD does not make any estimation or imputation for missing values so the number of data points provided are actual country data. Only data that are considered accurate or those confirmed by countries during the validation process are included in UNSD&#x2019;s environment statistics database and disseminated on UNSD&#x2019;s website.</p>\n<p>UN-Habitat and WHO use the resulting data without modification. In case of any observed discrepancies or anomalies the national authorities are consulted for clarification.</p>\n<p>Estimates of domestic wastewater treatment are calculated based on national data and will be shared with countries for a consultation process similar to, and coordinated with, the consultation process used by WHO and UNICEF for indicators 6.1.1 and 6.2.1. </p>"}
