	<data>&lt;p&gt;The amount of wastewater generated is calculated by summing all of the wastewater generated by different economic activities and households. Wastewater flows are expressed in units of 1000 m3/day, although some data sources may use other units that require conversion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of wastewater safely treated is calculated by summing all of the wastewater flows which receive treatment considered equivalent to secondary treatment or better. This wastewater flow is expressed in units of 1000 m3/day, although some data sources may use other units that require conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proportion of wastewater flows which are safely treated is calculated as a ratio of the amount of wastewater safely treated to the amount of wastewater generated.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
