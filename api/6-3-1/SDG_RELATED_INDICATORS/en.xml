	<message>The SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS field for indicator 6-3-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The domestic portion of wastewater treated is closely linked to indicator 6.2.1a on the &amp;#x201C;proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services&amp;#x201D;, and draws upon some of the same data sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is also directly linked to indicator 6.3.2 on the &amp;#x201C;proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality&amp;#x201D;, because unsafe wastewater treatment leads to degradation in quality of the receiving waters. It directly informs progress towards target 6.3 and is strongly linked to target 6.6 on water-related ecosystems, as well as target 14.1 on marine pollution (coastal eutrophication).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
