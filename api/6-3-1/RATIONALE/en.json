SDG Target 6.3 sets out to improve ambient water quality, which is essential to protecting both ecosystem and human health, by eliminating, minimizing and significantly reducing different streams of pollution into water bodies.</p>\n<p>The purpose of monitoring progress using SDG indicator 6.3.1 is to provide necessary and timely information to decision makers and stakeholders to make informed decisions to accelerate progress towards reducing water pollution, minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and increasing wastewater treatment and reuse. The target wording covers wastewater recycling and safe reuse with implication on water use efficiency, although it is not fully addressed by the global indicator and methodology.</p>\n<p>SDG indicator 6.3.1 tracks the proportion of wastewater flows from households, services and industrial economic activities that are safely treated at the source or through centralized wastewater treatment plants before being discharged into the environment, out of the total volume of wastewater generated.</p>"}
