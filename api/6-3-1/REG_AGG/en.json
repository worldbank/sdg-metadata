{"status":"success","message":"The REG_AGG field for indicator 6-3-1, translated into en","data":"<p>Regional and global aggregates are produced by combining volumes of wastewater generated and treated from countries with data. For the purpose of calculating regional aggregate statistics, values for countries without national estimates are imputed on the basis of regional averages (e.g. using M49 sub-regions). These imputed data are never published separately as national statistics. </p>\n<p>Regional and global aggregate statistics are only produced when the data available without imputation represent at least 50% of the regional or global total. Ideally this coverage threshold would be based on wastewater volumes, but data on the volumes of wastewater generated are not available for all countries. Accordingly, as an interim measure, data coverage thresholds and weighting of national statistics will be done on the basis of national population, drawing on the latest statistics available from the UN World Population Prospects.</p>"}
