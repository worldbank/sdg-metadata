&lt;p&gt;Threshold (e.g. including/excluding small/large scale disasters): International Data Sources record only events that surpass some threshold of impact. For example, EMDAT records only events with mortality greater than 10, affected greater than 100 or an international declaration. Private Insurance or Reinsurance global disaster databases record only events that have insured losses, which affects negatively countries with low insurance market penetration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methodology / definition: International data sources use secondary data sources to assemble their datasets. These data sources usually have non uniform or even inconsistent methodologies, producing heterogeneous datasets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observation (national level data is more comprehensive): International data collectors, due to limitations on access to information, do not record a large number of events that are not publicised internationally, or are never &amp;apos;seen&amp;apos; by the secondary data sources used.&lt;/p&gt;
