&lt;p&gt;The Open-ended Intergovernmental Expert Working Group on Indicators and Terminology relating to Disaster Risk Reduction (OEIWG) was given the responsibility by the UNGA for the development of a set of indicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework, against the seven global targets. The work of the OEIWG shall be completed by December 2016 and its report submitted to the General Assembly for consideration. The IAEG-SDGs and the UN Statistical Commission formally recognizes the role of the OEIWG, and has deferred the responsibility for the further refinement and development of the methodology for disaster-related SDGs indicators to this working group.&lt;/p&gt;
