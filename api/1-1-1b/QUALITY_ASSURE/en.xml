	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data consistency and quality checks are regularly conducted for validation of the data before dissemination in the ILOSTAT database. These checks consist of data and metadata revision of all the relevant inputs applying protocols to ensure that international comparability and time-series consistency are maintained. For the resulting modelled estimates, both statistical and judgmental assessments of the output data are carried out.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
