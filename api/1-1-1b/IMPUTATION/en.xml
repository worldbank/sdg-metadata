	<data>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; Estimates are produced for countries and years for which no direct working poverty estimates are available based on household survey estimates, but for which total poverty estimates are available in the World Bank&amp;#x2019;s PovcalNet database. This is carried out through a multivariate regression model described in &amp;#x201C;Employment and economic class in the developing world&amp;#x201D; (Kapsos and Bourmpoula, 2013), available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---inst/documents/publication/wcms_216451.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---inst/documents/publication/wcms_216451.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; Following the step described directly above, missing data at the national level are estimated through a multivariate regression model for the purpose of producing global and regional estimates.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
