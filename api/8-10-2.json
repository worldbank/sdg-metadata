The data also include an additional 3 percent of respondents in 2021 who reported receiving wages, government transfers, a public sector pension, or payments for agricultural products into a financial institution account in the past year; paying utility bills or school fees from a financial institution account in the past year; or receiving wages, government transfers, or agricultural payments into a card in the past year. The definition does not include non-bank financial institutions such as pension funds, retirement accounts, insurance companies, or equity holdings such as stocks. </p>\n<p>Mobile money accounts denote the percentage of respondents who report personally using a mobile money service to make payments, buy things, or to send or receive money in the past year. Data on adults with a mobile money account include respondents who reported personally using services included in the GSM Association&#x2019;s Mobile Money for the Unbanked (GSMA MMU) database to pay bills or to send or receive money in the past year. The data also include an additional 2 percent of respondents in 2021 who reported receiving wages, government transfers, a public sector pension, or payments for agricultural products through a mobile phone in the past year. Unlike the definition of account at a financial institution, the definition of mobile money account does not include the payment of utility bills or school fees through a mobile phone. The reason is that the phrasing of the possible answers leaves it open as to whether those payments were made using a mobile money account or an over-the-counter service.</p><p>Percent (%)</p><p>Data is also aggregated using the World Bank classifications for World, low- and middle-income economies, income groups (low-income, lower-middle-income, and upper-middle-income economies), and developing regions.</p><p>The indicators in the <s>2021 </s>Global<u> Findex Database 2021</u><s> Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) database</s> are drawn from survey data covering almost 128,000 people in 123 economies&#x2014;representing 91 percent of the world&#x2019;s population. The survey was carried out over the 2021 calendar year<u>, and now marks the fourth round of Global Findex data since 2011. Typically, the survey captures data from more than 140 economies, but surveying was postponed in a handful of countries in 2021 due to COVID-19.

Surveys are conducted face-to-face in economies where telephone coverage represents less than 80 percent of the population or where in-person surveying is the customary methodology. However, during 2021, due to ongoing COVID-19&#x2013;related mobility restrictions, face-to-face interviewing was not possible in some of these economies.</p>\n<p>Phone-based surveys were therefore conducted in 67 economies that had been surveyed face-to-face in 2017. These 67 economies were selected for inclusion based on population size, phone penetration rate, COVID-19 infection rates, and the feasibility of executing phone-based methods where Gallup would otherwise conduct face-to-face data collection, while complying with all government-issued guidance throughout the interviewing process. Gallup takes both mobile phone and landline ownership into consideration. According to Gallup World Poll 2019 data, when face-to-face surveys were last carried out in these economies, at least 80 percent of adults in almost all of them reported mobile phone ownership. </p>\n<p>All samples are probability-based and nationally representative of the resident adult population. </p><p>Four rounds of data collection are completed, for years: 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2022. </p>\n<p>Surveying for 2020 was delayed to 2021 due to COVID-19 restrictions.</p><p>Data are collected every three years.</p><p>Collected by Gallup, Inc. through the Gallup World Poll and compiled by the World Bank</p><p>World Bank </p><p>Development Research Group (DECRG) is the World Bank&apos;s principal research department under the Development Economics Vice Presidency.

DECRG&apos;s research programs generate and disseminate knowledge about development policies essential for the achievement of the World Bank&apos;s ultimate mandate of poverty reduction and shared prosperity. Within DECRG, the &#x201C;Findex team&#x201D; manages the extensive Global Findex Database that provides in-depth data on how people, especially women and the poor, save, borrow, make payments and manage risk.</p>\n<p>The Global Findex Database is collected in partnership with Gallup, Inc., as a part of its Gallup World Poll.

Studies show that when people participate in the financial system, they are better able to start and expand businesses, invest in education, manage risk and absorb financial shocks. Measurement is key to understanding financial inclusion and identifying opportunities to remove barriers that may be preventing people from using financial services. The Global Findex Database 2021 is the first global, comparable database of demand-side financial inclusion indicators, capturing insights into how adults around the world save, borrow, make payments and manage risk.</p><p> Global Findex Database&#x2014;only measures the &#x2018;perception&#x2019; people have about their account ownership and usage by providing individual-level survey data on the demographic characteristics of users of financial services. This demand-side data collects information on the percent of adults who think of themselves as &#x2018;banked&#x2019; and having access to an account. The database complements but does replace existing supply-side data and other household surveys.</p><p>The indicator is based on data collected through individual level surveys in each country with representative samples. Data weighting is used to ensure a nationally representative sample for each economy. Final weights consist of the base sampling weight, which corrects for unequal probability of selection based on household size, and the poststratification weight, which corrects for sampling and nonresponse error. Poststratification weights use economy-level population statistics on gender and age and, where reliable data are available, education or socioeconomic status. Regional population weights are used to calculate regional aggregates. </p>\n<p>Full report, including methodology and interview procedures, data preparation, margin of error and notes by country are all available under Methodology Table A.1 here: <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/globalfindex/Report\"></a><a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/globalfindex/Report\">https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/globalfindex/Report</a></p><p>There is a thorough review process of the Global Findex surveys to ensure its quality and integrity. Gallup, Inc, the survey vendor for the Global Findex database, follows the highest standards for sampling and collecting the data and thoroughly vets the data before sharing it with the Global Findex team. Once the data is received by the Findex team, the team vets the data by comparing headline indicators from the database against data from previous rounds of the database.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/178667/gallup-world-poll-work.aspxNot\">Not</a> applicable</p><ul>\n  <li><strong>At country level </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p> Data for &#x201C;don&#x2019;t know&#x201D; and &#x201C;refused to answer&#x201D; form 0-1% of the total responses and are counted as &#x201C;no&#x201D; instead of missing.

The Findex team compares the data against (the limited number of) demand-side survey data from external sources for countries whenever available such as from the Financial Inclusion Insights Survey, FinScope, or from Central Banks. The team also consults with key practitioners both within the World Bank and at other key organizations to confirm the credibility of headline numbers on account ownership. </p><p>All the source code for the headline indicator is reviewed by an independent and external statistics department within the World Bank. </p><p><strong>Data availability: </strong></p>\n<p>There are 162 countries with regional and World aggregates that have at least 1 data point after 2011 for this indicator. </p>\n<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>\n<p>Triennial (2011,2014, 2017 and 2021)</p>\n<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>\n<p>Disaggregation are available by: Income (Adults in the poorest 40 percent of households vs. Adults in the richest 60 percent of households); Participation in labour force (In labor force vs. Out of labor force); Age (Ages 15-25 vs. Age 25+); Education level (Primary and below vs. Primary and above); Urbanicity of residence (Rural vs. Urban ); Gender (Female vs. Male)</p><p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>\n<p>Global Findex Database is an individual level survey, measuring an individual&#x2019;s perception of ownership of accounts. It assumes financial inclusion is an individual-level concept which may create two potential discrepancies. First, the data may deviate from supply side data which counts the number of accounts and may overstate the level of financial inclusion in a country if a significant number of adults have an account they do not use and did not formally close. Second, not all demand-side data is the same and that the data from different demand-side surveys cannot necessarily be compared if the survey method is different. In particular, surveys of individuals cannot be compared directly with surveys of household heads, since the use of financial services can differ considerably between different household members.</p><p><strong>URL:</strong> </p>\n<p>https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/globalfindex </p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong> </p>\n<p>Demirg&#xFC;&#xE7;-Kunt, Asli, Leora Klapper, Dorothe Singer, and Saniya Ansar. 2022.

Наличие доступа к счету является важной отправной точкой для доступа людей к целому ряду финансовых услуг.</p><h2><strong><strong> Комментарии и ограничения: </strong></strong></h2>\n<p>Глобальная база данных по охвату населения финансовыми услугами (ФИНДЕКС) основана на информации, получаемой из индивидуальных опросов, проводимых во всех странах мира каждые три года. Первый раунд опросов был проведен в 2011 году, а второй в 2014 году. Третий раунд будет проведен в 2017 году. База данных охватывает около 140 стран.</p><h1> Методология </h1>\n<h2> <strong> <strong> Метод расчета: </strong> </strong> </h2>\n<p> Показатель основан на данных, собираемых в ходе индивидуальных опросов в каждой стране с репрезентативными выборками.

Затем для региональных значений вычисляется сумма по всем странам региона и делится на общую численность взрослого населения, проживающего в этом регионе. Аналогичным образом для глобальных значений один и тот же расчет повторяется для всех стран.</p><h1> Наличие данных </h1>\n<h2><strong><strong> Описание:</strong></strong></h2>\n<p> Страны, имеющие по крайней мере 1 элемент данных после 2010 года по этому показателю: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Азиатско-Тихоокеанский регион: 35 </li>\n  <li> Африка: 38 </li>\n  <li> Латинская Америка и Карибский бассейн: 21 </li>\n  <li> Европа, Северная Америка, Австралия, Новая Зеландия и Япония: 47</li>\n</ul>\n<h2> <strong> <strong> Временные ряды: </strong> </strong> </h2>\n<p> Данные за 2011 и 2014 годы.

Поскольку доступ к финансовым услугам является понятием индивидуального уровня, эта процедура является подходящим инструментом оценки. Иные обследования, проводимые на уровне домохозяйств, могут включать оценку доступа к финансовым услугам при посредничестве другого члена домохозяйства, что может завысить уровень охвата финансовыми услугами.</p><h1> Ссылки </h1>\n<h2> <strong> <strong> URL: </strong> </strong> </h2>\n<p><a href=\"www.worldbank.org\">www.worldbank.org</a></p>\n<h2> <strong> <strong> Ссылки: </strong> </strong> </h2>\n<p> <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/globalfindex\"> http://www.worldbank.org/globalfindex </a> </p>"}}
