  &lt;li&gt;The Custodian Agencies will mine existing global report aggregators, to analyse the reports included in their databases in order to: &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide country specific information.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aggregate data at sub-regional, regional and global levels (avoiding double-counting of the same companies).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disaggregate data (company size, per industry).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The platform monitored will enable to aggregate e data to obtain a global figure as well as data per UN sub-region and region for inclusion in the Global SDGs Database, and as a basis for the analysis of progress carried out annually for the United Nations &lt;em&gt;Sustainable Development Goals Report&lt;/em&gt; and the Secretary General&amp;#x2019;s Report on Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While common definitions of company size, industries (defined below), etc. are required to be used by the custodian agencies for analysis and aggregation at regional and global levels and reporting to the SDGs Report, national governments may choose to use different definitions for their own analysis and reporting, such as for their Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs). Filters will be included on the online platform for the database which will allow governments and other users to filter information according to their own national definitions.&lt;/li&gt;
