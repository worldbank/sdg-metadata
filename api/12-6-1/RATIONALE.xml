			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;While the private sector has a critical role to play in the attainment of the SDGs, Target 12.6 and Indicator 12.6.1 are the only ones specifically monitoring the practices of private sector entities. While Indicator 12.6.1 counts the number of companies producing &amp;#x201C;sustainability reports&amp;#x201D;, the custodian agencies consider the indicator an important opportunity not only to monitor and promote the growth in sustainability reporting globally, but also to monitor and promote high quality reporting, promote the integration of sustainability information into the annual reporting cycle of companies, and promote sustainability practices by companies (as mentioned in the Target under which the indicator falls). Attempts have therefore been made to integrate all of these aspects into the methodology, to the extent possible to encourage companies to advance the quality of sustainability reporting by disclosing baseline indicators across economic, environmental, social and institutional dimensions (for more details, please consult Minimum and Advanced recommendations below)&lt;/p&gt;
