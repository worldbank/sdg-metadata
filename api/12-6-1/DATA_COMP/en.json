Adoption of the Goals required multi-stakeholder consultations, and all parties agreed that certain aspects of economic, environmental and social activities were material to them. It is also consistent with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report on climate-related financial risk disclosure, which indicates climate-related risk as a non-diversifiable risk that affects nearly all industries. The notion that some baseline aspects of sustainability information have an intrinsic impact on material risks is also echoed by the European Commission action plan on financing sustainable growth.</em> <a href=\"#footnote-ref-2\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>"}
