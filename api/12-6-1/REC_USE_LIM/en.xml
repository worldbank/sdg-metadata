	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 12-6-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The indicator is limited by the number of reports published on ESG rating platforms and collected by global report aggregators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analytics are carried out in all official UN languages and a variety of other languages, but not all national languages are covered. Therefore, there could be some reports that cannot be captured for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
