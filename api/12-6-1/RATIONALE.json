{"status":"success","message":"The RATIONALE field for indicator 12-6-1, translated into all languages","data":{"ar":"","en":"<p>While the private sector has a critical role to play in the attainment of the SDGs, Target 12.6 and Indicator 12.6.1 are the only ones specifically monitoring the practices of private sector entities. While Indicator 12.6.1 counts the number of companies producing &#x201C;sustainability reports&#x201D;, the custodian agencies consider the indicator an important opportunity not only to monitor and promote the growth in sustainability reporting globally, but also to monitor and promote high quality reporting, promote the integration of sustainability information into the annual reporting cycle of companies, and promote sustainability practices by companies (as mentioned in the Target under which the indicator falls). Attempts have therefore been made to integrate all of these aspects into the methodology, to the extent possible.</p>\n<p>Given the above, the custodian agencies propose an approach whereby:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Rather than simply counting the number of companies publishing stand-alone sustainability reports, the indicator methodology will focus on the sustainability information published by a company, whether in the form of a stand-alone sustainability report, or integrated within other company reports, such as the annual report. Therefore, in this respect, for the purposes of this indicator, &#x2018;sustainability report&#x2019; can refer to a stand-alone sustainability report, or sustainability information reported under other formats, such as integrated into the company&#x2019;s annual report.</li>\n  <li>Not every document entitled &#x2018;sustainability report&#x2019; will be counted towards the indicator, given that the quality of these reports varies greatly, and that many may not contain meaningful information on all aspects of sustainability (governance, economic, social and environmental).</li>\n  <li>A minimum requirement is therefore proposed, whereby for a company to be counted towards the indicator, it must have published information on a set of key disclosure elements covering the company&#x2019;s governance practices as well as economic, social and environment impacts. This will ensure that companies who produce sustainability reports that are weak in terms of their disclosure will not be counted and should promote more rigorous reporting.</li>\n</ul>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
