In recent years the convention within UNICEF and partner organizations has shifted to referring to &#x2018;female genital mutilation&#x2019;, or FGM, a term which is now used interchangeably with FGM/C throughout the metadata. Other common terms for the practice include &#x2018;female circumcision&#x2019; and &#x2018;excision&#x2019;. The custodian will request the IAEG-SDGs to consider a refinement of the indicator name to reflect this change for consideration at the UN Statistical Commission in 2022. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-2\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>"}
