	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 8-3-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data for this indicator is available for 89 countries and territories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both country-reported estimates and ILO harmonized estimates of informal employment are available in ILOSTAT (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ilostat.ilo.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://ilostat.ilo.org/&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This submission does not include data for regional aggregates of Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) because of low data availability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The submission covers data from 2000 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on this indicator is requested disaggregated by sector and sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, sector refers to the breakdown by agriculture/non-agriculture. Where necessary and possible, the disaggregation by sector could go into a more detailed breakdown by economic activity, but for the purpose of global and regional monitoring, the aggregate categories of agriculture and non-agriculture are used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to produce this indicator, employment statistics disaggregated by formal / informal employment and by economic activity (agriculture / non-agriculture) are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
