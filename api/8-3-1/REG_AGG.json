Global and regional estimates do not include the breakdown by sector (agriculture, non-agriculture). The estimates range from 2004 to 2022. Input data for informality is available for at least one year of the series in 75 per cent of the countries in the target sample. Benchmark employment data are derived from the ILO modelled estimates series. </p>\n<p>Missing observations are imputed using a series of models that establish statistical relationships between the observed incidence of informal employment and explanatory variables. The explanatory variables used include economic and demographic variables, such as GDP per capita and urbanisation. Panel data regression and cross-validation techniques are used to establish the statistical relationships necessary for the imputation. The global and regional proportions of informal employment are obtained by first adding up, across countries, the numerator and denominator of the formula that defines the proportion of workers in informal employment outlined above. </p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
