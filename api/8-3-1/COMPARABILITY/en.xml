	<data>&lt;p&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although some international standards do exist for the compilation of informal employment statistics, the relevant concepts and definitions have been left relatively flexible so as to accommodate national contexts and needs. This means that, in practice, the operational criteria used by countries to compile data at the national level vary significantly from country to country, hindering the international comparability of statistics. The comparability of informal employment statistics is also highly sensitive to differences in the geographical areas covered, the economic activities covered and the treatment of special groups of workers.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
