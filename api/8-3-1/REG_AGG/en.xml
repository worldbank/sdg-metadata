	<data>&lt;p&gt;The ILO produces single year global and regional estimates of informal employment by sex and economic sector (total, agriculture, non-agriculture) on the basis of available national estimates. The current estimates have a benchmark year of 2019 and input data range from 2009 to 2019 with 67 per cent of the countries referring to 2018 or 2019. Benchmark employment data are derived from the ILO modelled estimates series. The input data used in the production of the 2019 estimates cover 92.8 per cent of global employment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Values for missing countries are imputed on the basis of average (mean) values for each country income group (based on the World Bank&amp;#x2019;s classification of four country income groups) within each ILO broad sub-region, as shown here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/classification-country-groupings/&quot;&gt;https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/classification-country-groupings/&lt;/a&gt;. If imputations cannot be carried out at the level of ILO broad sub-region and four income groups, they are done at the level of ILO region and four income groups. For some upper-middle-income countries for which imputations are not feasible through the above methodologies, the imputations are carried out according to three income groups (merging all upper- and lower-middle-income countries into a single middle-income group) and ILO broad sub-region.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
