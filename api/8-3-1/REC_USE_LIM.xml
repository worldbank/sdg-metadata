			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The considerable heterogeneity of definitions and operational criteria used by countries to measure informal employment greatly hinders the international comparability of statistics on informality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to counter this challenge, for the purpose of SDG global reporting and monitoring, the series is solely based on harmonized data produced by the ILO using the same operational process for all countries. Although some differences in criteria and definitions remain across countries, the process is designed to produce data that are as internationally comparable as possible given the underlying data sources. &lt;/p&gt;
