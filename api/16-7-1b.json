Since there is no international definition of &#x2018;positions&#x2019; in the public service and therefore most countries have their own national classification for public service positions, a harmonized set of occupational categories in the public service is needed to ensure the comparability of data reported for this indicator. <ul>\n      <li>The International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-08) was used to identify four &#x2018;core&#x2019; occupational categories in the public service<sup><a href=\"#footnote-8\" id=\"footnote-ref-8\">[7]</a></sup> found to be relatively typical in every government, namely Managers (ISCO-08 Major Group 1), Professionals (ISCO-08 Major Group 2), Technicians and Associate Professionals (ISCO-08 Major Group 3) and Clerical Support Workers (ISCO-08 Major Group 4). </li>\n      <li>Moreover, the rationale of this indicator places a particular focus on &#x2018;front-line service workers&#x2019; which frequently interact directly with the public,<sup><a href=\"#footnote-9\" id=\"footnote-ref-9\">[8]</a></sup> such as police personnel, education personnel, health personnel and front-desk administrative personnel. While this list of front-line public service jobs is not exhaustive, these four categories were selected given the substantial portion of public service jobs they account for, and the frequent direct interaction these public servants have with the public. </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong><em>Appointed/elected positions:</em> </strong>In order to ensure consistent reporting, it is important to distinguish positions that are appointed (or elected) by the government or the head of government, and career public servant positions obtained on the basis of merit and seniority. This indicator only considers the latter &#x2013; i.e. positions held by career public servants, obtained on the basis of merit and seniority. NB: This consideration is most likely to affect positions in the &#x2018;managers&#x2019; occupational category. <sup><a href=\"#footnote-10\" id=\"footnote-ref-10\">[9]</a></sup> </li>\n  <li><strong><em>Disability status:</em> </strong>To disaggregate public servant data by disability status, it is recommended that countries use the <a href=\"https://www.washingtongroup-disability.com/fileadmin/uploads/wg/Documents/Questions/Washington_Group_Questionnaire__1_-_WG_Short_Set_on_Functioning.pdf\">Short Set of Questions on<strong> </strong>Disability<strong> </strong>elaborated by the Washington Group</a>.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-11\" id=\"footnote-ref-11\">[10]</a></sup> </li>\n</ul><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-4\">3</sup><p> It is important to note that data on general government employment is different from data on &#x2018;public sector employment&#x2019;, calculated under the International Labour Organisation (ILO) framework, which includes employment in public corporations (here to be excluded) <a href=\"#footnote-ref-4\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-5\">4</sup><p> The following types of government employees are included in the SNA definition of general government, but excluded for the purposes of this indicator: local government units (see also next footnote for further detail), social security funds, military. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-5\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-6\">5</sup><p> Employment data from local government units should <em>not</em> be collected for reporting on indicator 16.7.1.

In order for local government units to be treated as institutional units, the 2008 SNA specifies that they &#x201C;must be entitled to own assets, raise funds and incur liabilities by borrowing on their own account; similarly, they must have some discretion over how such funds are spent. They should also be able to appoint their own officers, independently of external administrative control.&#x201D; Since this is not the case in all countries, global reporting on this indicator excludes this administrative level. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-6\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-7\">6</sup><p> Such &#x2018;states&#x2019; may be described by different terms in different countries.

It is the basis for many national occupation classifications and the standard for labour information worldwide. A job is defined in ISCO-08 as &#x201C;a set of tasks and duties performed, or meant to be performed, by one person, including for an employer or in self-employment&#x201D;. Occupation refers to the kind of work performed in a job. More specifically, the concept of occupation is defined in ISCO-08 as a &#x201C;set of jobs whose main tasks and duties are characterized by a high degree of similarity&#x201D;. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-8\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-9\">8</sup><p> Diverse representation among front-line service workers is important as it has been found to help raise the quality of public services by improving the understanding of community needs and ameliorating social dialogue and communication with the wider population.

For instance, appointing more women (or more individuals from a certain disadvantaged population group) to leadership positions that change with elections is fundamentally different (and can be done much more quickly) from promoting women (or a disadvantaged population group) through the ranks to top positions in the public service.

Data for this indicator must therefore be collected at the country level.</p>\n<p>The types of national data sources that provide information on the public service include:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Surveys:</em> Very few countries carry out periodic employment surveys specifically focused on the public service. Generally, survey data on public service employment is a subset of more comprehensive employment datasets collected through other national surveys, such as labour force surveys, household surveys, surveys/censuses of economic establishments, etc. National population censuses are a better source in term of coverage and level of disaggregation, but they happen only every ten years. Given the level of disaggregation required for this indicator, it is unlikely that existing survey data will be sufficient to report on this indicator.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-12\" id=\"footnote-ref-12\">[11]</a></sup> </li>\n  <li><em>Administrative records:</em> Centralized registries on public servants tend to be more precise (i.e. no sampling error), more up-to-date and more amenable to disaggregation than public service employment statistics derived from surveys. In most countries, several national institutions produce administrative records on public service employment. These typically include: </li>\n  <li>A Public Service Commission (or related institution such as a Ministry of Public Administration or a Ministry of Finance) maintaining a centralized registry on the public service workforce <em>at the national/central level</em>; </li>\n  <li>Another institution maintaining a similar registry on the public service workforce <em>at the sub-national level</em> (such as a Ministry of Local Government or of Municipal Affairs); </li>\n  <li>A Police Services Commission or the like maintaining a centralized registry on police personnel; and</li>\n  <li>A National Statistical Office (NSO) producing general government employment statistics from labour force survey data, or from administrative data submitted by the above-mentioned national institutions maintaining public service registers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The most common and most comprehensive method for collecting public servant data is a Human Resource Management Information System (HRMIS), which is typically maintained by a Public Service Commission (or related institution such as a Ministry of Public Administration or a Ministry of Finance). Such systems have been found to produce the most robust data and to have the greatest potential for expansion on various dimensions of disaggregation. Since administrative data produced by a HRMIS is not considered &#x201C;official&#x201D; data in its raw form, it is recommended that the national institution maintaining a HRMIS collaborate with the NSO for the latter to provide the necessary quality assurance over the data produced by the public service body. </p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-12\">11</sup><p> Countries may also want to consult the ILO&#x2019;s &#x201C;Quick Guide on Sources and Uses of Labour Statistics&#x201D;, which reviews various sources that can be used to produce labour statistics, including labour force surveys and national account statistics.

UNDP Oslo Governance Centre was mandated to support countries to monitor progress on SDG16 and to produce governance statistics which includes the representation and participation in public service. </p><p>The public service is the bedrock of government &#x2013; where the development and implementation of public policies and programmes takes place and where society interacts with the government. In most countries, the public service is also the single largest employer. It is in this context that SDG 16, under its target 16.7, encourages countries to ensure that the public service is representative of the people it serves &#x201C;at all levels&#x201D;.</p>\n<p>Indicator 16.7.1 focuses on proportional representation in public institutions; it measures the extent to which a country&#x2019;s public institutions are representative of the general population. Proportional representation (also known as &#x2018;descriptive representation&#x2019;) in the public service is concerned with the extent to which the composition of the public service mirrors the various socio-demographic groups in the national population. The underlying assumption is that when the public service reflects the social diversity of a nation, this may lead to greater legitimacy of the public service in the eyes of citizens, as public servants resemble the people they provide services to. Proportional representation has been found to be associated with higher levels of trust in public institutions, as people perceive more inclusive policymaking processes to improve the quality and fairness of policy decisions, and to help curb the undue influence of vested interests over decision-making.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-13\" id=\"footnote-ref-13\">[12]</a></sup> </p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-13\">12</sup><p> See OECD (2017), <em>Trust and Public Policy: How Better Governance Can Help Rebuild Public Trust.</em> <a href=\"#footnote-ref-13\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div><ul>\n  <li><strong><em>Measuring representation: </em></strong>The significance of &#x2018;descriptive&#x2019; or &#x2018;proportional&#x2019; representation has been challenged in different ways:<ul>\n      <li>There is the question of why be attentive to some groups (women, young people, minorities, etc.) but not others (the poor, LGBTI, &quot;ethnic&quot; groups who might not be officially recognized, etc.). Moreover, in countries whose populations are a mosaic of many diverse groups (some of which may account for less than 1 percent of the population), an exact reflection of such pluralism in the composition of the public service would be impossible and unnecessary. Finally, descriptive representation has the danger of ultimately becoming an end in itself. Concerns about effective representation should not end once the public service has the appropriate number of public servants representing each minority groups. These public servants should be able to articulate minority concerns and should have the same opportunities as others to have some influence on policy formulation and implementation. Nevertheless, if a public service includes none, or very few, women, young people or minorities, that is probably a worrying sign that the interests of these particular groups are not being heard. </li>\n      <li>The age, sex, disability and population group status of individuals holding positions at various levels of decision-making in the public service provide an indication at the symbolic level of the way in which power is shared within an institution. However, there is no certainty that because a Manager is young (or old), a woman (or a man), or belongs to a minority group, s/he will bring to the fore issues of interest to groups with the same socio-demographic profile.</li>\n      <li>Tracking the age of public servants offers some measure of youth representation in the public service. However, in most ministries and agencies constituting the public service around the world, leadership positions such as those falling in the category of &#x2018;Managers&#x2019; are considered senior functions which require considerable experience, and are awarded on the basis of seniority. This means that such positions are by nature unlikely to be held by individuals in the younger age brackets. As such, for positions falling in the category of &#x2018;Managers&#x2019;, more relevant insights will be generated on the basis of sex disaggregation, or disaggregation based on disability or population group status. </li>\n      <li>Finally, governments use various ways to deliver public services, including through a range of partnerships with the private or not-for-profit sectors, and this indicator does not account for the staffing composition of other such entities which may have been contracted by the government to deliver public services. While in several countries, the large majority of health care providers, teachers and emergency workers are directly employed by the government, in others, public-private service delivery arrangements are in place, which means that many of these professionals are employed by organisations that are not state-owned, or by private contractors. Since this indicator does not account for the outsourcing of public service provision by the government, it may not give a complete picture of the representativeness of those who provide public services &#x2013; irrespective of who their employer is. </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong><em>Rationale for computing ratios rather than proportions: </em></strong>It may be noted that the below computation methods lead to ratios rather than simple proportions. The rationale for this is simple: while a simple proportion of &#x2018;young&#x2019; public servants is not internationally comparable. For instance, 32% of &#x2018;young&#x2019; public servants (<a href=\"https://au.int/sites/default/files/treaties/7789-treaty-0033_-_african_youth_charter_e.pdf\">34 years old or younger</a>) may be an over-representation of youth in country A where only 20% of the national population (above eligibility age for a public service job) falls in this age bracket (Ratio 3 = 38/20 = 1.6), but in country B where 40% of the national population is 34 years old or younger (and above eligibility age for a public service job), the same 32% would be interpreted as under-representation (Ratio = 32/40 = 0.8). In this example, the figure of 32% is not internationally comparable (it means over-representation in one country and under-representation in another), but the ratios 1.6 and 0.8 are internationally comparable. They help us understand whether 32% of public servants aged 34 years old or less is close to, or far from, proportional representation of this age group in the national population.<strong><em> </em></strong></li>\n  <li><strong><em>Sensitivity of collecting disability and population group data in the public service: </em></strong>In certain contexts, population group status may prove to be a sensitive and politically charged variable. For example, several countries actively restrict or ban identification of ethnic or religious status, in order to protect vulnerable populations or discourage inter-ethnic conflict. In addition, definitions of groups that constitute a minority vary greatly between countries. Furthermore, there is a strong human rights principle that individuals must be able to choose to identify themselves as members of a minority, or not. It would not be appropriate for public service bodies (or any other body) to assume or to assign public servants a certain membership of a particular population group. As such, administrative data collection systems in the public service should allow public servants to self-report on membership of nationally relevant population groups. Similarly, discriminatory perceptions and implicit bias against disability can make the collection of data by public service bodies on this characteristic equally sensitive. This is partly because public servants with disabilities, like everyone else, have a right to privacy and therefore are not under an obligation to reveal a disability. Moreover, in many states, information concerning disability falls under the umbrella of health data and is therefore confidential, thus preventing public service bodies to release this information even on an anonymous basis.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-14\" id=\"footnote-ref-14\">[13]</a></sup> </li>\n  <li><strong><em>Normative framework: </em></strong>The indicator calls for disaggregation of positions by age, sex, nationally relevant population groups and disability status. The following international human rights instruments contain provisions on enhancing opportunities for participation by individuals and groups holding such characteristics: <ul>\n      <li><em>The universal right and opportunity to participate in public affairs: </em>Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) recognizes &#x201C;the right and opportunity, without distinction of any kind such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives&#x201D;. General Comment 25 of the Human Rights Committee elaborates that access to public service employment should be based on equal opportunity and general principles of merit, and that the provision of secured tenure would ensure that persons holding public service positions are free from political interference or pressures.</li>\n      <li><em>Sex: </em>The 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) provides the basis for realizing equality between women and men through ensuring women&apos;s equal access to, and equal opportunities in, political and public life, including the right to participate in the formulation of government policy and the implementation thereof and to hold public office and perform all public functions at all levels of government (Article 7). States parties agree to take all appropriate measures to overcome historical discrimination against women and obstacles to women&#x2019;s participation in decision-making processes (Article 8), including legislation and temporary special measures (Article 4). The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action also call for women&#x2019;s equal access to public service jobs, by setting a target of a minimum of 30 percent of women in leadership positions.</li>\n      <li><em>Age: </em>The 2015 Security Council Resolution 2250 urges Member States to consider ways to increase inclusive representation of <em>youth</em> in decision-making at all levels in local, national, regional and international institutions and mechanisms to prevent and resolve conflict and counter violent extremism. </li>\n      <li><em>&#x2018;Population group&#x2019; status: </em>The Declaration on the Rights of Persons belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities (1992) and the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2007) provide that persons belonging to minorities and indigenous peoples have the right to participate in the political, economic, social and cultural life of the State. </li>\n      <li><em>Disability status: </em>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006) calls upon State Parties to ensure that persons with disabilities can effectively and fully participate in political and public life on an equal basis with others. Under Article 31 of the Convention, State Parties commit to collecting disaggregated information, including statistical and research data to give effect to the Convention, and assume responsibility for the dissemination of these statistics. </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong><em>Transposing national classifications of public service jobs into ISCO-08 based occupational categories for the public service: </em></strong>The ISCO-08 based occupational categories proposed above for this indicator are meant to be broad enough to accommodate considerable diversity among national classifications.

Countries should use the online data forms and accompanying guidance provided on this platform to report on this indicator.<em> </em></li>\n  <li><em>Countries are encouraged to report data that is available</em>, understanding that public servant disaggregated data for disability status and nationally-relevant population groups may not be currently available in many jurisdictions. Countries are encouraged to build additional capacities to disaggregate data by these demographic groups. </li>\n  <li><em>Information for part-time positions should be given in full-time equivalents</em> and should be counted only for permanent posts actually filled. It is important to consider the part-time or full-time status of posts to address the risk that some target groups may be underemployed and over-reported (e.g. If women are more likely to receive part-time posts than full-time posts, there might be a false impression that women are equally represented in those posts, when in reality they work less than their male counterparts due to their part-time status). </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Global reporting on indicator 16.7.1(b) can be done in three steps: </p>\n<p><strong>Step 1 </strong>requires data producers to compile the raw numbers of personnel in the public service, disaggregated along administrative level, occupational categories, and the various demographic characteristics.

levels</p>\n<p>The World Population Prospects database, published by the United Nations Population Division, provides official statistics collected from over 230 national statistical offices on

These lower and upper age boundaries will vary depending on the country, and need to be defined by each country in the below formula. For instance, if the minimum age to be eligible for a public service job in a given country is 18 years old, and the mandatory retirement age for public servants is 65 years old, then comparing public servants belonging to a particular population group (say, a particular ethnic group) with the corresponding share of this ethnic group in the national population, then it is important to focus only on those members of this ethnic group aged between 18 and 65. </p>\n<p>The resulting ratios can be interpreted as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>0, when there is no representation at all in the respective sub-category of the public service</li>\n  <li>&lt;1, when the representation in the respective sub-category is lower in the public service than in the working-age population </li>\n  <li>=1, when the representation in the respective sub-category is equal across the public service and the working-age population </li>\n  <li>&gt;1, when the representation in the respective sub-category is higher in the public service than in the working-age population</li>\n</ul>\n<p><u>Employment in public service at NATIONAL/CENTRAL level</u></p>\n<p><em>(Same ratios to be calculated for employment in public service at SUB-NATIONAL level, in separate table)</em></p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td></td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Female representation ratios: </strong></p>\n        <p>Proportion of female public servants in [occupational category x] / Proportion of women in the working-age population</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>&#x2018;Youth&#x2019;

(see cells highlighted in green in the table above), namely: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Ratios 1a) and b): Representation of female public servants &#x2018;overall&#x2019; (across all occupational categories) and representation of women in the &#x2018;Manager&#x2019; category </strong><em>(separate ratios for national and sub-national levels):</em> These two ratios are important because women remain significantly underrepresented in the public service across all regions, both in the public service as a whole and in the top levels of the public service (UNDP, Gender Equality in Public Administration &#x2013; GEPA, 2014). The target of a minimum of 30 percent of women in leadership positions, originally endorsed by ECOSOC in 1990 and reaffirmed in the Beijing Platform for Action in 1995, remains unmet in most countries. For instance, according to the Worldwide Index of Women as Public Sector Leaders developed (Ernst &amp; Young, 2013), across the G20 major economies, women represent less than 20 percent of public sector leadership. </li>\n  <li><strong>Ratio 2: Representation of &#x2018;young&#x2019; public servants<em> </em>aged 34 and below across all occupational categories </strong><em>(separate ratios for national and sub-national levels):</em><strong> </strong>This ratio is important because in several countries, there is a significant age gap between those in public service and the people they serve (UNDP GEPA, 2014), which has been found to undermine young people&#x2019;s trust in public institutions (OECD, 2017). To remedy this situation, the UN Security Council has urged Member States to &#x201C;consider ways to increase inclusive representation of youth in decision-making at all levels in local, national, regional and international institutions&#x201D; (UN SC Resolution 2250, 2015).</li>\n  <li><strong>Ratio 3: Representation of public servants with a disability across all occupational categories </strong><em>(separate ratios for national and sub-national levels): </em>This ratio is important because persons with disabilities remain significantly underrepresented in the public service, and under Article 31 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006), State Parties have committed to collecting disaggregated information to give effect to the Convention&#x2019;s call to ensure that persons with disabilities can effectively and fully participate in public life on an equal basis with others.</li>\n  <li><strong>Ratio 4: Representation of public servants belonging to Population Group A (B,C,D, etc.) across all occupational categories </strong><em>(separate ratios for national and sub-national levels): </em>This ratio important because evidence shows that when public servants resemble the people they provide services to, with respect to their ethnic, linguistic or religious affiliations, or to their indigenous status, citizens perceive the public service to be more legitimate. Proportional representation of nationally-relevant population groups in the public service has been found to be associated with higher levels of public trust in public institutions.</li>\n</ul><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-15\">14</sup><p> In the event that a mandatory retirement age (MRA) has not been set for the public service specifically in a given country, the &#x201C;default retirement age&#x201D; (DRA) could be used as an alternative.

For the purpose of this indicator, particular focus is placed on minorities. <em>Minority groups are </em>groups that are numerically inferior to the rest of the population of a state, in a non-dominant position, whose members&#x2014;being nationals of the state&#x2014;possess ethnic, religious or linguistic characteristics differing from those of the rest of the population and show, even if only implicitly, a sense of solidarity directed towards preserving their culture, traditions, religion or language. While the nationality criterion included in the above definition has often been challenged, the requirement to be in a non-dominant position remains important (United Nations, 2010). Collecting public servant data disaggregated by population groups should be subject to the legality of compiling such data in a particular national context and to a careful assessment of the potential risks of collecting such data for the safety of respondents). <a href=\"#footnote-ref-19\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div><p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>\n<p>There is no internationally estimated data for this indicator.</p><ul>\n  <li>Arnesen and Peters, &#x201C;The Legitimacy of Representation: How Descriptive, Formal, and Responsiveness Representation Affect the Acceptability of Political Decisions&#x201D;, Comparative Political Studies 2018, Vol. 51(7) 868&#x2013;899. </li>\n  <li>Bird, &#x201C;Comparing the political representation of ethnic minorities in advanced democracies.
