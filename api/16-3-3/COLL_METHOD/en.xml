	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 16-3-3, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data are collected by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) through a standardised questionnaire sent to countries. This questionnaire provides specific definitions of data to be collected and it collects a set of metadata to identify possible discrepancies from standard definitions and to assess overall data quality (e.g. sample size, target population, agency responsible for the data collection, etc.). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data for multiple years are collected to assess data consistency across time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Countries can use the collected data to calculate the indicators based on the proposed module or using other data sources (e.g. SDG 16 Survey Initiative, crime victimization surveys among others). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</data>
