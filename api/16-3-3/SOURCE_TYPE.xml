			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The Indicator is based on four questions to be included in a household survey. The four questions can be part of an add-on access to justice survey module, to be incorporated into other ongoing general population surveys (such as surveys on crime victimization, corruption, governance, quality of life, public attitudes or surveys on other topics) or be part of dedicated surveys on access to justice and legal needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data should be collected as part of a nationally representative probability sample of adult population residing in the country, irrespective of legal residence status. The sampling frame and sample design should ensure that results can be disaggregated at sub-national level. The sample size should be sufficiently large to capture relevant events and compute needed disaggregation.&lt;/p&gt;
