{"status":"success","message":"The SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS field for indicator 16-3-3, translated into all languages","data":{"ar":"","en":"<p>This indicator complements the other indicators of 16.3 which focus on rates of pretrial detention and reporting of victimization and thereby provides a more holistic picture of people&#x2019;s ability to access justice mechanisms across a wide range of disputes. </p>\n<p>This indicator also relates to several other targets under SDG 16 on issues that may require access to justice. For instance, people need to access justice institutions and mechanisms when they are subject to (or a witness of) corruption (target 16.5), when they have problems in accessing government payments (such as social safety net assistance) or public services (target 16.6), when they have difficulty in obtaining legal identify, such as birth registration (target 16.9), or when they experience discrimination (target 16.B). </p>\n<p>In addition, the indicator relates to other Goals that have targets conveying aspirations for more just and fair societies. For instance, people may need to access justice institutions and mechanisms when faced with discrimination in education (target 4.5), when subject to discrimination against women and girls (target 5.1), when seeking &#x2018;equal pay for work of equal value&#x2019; (target 8.5), when wanting their labor rights to be upheld (target 8.8), or when demanding that equal opportunity laws be respected (target 10.3).</p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
