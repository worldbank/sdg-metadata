&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Legal Needs Surveys and Access to Justice methodological guidance published by OECD in 2019 provides methodological guidance for developing the questionnaires and conducting such surveys. This guide brings together the experience gained through more than 60 national surveys conducted by governments and civil society organizations in more than 30 jurisdictions in the last 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
