			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The country specific commodity balances underlying the IEA CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions estimates are based on national energy data of heterogeneous nature converted and adapted to fit the IEA format and methodology. Considerable effort has been made to ensure that the data adhere to the IEA definitions based on the guidelines provided by IRES. Nevertheless, energy statistics at the national level are often collected using criteria and definitions which differ, sometimes considerably, from those of international organisations. This is especially true for non-OECD countries, which are submitting data to the IEA on a voluntary basis. The IEA has identified most of these differences and, where possible, adjusted the data to meet international definitions. For details on recognized country specific anomalies and the corresponding adjustments, please refer to country specific notes included in the IEA World energy balances documentation file available at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/WORLDBAL_Documentation.pdf&quot;&gt;wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/WORLDBAL_Documentation.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNIDO compiles the MVA data based on the UNSD National Accounts Main Aggregates Database (NAMAD) and national publications. UNSD collects national accounts data through a regular consultation with countries and areas by sending the UN NAQ to obtain important information about differences in concept, scope, coverage and classification used. The final estimates are provided to facilitate international comparability. More detailed information on estimation methods is available here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/assets/pdf/methodology.pdf&quot;&gt;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/assets/pdf/methodology.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MVA data are nowcasted by UNIDO to enhance a timely analysis of manufacturing trends.&lt;/p&gt;
