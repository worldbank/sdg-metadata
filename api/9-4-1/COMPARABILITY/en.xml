	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 9-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IEA CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from fuel combustion, used for calculating these indicators, is a global database obtained following harmonised definitions and comparable methodologies across countries. However, it does not represent an official source for national GHG inventories submissions by the countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Difference may arise due to different sources of official energy data, dissimilarities in the underlying methodologies, adjustments and estimations. More information on these sources of differences is available in the IEA database documentation file available at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/Worldco2_Documentation.pdf&quot;&gt;wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/Worldco2_Documentation.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, difference may arise if the country has not submitted energy consumption data adequately dis-aggregated by sector or by energy sources and/or due to conversion of value data into USD.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
