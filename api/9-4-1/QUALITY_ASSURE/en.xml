	<message>The QUALITY_ASSURE field for indicator 9-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The IEA has extensive data quality checks on the energy data submissions (around 30 statisticians working on it), and iterates with countries on data issues and how to address them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IEA also works in cooperation with the IPCC and the UNFCCC to ensure the highest consistency between international methodologies and those adopted at the IEA; the IEA validates energy data submitted to the UNFCCC by countries within their inventories. The IEA convenes international workshops among partner Agencies working on energy data to ensure that consistency between energy data at global level is enhanced continuously, and methodologies are harmonised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/unsystem/Documents/QAF-UNIDO.pdf&quot;&gt;The UNIDO Quality Assurance Framework&lt;/a&gt; is followed to ensure that the statistical activities of UNIDO are relevant and the data compiled and disseminated are accurate, complete within the defined scope and coverage, timely, comparable in terms of internationally recommended methods and classification standards and internally coherent to variables included in the datasets. While these generally accepted, broad dimensions of quality of statistical data may be defined in each NSO&amp;apos;s own quality assurance framework. UNIDO makes maximum effort that data produced from the statistical operation undertaken with the UNIDO technical cooperation are accurate, internationally comparable and coherent.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
