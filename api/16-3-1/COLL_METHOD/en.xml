	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 16-3-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;There is a consolidated system of annual data collection on crime and criminal justice (UN- Crime Trends Survey, UN-CTS) which represents the basis of data on intentional homicide, criminal justice outputs, penitentiary statistics and prevalence of victimization. The UN-CTS data collection is largely based on the network of national Focal Points, which are institutions/officials appointed by countries and have the technical capacity and role to produce data on crime and criminal justice (around 130 appointed Focal Points as of 2016).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN-CTS collects data on reporting rate by victims respectively of &amp;#x201C;physical assault&amp;#x201D; and &amp;#x201C;sexual assault&amp;#x201D;. The current data collection is currently reviewed to collect data on this indicator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data for SDG monitoring will be sent to countries for consultation prior to publication &lt;/p&gt;</data>
