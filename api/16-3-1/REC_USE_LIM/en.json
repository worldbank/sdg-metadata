{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 16-3-1, translated into en","data":"<p>The target relates to the multidimensional concepts of rule of law and access to justice and at least two indicators are required to cover the main elements of access to justice and efficiency of the justice system. The indicator 16.3.1 covers an important aspect of victim&#x2019;s access to criminal justice, while it doesn&#xB4;t cover civil or administrative disputes. The indicator as formulated is a standard indicator widely published when a victimization survey is undertaken, but further work is required to enhance a consistent interpretation and application of this indicator. In particular, some important elements of this indicator needs methodological guidance, such as the type of violent crime to include beyond physical assault; counting rules regarding reporting rates (e.g. prevalence-based, incidence-based, based on last victimization experience) and the type of competent authorities to consider.</p>\n<p>Methodological guidance on these issues is currently under development.</p>"}
