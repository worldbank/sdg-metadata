	<message>The INST_MANDATE field for indicator 7-2-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;IEA as one of the custodian agencies responsible for monitoring progress towards the SDG 7.2 target, leverage on their national data efforts and add value by promoting coherent standards, definitions and methodologies for both raw data and the derived indicators with the ultimate goal of producing internationally comparable datasets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNSD mission in the area of energy statistics is to strengthen national statistical systems in order to assist countries to produce high quality energy statistics and balances. The mission is realized through four workstreams: Data collection (since 1950); Development of methodological guidelines and standards in energy statistics (e.g., IRES, ESCM); Capacity building (to disseminate such methodology and to assist countries to strengthen their energy statistical systems); and International cooperation and coordination. UNSD was selected as one of the custodians of indicator 7.2.1 because it collects for all countries the underlying data necessary to calculate the indicator. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
