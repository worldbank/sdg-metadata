	<message>The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 7-2-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The IEA has several internal procedures in place for energy data validation. This includes energy balance checks, time series analysis and reconciling differences in statistical classifications and definitions. UNSD also has a number of internal validation procedures to ensure internal data consistency, for instance through energy balance checks, and trend consistency, e.g. by way of time series analysis. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
