&lt;p&gt;The IEA World energy balances and the UN Energy Statistics Database, which provide the underlying data for calculating this indicator, are global databases obtained following harmonised definitions and comparable methodologies across countries. However, they do not represent an official source for national submissions of the indicator 7.3.1 on energy efficiency. Due to possible deviations from IRES in national methodologies, national indicators may differ from the internationally comparable ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Difference may arise due to different sources of official energy data, dissimilarities in the underlying methodologies, adjustments and estimations.&lt;/p&gt;
