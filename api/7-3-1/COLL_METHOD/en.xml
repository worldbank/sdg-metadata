	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 7-3-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The IEA collects energy data at the national level according to harmonised international definitions and questionnaires, as described in the UN International Recommendations for Energy Statistics available at : (&lt;a href=&quot;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/methodology/ires&quot;&gt;unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/methodology/ires&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNSD also collects energy statistics from countries according to the same harmonised methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent GDP estimates published by the World Bank with reference year of 2017 have been used when calculating this indicator. Additionally, missing years for countries with at least one data point for GDP reported by the World Bank have been estimated using National Accounts &amp;#x2013; Analysis of Main Aggregates (AMA) growth rates.&lt;/p&gt;
