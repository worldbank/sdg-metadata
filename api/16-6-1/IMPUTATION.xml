&lt;p&gt;As the data collection is a complex process in finding the sources of information, the number of countries increases every year and the missing values are constantly filled. The target is to collect data for new countries and to fill the gap years for existing countries. Example: in 2018 the available data was for 60 countries, in 2023 the data is available for 171. In the current 2023 annual data collection - 16 new countries were added to the existing pool of data. It is expected that based on the created network, in the future data will be collected only for the last fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#x2022; At regional and global levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regional aggregation according the UN regions is done annually, based on the collected data.&lt;/p&gt;
