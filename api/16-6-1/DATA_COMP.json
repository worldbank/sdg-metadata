{"status":"success","message":"The DATA_COMP field for indicator 16-6-1, translated into all languages","data":{"ar":"","en":"<p>The methodology for calculating this indicator is provided in a spreadsheet (titled &#x201C;En PI-1 and PI-2 Exp Calculation-Feb 1 2016 (xls)&#x201D;) on the PEFA website (http://www.pefa.org/en/content/pefa-2016-framework). It is also detailed in part 2 of the document &#x201C;Framework for assessing public financial management&#x201D; (https://www.pefa.org/sites/pefa.org/files/attachments/PEFA%20Framework_English.pdf).</p>\n<p>Scoring is at the heart of the indicator. A country is scored separately on a four-point ordinal scale: A, B, C, or D, according to precise criteria: </p>\n<p>(A) Aggregate expenditure outturn was between 95% and 105% of the approved aggregate budgeted expenditure in at least two of the last three years.</p>\n<p>(B) Aggregate expenditure outturn was between 90% and 110% of the approved aggregate budgeted expenditure in at least two of the last three years.</p>\n<p>(C Aggregate expenditure outturn was between 85% and 115% of the approved aggregate budgeted expenditure in at least two of the last three years.</p>\n<p>(D) Performance is less than required for a C score.</p>\n<p>In order to justify a particular score, every aspect specified in the scoring requirements must be fulfilled. If the requirements are only partly met, the criteria are not satisfied and a lower score should be given that coincides with achievement of all requirements for the lower performance rating. A score of C reflects the basic level of performance for each indicator and dimension, consistent with good international practices. A score of D means that the feature being measured is present at less than the basic level of performance or is absent altogether, or that there is insufficient information to score the dimension.</p>\n<p>The D score indicates performance that falls below the basic level. &#x2018;D&#x2019; is applied if the performance observed is less than required for any higher score. For this reason, a D score is warranted when sufficient information is not available to establish the actual level of performance. A score of D due to insufficient information is distinguished from D scores for low-level performance by the use of an asterisk&#x2014;that is, D* at the dimension level. The asterisk is not included at the indicator level.</p>\n<p>The coverage is budgetary central government (BCG) and requires data for three consecutive years as a basis for assessment. The data would cover the most recent completed fiscal year for which data is available and the two immediately preceding years.</p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
