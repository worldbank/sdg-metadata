			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;ILO provides ongoing support to National Statistical Offices with planning and conducting household surveys covering measurement of migrant recruitment costs, as well as with the analysis of the results and report drafting. Results are assessed in terms of achieved sample size, standard errors associated with the main results, issues with disaggregation by essential characteristics and potential coverage issues. Results for selected pilot survey implementations are available in the ILO website at: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/fair-recruitment/WCMS_726736/lang--en/index.htm&quot;&gt;https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/fair-recruitment/WCMS_726736/lang--en/index.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
