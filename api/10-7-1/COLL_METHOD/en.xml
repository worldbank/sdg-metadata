	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 10-7-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The statistics collected for this indicator should be recognized at the national level as official statistics by the proper authorities in the country producing them, e.g. the National Statistical Office (NSO), the Ministry of Labour (MoL), or other official agency within the system for national official statistics. The NSO, MoL or other official agency should be the counterpart for the collection of statistics on SDG 10.7.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey data will be collected by NSO using already existing survey instruments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Survey data: A standalone and succinct module and a set of questions is being developed by the custodians to ensure a harmonized approach in the countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The module will be made available to NSO for integration in household survey instruments already in place and will be used by other international household survey programs working with NSO, (such as LSMS and UIS), and can be used by any other complementary survey instrument that meet the SDG quality requirements, while producing data approved and reported by NSO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capacity building material will be developed. A tailor-made approach will be applied, where each country will be assisted, upon request, with integration of the essential questions in existing survey instruments and customization. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
