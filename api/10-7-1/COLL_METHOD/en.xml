	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 10-7-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;To calculate the SDG indicator 10.7.1, information on costs and earnings should be collected at person level for the target population (e.g. international migrant workers and/or international return migrant workers). The selected household survey should use a sampling strategy and data collection instrument (questionnaire) designed to gather representative statistics for the concerned country and/or corridors, if major bilateral migration corridors are targeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a country of origin the sampling strategy may have to be modified to over- sample in regions/villages from which migrant workers are most frequently recruited, to obtain a large enough number of target group respondents for sufficiently precise estimates. Different strategies could be used to design an adequate sampling frame including use of area sampling, use of electricity/mobile bills, combine the information from household surveys with establishment surveys and other administrative registries, where available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a destination country, the sampling frame for the household survey may, in addition, need to be supplemented with a frame covering collective households (workers&amp;#x2019; residence, dormitories) likely to serve as dwellings for international migrant workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, questions on the costs and earnings of migrant workers need to be added to the existing standard questionnaire in both origin and destination countries, such as by adding a migration module or including survey questions on recruitment costs in an existing migration module. Model recruitment costs modules and operational guidance, aligned with the &lt;em&gt;draft Guidelines for the collection of statistics for SDG indicator 10.7.1&lt;/em&gt;, are available in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---migrant/documents/publication/wcms_745663.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Operational Manual on Recruitment Costs -SDG 10.7.1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (December 2019) prepared by the ILO and World Bank as co-custodian agencies.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
