{"status":"success","message":"The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 10-7-1, translated into en","data":"<p>Statistics on SDG indicator 10.7.1 should be collected primarily by using existing data collection systems, particularly household-based surveys. This will ensure coherence with existing national sources, methodologies and sampling frames, including types of interviews, field organization, etc. It will also contribute to the long-term sustainability of data collection on this topic. </p>\n<p>A large-scale national household survey strategy has two advantages: a) a survey of this type may already have been well established in the country of origin as well as in host countries; and b) this type of survey may already collect some of the relevant information from the members of the household (even from absent members in the country of origin).</p>\n<p>The most appropriate surveys to include measurement of SDG 10.7.1 include household-based surveys designed to capture the target population, such as a dedicated migration survey, if these exist in the country, as well as national large-scale household surveys covering closely related topics, particularly employment and/or earnings (such as a labour force survey, household income and expenditure survey, or multi-purpose surveys that include questions on employment and migration). Data collected through household surveys could be complemented with establishment surveys for destination countries, and administrative records. In cases where such data are not available, as a last recourse, shorter traveller surveys of migrant workers at ports of departure/entry may be considered. </p>"}
