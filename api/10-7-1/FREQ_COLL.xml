			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;SDG 10.7.1 is a tier II indicator since October 2019. At present, National Statistical Offices are at different stages of piloting the current methodology and data collection strategy at nationa level. It is recommended that National Statistical Offices in countries with important inflows or outflows of international migrant workers and/or international return migrant workers collect statistics on SDG 10.7.1 every few years, so as to monitor trends and inform policy formulation and planning. &lt;/p&gt;
