	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 10-7-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The proposed Guidelines have recommended using one month of earnings as the denominator, and to express the indicator as the proportion of monthly earnings paid by the migrant worker to obtain the job abroad. The Guidelines recognize as most relevant for calculation of recruitment costs the earnings of the first job held in the last or most recent country of destination. However monthly earnings of migrant workers may vary considerably for each month worked, particularly if migrant workers often change their job during their first 12 months abroad. Accordingly, the Guidelines recommend using the actual income received for the first month of employment, including bonuses and other earnings (e.g. for over-time work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall may be an issue if the first job abroad was undertaken many years ago. The Guidelines suggests that when developing the data collection system, the focus should be on international migrant workers or international return migrant workers who started their first job in their last or most recent country of destination within a recent past period (e.g. in the last 3 years prior to the date of measurement).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
