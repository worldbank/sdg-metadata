	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 10-7-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The proposed Guidelines have recommended using one month of earnings as the denominator, and to express the indicator as the proportion of monthly earnings paid by the migrant worker to obtain the job abroad. The Guidelines recommend using earnings of the last month of the first job abroad. However monthly earnings of migrant workers may vary considerably for each month worked, particularly if migrant workers often change their job during their first 12 months abroad. Accordingly, the Guidelines recommend using the first job abroad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall may be an issue if the first job abroad was undertaken many years ago. The Guidelines suggests that when developing the data collection system, the focus should be on migrant workers whose first job abroad happened less than a given period, such as 3 years prior or less.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
