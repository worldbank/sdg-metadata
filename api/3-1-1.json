This database is used to determine the number of maternal deaths and where possible the number of deaths among all women of reproductive age (WRA) to calculate the &quot;PM&quot; proportion of maternal deaths among WRA. The MMR is then calculated as MMR = PM(D/B); where &quot;D&quot; is the number of deaths in women aged 15-49 (WRA) and &quot;B&quot; is the number of live births. The number of live births is based upon the World Population Prospects 2019. </p>\n<p>Statistical modelling is undertaken to generate comparable country, regional, and global level estimates. The model&apos;s fit is assessed by cross-validation. Estimates are then reviewed with Member States through a WHO country consultation process and SDG focal points. In 2001, the WHO Executive Board endorsed a resolution (EB. 107.R8) seeking to &#x201C;establish a technical consultation process bringing together personnel and perspectives from Member States in different WHO regions&#x201D;. A key objective of this consultation process is &#x201C;to ensure that each Member State is consulted on the best data to be used&#x201D;. Since the process is an integral step in the overall estimation strategy, it is described here in brief.</p>\n<p>The country consultation process entails an exchange between WHO and technical focal person(s) in each country. It is carried out prior to the publication of estimates. During the consultation period, WHO invites focal person(s) to review input data sources, methods for estimation and the preliminary estimates. Focal person(s) are encouraged to submit additional data that may not have been taken into account in the preliminary estimates.</p>\n<p>Adjustments are made according to the data source type:</p>\n<p>(1) CRVS, for incompleteness and misclassification of maternal deaths</p>\n<p>(2) reports providing &quot;pregnancy-related&quot; mortality, for underreporting of these deaths, as well as over-reporting of maternal deaths due to inclusion of deaths which are accidental or incidental to pregnancy (thus outside of the definition of maternal mortality). </p>\n<p>The analysis also accounts for stochastic errors due to the general rarity of maternal deaths, sampling error in the data source, errors during data collection and processing, and other random error.</p><h1>Calendar</h1>\n<h2>Data collection:</h2>\n<p>Source data are collected by countries, typically yearly for CRVS sources, every 3-5 years for specialized reviews, every 5-7 years for population-based surveys, every 10 years for censuses. </p><h2>Data release:</h2>\n<p>The next round of MMR estimation is scheduled for publication 2022.</p><h1>Data providers</h1>\n<p>National level data providers may be statistical offices, specialized epi monitoring bodies and Ministry of Health.</p><h1>Data compilers</h1>\n<p>MMEIG the Maternal Mortality Estimation Interagency Group, composed of: WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, The World Bank Group and UN Population Division.</p><h2>Rationale:</h2>\n<p>All maternal mortality indicators derived from the 2019 estimation round include a point-estimate and an 80% uncertainty interval (UI). Data are available and can be downloaded from the webpage &#x201C;maternal mortality &#x2013; levels and trends 2000-2017: <a href=\"http://mmr2017.srhr.org\">http://mmr2017.srhr.org</a>. Both point-estimates and 80% UIs should be taken into account when assessing estimates.</p>\n<p>For example: </p>\n<p>The estimated 2017 global MMR is 211 (UI 199 to 243)</p>\n<p>This means:</p>\n<p>&#x2022; The point-estimate is 211 and the 80% uncertainty interval ranges 199 to 243.</p>\n<p>&#x2022; There is a 50% chance that the true 2017 global MMR lies above 211, and a 50% chance that the true value lies below 211.</p>\n<p>&#x2022; There is an 80% chance that the true 2017 global MMR lies between 199 and 243.</p>\n<p>&#x2022; There is still a 10% chance that the true 2017 global MMR lies above 243, and a 10% chance that the true value lies below 199.</p>\n<p>Other accurate interpretations include:</p>\n<p>&#x2022; We are 90% certain that the true 2017 global MMR is at least 199.</p>\n<p>&#x2022; We are 90% certain that the true 2017 global MMR is 243 or less.</p>\n<p>The amount of data available for estimating an indicator and the quality of that data determine the width of an indicator&#x2019;s UI. As data availability and quality improve, the certainty increases that an indicator&#x2019;s true value lies close to the point-estimate.</p><h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n<p>The extent of maternal mortality in a population is essentially the combination of two factors:</p>\n<p>i. The risk of death in a single pregnancy or a single live birth.</p>\n<p>ii. The fertility level (i.e. the number of pregnancies or births that are experienced by women of reproductive age).</p>\n<p>The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100 000 live births during the same time period. It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live births and essentially captures (i) above.</p>\n<p>By contrast, the maternal mortality rate (MMRate) is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by person-years lived by women of reproductive age. The MMRate captures both the risk of maternal death per pregnancy or per total birth (live birth or stillbirth), and the level of fertility in the population. In addition to the MMR and the MMRate, it is possible to calculate the adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality for women in the population. An alternative measure of maternal mortality, the proportion of deaths among women of reproductive age that are due to maternal causes (PM), is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by the total deaths among women aged 15&#x2013;49 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Related statistical measures of maternal mortality:</strong></p>\n<p>Maternal mortality ratio (MMR): Number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time period.</p>\n<p>Maternal mortality rate (MMRate): Number of maternal deaths divided by person-years lived by women of reproductive age.</p>\n<p>Adult lifetime risk of maternal death: The probability that a 15-year-old woman will die eventually from a maternal cause.</p>\n<p>The proportion of deaths among women of reproductive age that are due to maternal causes (PM): The number of maternal deaths in a given time period divided by the total deaths among women aged 15&#x2013;49 years.</p><h1>Methodology</h1>\n<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n<p>The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated by dividing recorded (or estimated) maternal deaths by total recorded (or estimated) live births in the same period and multiplying by 100 000. Measurement requires information on pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death.</p>\n<p>The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated directly from data collected through vital registration systems, household surveys or other sources. There are often data quality problems, particularly related to the underreporting and misclassification of maternal deaths. Therefore, data are often adjusted in order to take these data quality issues into account. Some countries undertake these adjustments or corrections as part of specialized/confidential enquiries or administrative efforts embedded within maternal mortality monitoring programmes.</p>\n<p><strong>Bayesian maternal mortality estimation model (the BMat model):</strong></p>\n<p>Estimation and projection of maternal mortality indicators are undertaken using the BMat model. This model is intended to ensure that the MMR estimation approach is consistent across all countries but remains flexible in that it is based on covariate-driven trends to inform estimates in countries or country-periods with limited information; captures observed trends in countries with longer time series of observations; and takes into account the differences in stochastic and sampling errors across observations.</p>\n<p>The model is summarized as follows:</p>\n<p><img

obtain the expected non-HIV MMR through the following relationship:</p>\n<p>Expected non-HIV MMR =EPM<sup>NA</sup>*(1-a)*E/B</p>\n<p>where</p>\n<p>a = the proportion of HIV-related deaths among all deaths to women aged 15&#x2013;49 years</p>\n<p>E = the total number of deaths to women of reproductive age</p>\n<p>B = the number of births.</p>\n<p>Estimation of HIV-related indirect maternal deaths:</p>\n<p>For countries with generalized HIV epidemics and high HIV prevalence, HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of death during pregnancy and post-delivery. There is also some evidence from community studies that women with HIV infection have a higher risk of maternal death, although this may be offset by lower fertility. If HIV is prevalent, there will also be more incidental HIV deaths among pregnant and postpartum women. When estimating maternal mortality in these countries, it is, thus, important to differentiate between incidental HIV deaths (non-maternal deaths) and HIV-related indirect maternal deaths (maternal deaths caused by the aggravating effects of pregnancy on HIV) among HIV-positive pregnant and postpartum women who have died (i.e. among all HIV-related deaths occurring during pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium).</p>\n<p>The number of HIV-related indirect<strong><em> </em></strong>maternal deaths, <em>D<sup>HIV</sup>, </em>is estimated by:</p>\n<p><em>D<sup>HIV </sup>= a * E * v * u</em></p>\n<p>Where</p>\n<p><em>a*E</em> = the total number of HIV-related deaths among all deaths to women aged 15&#x2013;49.</p>\n<p><em>v  = </em>is the proportion of HIV-related deaths to women aged 15&#x2013;49 that occur during pregnancy. The value of <em>v </em>can be computed as follows: <em>v&#xA0;</em>=&#xA0;<em>c k GFR / [</em>1 + <em>c</em>(<em>k-</em>1) <em>GFR] </em>where<strong> </strong>GFR is the general fertility rate, and where<em> c  </em>is the average exposure time (in years) to the risk of pregnancy-related mortality per live birth (set equal to 1 for this analysis), and where <em>k  </em>is the relative risk of dying from AIDS for a pregnant versus a non-pregnant woman (reflecting both the decreased fertility of HIV-positive women and the increased mortality risk of HIV-positive pregnant women). The value of k was set at 0.3.</p>\n<p>u = is the fraction of pregnancy-related AIDS deaths assumed to be indirect maternal deaths. The UN&#xA0;MMEIG/TAG reviewed available study data on AIDS deaths among pregnant women and recommended using <em>u&#xA0;=&#xA0;</em>0.3.</p>\n<p>For observed PMs, we assumed that the total reported maternal deaths are a combination of the proportion of reported non-HIV-related maternal deaths and the proportion of reported HIV-related (indirect) maternal deaths, where the latter is given by <em>a*v</em> for observations with a &#x201C;pregnancy-related death&#x201D; definition and <em>a*v*u</em> for observations with a &#x201C;maternal death&#x201D; definition.</p><h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>\n  <li><strong><em>At regional and global levels:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>To inform projection of trends across periods where data are sparse, or for countries with little or no data at all, the BMaT statistical model is used to estimate maternal mortality. The model includes factors known to be associated with maternal mortality as predictor covariates (GDP, GFR and SAB).</p><h2>Regional aggregates:</h2>\n<p>The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated by dividing recorded (or estimated) maternal deaths by total recorded (or estimated) live births in the same period and multiplying by 100,000. Measurement requires information on pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death.</p>\n<p>The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated directly from data collected through vital registration systems, household surveys or other sources. There are often data quality problems, particularly related to the underreporting and misclassification of maternal deaths. Therefore, data are often adjusted in order to take these data quality issues into account.</p>\n<p>Because maternal mortality is a relatively rare event, large sample sizes are needed if household surveys are used to identify recent maternal deaths in the household (e.g. last year). This may still result in estimates with large confidence intervals, limiting the usefulness for cross-country or over-time comparisons.</p>\n<p>To reduce sample size requirements, the sisterhood method used in the DHS and multiple indicator surveys (MICS) measures maternal mortality by asking respondents about the survival of sisters. It should be noted that the sisterhood method results in pregnancy-related mortality: regardless of the cause of death, all deaths occurring during pregnancy, birth or the six weeks following the termination of the pregnancy are included in the numerator of the maternal mortality ratio.</p>\n<p>Censuses have also included questions about maternal deaths with variable success.</p>\n<p>Reproductive Age Mortality Studies (RAMOS) is a special study that uses varied sources, depending on the context, to identify maternal deaths; no single source identifies all the deaths. Interviews with household members and health-care providers and reviews of facility records are used to classify the deaths as maternal or otherwise. If properly conducted, this approach provides a fairly complete estimation of maternal mortality (in the absence of reliable routine registration systems) and could provide subnational MMRs. However, inadequate identification of all deaths of reproductive-aged wom</p>\n<p>en results in underestimation of maternal mortality levels. This approach can be complicated, time-consuming and expensive to undertake &#x2013; particularly on a large scale. The number of live births used in the computation may not be accurate, especially in settings where most women deliver at home. </p>\n<p>WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, The World Bank Group, and the United Nations Population Division have developed a method to adjust existing data in order to take into account these data quality issues and ensure the comparability of different data sources. This method involves assessment of data for completeness and, where necessary, adjustment for incompleteness and misclassification of deaths as well as development of estimates through statistical modelling for countries with no reliable national level data.</p>\n<p>Data on maternal mortality and other relevant variables are obtained through databases maintained by WHO, the United Nations Population Division, UNICEF, and The World Bank Group. Data available from countries varies in terms of source and methods. Given the variability of the sources of data, different methods are used for each data source in order to arrive at country estimates that are comparable and permit regional and global aggregation.</p>\n<p>Currently, only about one third of all countries/territories have reliable data available and do not need additional estimations. For about half of the countries included in the estimation process, country-reported estimates of maternal mortality are adjusted for the purposes of comparability of the methodologies. For the remainder of countries/territories &#x2013; those with no appropriate maternal mortality data -- a statistical model is employed to predict maternal mortality levels. However, the calculated point estimates with this methodology might not represent the true levels of maternal mortality. It is advised to consider the estimates together with the reported uncertainty margins within which the true levels are known to lie.</p>\n<p>Details on adjustments and formulas are published/available here:</p>\n<p>(1) Peterson E, Chou D, Gemmill A, Moller AB, Say L, Alkema L.

Out of 185 countries and territories, 177 have nationally representative data.</p>\n<h2>Disaggregation:</h2>\n<p>Current MMR estimates are reported at Country, Regional, and Global levels. Regional level estimates have income strata per World Bank classification, by UNICEF and UNFPA regional groupings</p><h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>\n<p>The maternal mortality ratio is defined as the number of maternal deaths divided by live births. However, to account for potential incompleteness of death recording in various data sources, the MMEIG first computes the fraction of deaths due to maternal causes from original data sources (referred to as the &#x201C;proportion maternal&#x201D;, or PM), and then applies that fraction to WHO estimates of total deaths among women of reproductive age to obtain an estimate of the number of maternal deaths. </p>\n<p>In other words, the following fraction is first computed from country data sources:</p>\n<p>PM= Number of maternal deaths 15-49/All female deaths at ages 15-49 </p>\n<p>and then the PM is used to compute the MMR as follows:</p>\n<p>MMR=PM &#xD7; (All female deaths at ages 15-49/Number of live births)</p>\n<p>where the estimate of all deaths at ages 15-49 in the second equation is derived from WHO life tables, and the number of live births is from the World Population Prospects 201.</p>\n<p>With this as background, a few reasons that MMEIG estimates may differ from national statistics are as follows:</p>\n<p>1. Civil registration and vital statistics systems are not always complete (i.e., they do not always capture 100% of all deaths) and completeness may change over time. The MMEIG estimation approach attempts to correct for this by using the above approach, which involves first computing the PM.</p>\n<p>2. The MMEIG often applies adjustment factors to the PM computed from original data to account for measurement issues (such as how the country defined &#x201C;maternal&#x201D; deaths; misclassification; or incompleteness). </p>\n<p>3. The MMEIG uses the standardized series of live births from the United Nations Population Division, as published in World Population Prospects 2019, in the denominator of the MMR equation. To better inform the WPP, countries should discuss discrepancies directly with the UNPD. The contact address is population@un.org; this email address is monitored regularly, and messages are dispatched to the appropriate analysts for each country or concern. </p>\n<p>4. Statistically speaking, maternal deaths are a relatively rare event, which can lead to noisy time trends in data over time. As the goal of the MMEIG estimates is to track long term progress in reducing maternal mortality, the estimation process involves some smoothing to generate a curve that better captures changes in underlying risk.</p><h1>References</h1>\n<h2>URL:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/maternal-mortality-2000-2017/en/\">https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/maternal-mortality-2000-2017/en/</a></p>\n<h2>References:</h2>\n<p>(1) World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children&#x2019;s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), World Bank Group, United Nations Population Division.

Cette base de données est utilisée pour déterminer le nombre de décès maternels et si possible le nombre de décès parmi toutes les femmes en âge de procréer (WRA) afin de calculer la proportion « PM » de décès maternels parmi les WRA. Le MMR est ensuite calculé comme suit : MMR = PM(D/B) ; où « D » est le nombre de décès chez les femmes âgées de 15 à 49 ans (WRA) et « B » est le nombre de naissances vivantes. Le nombre de naissances vivantes est basé sur les Perspectives de la population mondiale 2019. </p>\n<p>La modélisation statistique est entreprise pour générer des estimations comparables aux niveaux national, régional et mondial. L'ajustement du modèle est évalué par validation croisée. Les estimations sont ensuite examinées avec les États membres dans le cadre d'un processus de consultation des pays de l'OMS et des points focaux du ODD. En 2001, le Conseil exécutif de l'OMS a approuvé une résolution (EB. 107.R8) visant à « établir un processus de consultation technique réunissant le personnel et les points de vue des États membres dans différentes régions de l'OMS ». Un objectif clé de ce processus de consultation est de «veiller à ce que chaque État membre soit consulté sur les meilleures données à utiliser ». Comme le processus fait partie intégrante de la stratégie globale d'estimation, il est décrit ici en bref. </p>\n<p>Le processus de consultation des pays implique un échange entre l'OMS et le(s) responsable(s) technique(s) dans chaque pays. Il est effectué avant la publication des estimations. Pendant la période de consultation, l'OMS invite le(s) correspondant(s) à examiner les sources de données d'entrée, les méthodes d'estimation et les estimations préliminaires. Le ou les correspondants sont encouragés à soumettre des données supplémentaires qui pourraient ne pas avoir été prises en compte dans les estimations préliminaires. </p>\n<p>Les ajustements sont effectués en fonction du type de source de données : </p>\n<p>(1) CRVS, pour incomplétude et classification erronée des décès maternels </p>\n<p>(2) qui fournit des rapports sur la mortalité « liée à la grossesse » pour la sous-déclaration de ces décès, ainsi que sur la sur-déclaration des décès maternels en raison de l'inclusion des décès accidentels ou liés à la grossesse (donc en dehors de la définition de la mortalité maternelle). </p>\n<p> L'analyse tient également compte des erreurs stochastiques dues à la rareté générale des décès maternels, des erreurs d'échantillonnage dans la source de données, des erreurs lors de la collecte et du traitement des données, et d'autres erreurs aléatoires. </p><h1>Calendrier</h1>\n<h2>Collecte de données :</h2>\n<p>Les données de base sont collectées par les pays, généralement chaque année pour les sources CRVS, tous les 3 à 5 ans pour les revues spécialisées, tous les 5 à 7 ans pour les enquêtes de population, tous les 10 ans pour les recensements. </p><h2>Publication des données :</h2>\n<p>Le prochain cycle d'estimation du TMM est prévu pour la publication en 2022. </p><h1>Fournisseurs de données</h1>\n<p>Les fournisseurs de données au niveau national peuvent être des bureaux de statistiques, des organismes spécialisés dans la surveillance de l'épi et le ministère de la Santé. </p><h1>Compilateurs de données </h1>\n<p>MMEIG le Groupe Inter-agences d'Estimation de la Mortalité Maternelle, composé de : OMS, UNICEF, FNUAP, Groupe de la Banque mondiale et Division de la population de l'ONU. </p><h2>Justification :</h2>\n<p>Tous les indicateurs de mortalité maternelle dérivés du cycle d'estimation de 2019 comprennent une estimation ponctuelle et un intervalle d'incertitude (UI) de 80 %. Les données sont disponibles et peuvent être téléchargées sur la page web « maternal mortality &#x2013; levels and trends 2000-2017 : <a href=\"http://mmr2017.srhr.org\">http://mmr2017.srhr.org</a>. Les estimations ponctuelles et l'intervalle d'incertitude de 80 % doivent être pris en compte lors de l'évaluation des estimations. </p>\n<p> Par exemple : </p>\n<p>Le TMM mondial estimé pour 2017 est de 211 (UI 199 à 243)</p>\n<p>Cela signifie : </p>\n<p> &#x2022; L'estimation ponctuelle est de 211 et l'intervalle d'incertitude de 80% va de 199 à 243. </p>\n<p> &#x2022; Il y a 50% de chances que le véritable TMM mondial de 2017 soit supérieur à 211, et 50% de chances que la valeur réelle soit inférieure à 211. </p>\n<p> &#x2022;Il y a 80 % de chances que le véritable TMM mondial de 2017 se situe entre 199 et 243. </p>\n<p> &#x2022; Il y a encore 10 % de chances que le véritable TMM mondial de 2017 soit supérieur à 243, et 10 % de chances que la valeur réelle soit inférieure à 199. </p>\n<p>Parmi les autres interprétations précises, on peut citer : </p>\n<p> &#x2022; Nous sommes sûrs à 90 % que le véritable TMM mondial de 2017 est d'au moins 199. </p>\n<p> &#x2022; Nous sommes sûrs à 90 % que le véritable TMM mondial de 2017 est de 243 ou moins. </p>\n<p>La quantité de données disponibles pour l'estimation d'un indicateur et la qualité de ces données déterminent la largeur de l'UI d'un indicateur. À mesure que la disponibilité et la qualité des données s'améliorent, la certitude augmente que la valeur réelle d'un indicateur est proche de l'estimation ponctuelle. </p><h2>Commentaires et limites : </h2>\n<p> L'ampleur de la mortalité maternelle dans une population est essentiellement la combinaison de deux facteurs :</p>\n<p>i. Le risque de décès lors d'une seule grossesse ou d'une seule naissance vivante. </p>\n<p>ii. Le niveau de fertilité (c'est-à-dire le nombre de grossesses ou de naissances que connaissent les femmes en âge de procréer). </p>\n<p>Le taux de mortalité maternelle (TMM) est défini comme le nombre de décès maternels pendant une période donnée pour 100 000 naissances vivantes au cours de la même période. Il décrit le risque de décès maternel par rapport au nombre de naissances vivantes et reprend essentiellement le point (i) ci-dessus.</p>\n<p>En revanche, le taux de mortalité maternelle (MMRate) est calculé comme le nombre de décès maternels divisé par les années-personnes vécues par les femmes en âge de procréer. Le taux de mortalité maternelle saisit à la fois le risque de décès maternel par grossesse ou par naissance totale (naissance vivante ou mort-né) et le niveau de fertilité de la population. En plus du TMM et du taux de mortalité maternelle, il est possible de calculer le risque de mortalité maternelle des femmes de la population pendant leur vie adulte. Une autre mesure de la mortalité maternelle, la proportion de décès chez les femmes en âge de procréer qui sont dus à des causes maternelles (MP), est calculée comme le nombre de décès maternels divisé par le total des décès chez les femmes âgées de 15 &#x2013;49 ans. </p>\n<p><strong>Mesures statistiques connexes de la mortalité maternelle : </strong></p>\n<p>Taux de mortalité maternelle (TMM) : Nombre de décès maternels au cours d'une période donnée pour 100 000 naissances vivantes au cours de la même période. </p>\n<p>Taux de mortalité maternelle (MMRate) : Nombre de décès maternels divisé par le nombre d'années-personnes vécues par les femmes en âge de procréer. </p>\n<p>Risque de décès maternel au cours de la vie d'un adulte : La probabilité qu'une femme de 15 ans meure éventuellement d'une cause maternelle. </p>\n<p>Proportion de décès de femmes en âge de procréer qui sont dus à des causes maternelles (PM) : Le nombre de décès maternels au cours d'une période donnée divisé par le nombre total de décès chez les femmes âgées de 15 ans &#x2013;49 ans. </p><h1>Méthodologie</h1>\n<h2>Méthode de calcul :</h2>\n<p>Le taux de mortalité maternelle peut être calculé en divisant les décès maternels enregistrés (ou estimés) par le total des naissances vivantes enregistrées (ou estimées) au cours de la même période et en multipliant par 100 000. La mesure exige de l’information sur l’état de la grossesse, le moment du décès (pendant la grossesse, l’accouchement ou dans les 42 jours suivant l’interruption de grossesse) et la cause du décès.</p>\n<p> le taux de mortalité maternelle peut être calculé directement à partir des données recueillies au moyen de systèmes d’enregistrement vitaux, d’enquêtes auprès des ménages ou d’autres sources. Il y a souvent des problèmes de qualité des données, en particulier liés à la sous-déclaration et à la classification erronée des décès maternels. Par conséquent, les données sont souvent ajustées afin de tenir compte de ces problèmes de qualité des données. Certains pays entreprennent ces ajustements ou corrections dans le cadre d’enquêtes spécialisées/confidentielles ou d’efforts administratifs intégrés aux programmes de surveillance de la mortalité maternelle.</p>\n<p><strong> Modèle d’estimation de la mortalité maternelle bayésienne (le modèle BMat) : </strong></p>\n<p> Estimation et projection des indicateurs de mortalité maternelle sont entreprises à l’aide du modèle BMat. Ce modèle vise à s’assurer que l’approche d’estimation du RMM est uniforme dans tous les pays, mais qu’elle demeure souple en ce qu’elle est fondée sur des tendances axées sur la covariation afin

liés au VIH a été calculée sur la base des effets aléatoires nationaux et régionaux, tandis que pour les pays ne disposant pas de données, les prévisions ont été établies en utilisant uniquement les effets aléatoires régionaux. </p>\n<p>Les estimations résultantes du <em>EPM<sup>NA </sup></em> ont été utilisées pour obtenir le TMM non-VIH attendu par le biais de la relation suivante:</p> \n<p>RMM attendu non-VIH =EPM<sup>NA</sup>*(1-a)*E/B</p>\n<p>où</p>\n<p>a = la proportion de décès liés au VIH parmi tous les décès de femmes âgées de 15&#x2013;49 ans</p>\n<p>E = le nombre total de décès de femmes en âge de procréer</p>\n<p>B = le nombre de naissances.</p>\n<p>Estimation des décès maternels indirects liés au VIH:</p>\n<p>Pour les pays où l'épidémie de VIH est généralisée et où la prévalence du VIH est élevée, le VIH/sida est une cause majeure de décès pendant la grossesse et après l'accouchement. Des études communautaires ont également montré que les femmes infectées par le VIH courent un risque plus élevé de décès maternel, bien que ce risque puisse être compensé par une fécondité plus faible. Si le VIH est prévalent, il y aura également plus de décès accidentels dus au VIH chez les femmes enceintes et les femmes en post-partum. Lors de l'estimation de la mortalité maternelle dans ces pays, il est donc important de faire la différence entre les décès accidentels dus au VIH (décès non maternels) et les décès maternels indirects liés au VIH (décès maternels causés par les effets aggravants de la grossesse sur le VIH) chez les femmes enceintes et les femmes en post-partum séropositives qui sont décédées (c'est-à-dire parmi tous les décès liés au VIH survenus pendant la grossesse, l'accouchement et la puerpéralité).</p>\n<p>Le nombre de décès maternels indirects liés au VIH, <em> </em> </strong>, <em>D<sup>HIV</sup>, </em> est estimé par:</p> <p><em>D<sup>HIV </sup>= a * E * v * u</em></p>\n<p>Où</p>\n<p><em>a*E</em> = le nombre total de décès liés au VIH parmi tous les décès de femmes âgées de 15&#x2013;49.</p>\n<p><em>v = </em>est la proportion de décès liés au VIH chez les femmes âgées de 15&#x2013;49 qui surviennent pendant la grossesse. La valeur de <em>v </em> peut être calculée comme suit : <em>v&#xA0;</em>=&#xA0 ;<em>c k DFG / [</em>1 + <em>c</em>(<em>k-</em>1) <em>DFG] </em>où <forte> </forte>DFG est le taux de fertilité général, et où <em> c </em> est la durée moyenne d'exposition (en années) au risque de mortalité liée à la grossesse par naissance vivante (fixée à 1 pour cette analyse), et où <em>k </em>est le risque relatif de mourir du sida pour une femme enceinte par rapport à une femme non enceinte (reflétant à la fois la baisse de la fertilité des femmes séropositives et l'augmentation du risque de mortalité des femmes enceintes séropositives). La valeur de k a été fixée à 0,3.</p> <p>u = est la fraction des décès liés à la grossesse dus au sida que l'on suppose être des décès maternels indirects. L'UN&#xA0;MMEIG/TAG a examiné les données d'études disponibles sur les décès dus au SIDA chez les femmes enceintes et a recommandé d'utiliser <em>u&#xA0;=&#xA0;</em>0,3.</p>\n<p>Pour les MP observées, nous avons supposé que le total des décès maternels signalés est une combinaison de la proportion de décès maternels non liés au VIH et de la proportion de décès maternels (indirects) liés au VIH, cette dernière étant donnée par <em>a*v</em> pour les observations avec une définition « décès lié à la grossesse» et <em>a*v*u</em> pour les observations avec une définition «décès maternel».</p><h2> Traitement des valeurs manquantes :</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li> <strong> <em> Au niveau national :</em></strong></li>\n  <li> <strong> <em> Aux niveaux régional et mondial :</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p> Pour éclairer la projection des tendances entre les périodes où les données sont rares, ou pour les pays qui ont peu ou pas de données du tout, le modèle statistique BMaT est utilisé pour estimer la mortalité maternelle. Le modèle comprend des facteurs connus pour être associés à la mortalité maternelle en tant que covariés prédicteurs (PIB, DFG et BRS). </p><h2>Agrégats régionaux : </h2>\n<p>Le taux de mortalité maternelle peut être calculé en divisant les décès maternels enregistrés (ou estimés) par le nombre total de naissances vivantes enregistrées (ou estimées) au cours de la même période et en multipliant le résultat par 100 000. La mesure nécessite des informations sur l'état de la grossesse, le moment du décès (pendant la grossesse, l'accouchement ou dans les 42 jours suivant l'interruption de la grossesse) et la cause du décès. </p>\n<p>Le taux de mortalité maternelle peut être calculé directement à partir des données collectées par les systèmes d'état civil, les enquêtes sur les ménages ou d'autres sources. Il existe souvent des problèmes de qualité des données, notamment liés à la sous-déclaration et à la mauvaise classification des décès maternels. Par conséquent, les données sont souvent ajustées afin de prendre en compte ces problèmes de qualité des données. </p>\n<p>La mortalité maternelle étant un événement relativement rare, il est nécessaire de disposer d'échantillons de grande taille si l'on utilise des enquêtes auprès des ménages pour identifier les décès maternels récents dans le ménage (par exemple l'année dernière). Cela peut toujours donner lieu à des estimations avec des intervalles de confiance importants, ce qui limite l'utilité pour les comparaisons entre pays ou dans le temps. </p>\n<p>Afin de réduire la taille de l'échantillon, la méthode des sœurs utilisée dans les DHS et les enquêtes à indicateurs multiples (MICS) mesure la mortalité maternelle en interrogeant les répondants sur la survie des sœurs. Il convient de noter que la méthode des sœurs entraîne une mortalité liée à la grossesse : quelle que soit la cause du décès, tous les décès survenus pendant la grossesse, la naissance ou les six semaines suivant l'interruption de la grossesse sont inclus dans le numérateur du taux de mortalité maternelle.</p>\n<p> Les recensements ont également inclus des questions sur les décès maternels avec un succès variable.</p>\n<p>L'étude RAMOS (Reproductive Age Mortality Studies) est une étude spéciale qui utilise des sources variées, selon le contexte, pour identifier les décès maternels ; aucune source unique n'identifie tous les décès. Des entretiens avec les membres du ménage et les prestataires de soins de santé ainsi que l'examen des dossiers des établissements sont utilisés pour classer les décès comme étant maternels ou autres. Si elle est correctement menée, cette approche fournit une estimation assez complète de la mortalité maternelle (en l'absence de systèmes d'enregistrement de routine fiables) et pourrait fournir des RMM infranationaux. Cependant, l'identification inadéquate de tous les décès des femmes en âge de procréer entraîne une sous-estimation des niveaux de mortalité maternelle. Cette approche peut être compliquée, longue et coûteuse à mettre en œuvre &#x2013; en particulier à grande échelle. Le nombre de naissances vivantes utilisé dans le calcul peut ne pas être exact, en particulier dans des contextes où la plupart des femmes accouchent à domicile. </p>\n<p>L'OMS, l'UNICEF, le FNUAP, le Groupe de la Banque mondiale et la Division de la population des Nations unies ont mis au point une méthode pour ajuster les données existantes afin de prendre en compte ces problèmes de qualité des données et d'assurer la comparabilité des différentes sources de données. Cette méthode consiste à évaluer l'exhaustivité des données et, le cas échéant, à les ajuster pour tenir compte des lacunes et des erreurs de classification des décès, ainsi qu'à établir des estimations par modélisation statistique pour les pays qui ne disposent pas de données fiables au niveau national. </p>\n<p>Les données sur la mortalité maternelle et d'autres variables pertinentes sont obtenues par le biais de bases de données gérées par l'OMS, la Division de la population des Nations Unies, l'UNICEF et le Groupe de la Banque mondiale. Les données disponibles dans les pays varient en termes de source et de méthodes. Étant donné la variabilité des sources de données, différentes méthodes sont utilisées pour chaque source de données afin d'obtenir des estimations nationales comparables et permettant une agrégation régionale et mondiale.</p>\n<p>Actuellement, seul un tiers environ de tous les pays/territoires disposent de données fiables et n'ont pas besoin d'estimations supplémentaires. Pour environ la moitié des pays inclus dans le processus d'estimation, les estimations de la mortalité maternelle rapportées par les pays sont ajustées à des fins de comparabilité des méthodologies. Pour le reste des pays/territoires &#x2013; qui ne disposent pas de données appropriées sur la mortalité maternelle, un modèle statistique est utilisé pour prédire les niveaux de mortalité maternelle. Cependant, les estimations ponctuelles calculées avec cette méthodologie peuvent ne pas représenter les véritables niveaux de mortalité maternelle. Il est conseillé de considérer les estimations avec les marges d'incertitude déclarées dans lesquelles on sait que les niveaux réels se situent. </p>\n<p>Les détails sur les ajustements et les formules sont publiés/disponibles ici : </p>\n<p>(1) Peterson E, Chou D, Gemmill A, Moller AB, Say L, Alkema L.

Sur 185 pays et territoires, 177 disposent de données représentatives au niveau national.</p>\n<h2>Désagrégation :</h2>\n<p> Les estimations actuelles du TMM sont rapportées aux niveaux national, régional et mondial. Les estimations au niveau régional ont des strates de revenu selon la classification de la Banque mondiale, par les groupements régionaux de l'UNICEF et du FNUAP.</p><h2>Sources des écarts : </h2>\n<p>Le taux de mortalité maternelle est défini comme le nombre de décès maternels divisé par le nombre de naissances vivantes. Toutefois, pour tenir compte du caractère potentiellement incomplet de l'enregistrement des décès dans les différentes sources de données, le MMEIG calcule d'abord la fraction des décès dus à des causes maternelles à partir des sources de données originales (appelée la « proportion maternelle » ou PM), puis applique cette fraction aux estimations de l'OMS du nombre total de décès chez les femmes en âge de procréer pour obtenir une estimation du nombre de décès maternels. </p>\n<p>En d'autres termes, la fraction suivante est d'abord calculée à partir des sources de données des pays : </p>\n<p>PM= Nombre de décès maternels 15-49 ans/Tous les décès féminins à l'âge de 15-49 ans </p>\n<p> et ensuite le PM est utilisé pour calculer le MMR comme suit : </p>\n<p>MMR=PM &#xD7; (Tous les décès de femmes entre 15 et 49 ans/Nombre de naissances vivantes) </p>\n<p> où l'estimation de tous les décès entre 15 et 49 ans dans la deuxième équation est tirée des tables de survie de l'OMS, et le nombre de naissances vivantes est tiré du World Population Prospects 2019. </p>\n<p>Dans ce contexte, voici quelques raisons pour lesquelles les estimations du MMEIG peuvent différer des statistiques nationales :</p>\n<p>1. Les systèmes d'enregistrement des faits d'état civil et de statistiques de l'état civil ne sont pas toujours complets (c'est-à-dire qu'ils ne saisissent pas toujours 100 % de tous les décès) et cette complétude peut changer avec le temps. L'approche d'estimation du MMEIG tente de corriger cela en utilisant l'approche ci-dessus, qui implique de calculer d'abord les PM. </p>\n<p>2. Le MMEIG applique souvent des facteurs d'ajustement aux MP calculées à partir des données originales pour tenir compte des problèmes de mesure (tels que la façon dont le pays a défini les « décès maternels », une mauvaise classification ou un manque d'exhaustivité). </p>\n<p>3. Le MMEIG utilise la série standardisée de naissances vivantes de la Division de la population des Nations unies, telle que publiée dans World Population Prospects 2019, au dénominateur de l'équation du MMR. Pour mieux informer le WPP, les pays doivent discuter des écarts directement avec le UNPD. L'adresse de contact est population@un.org ; cette adresse électronique fait l'objet d'un suivi régulier et les messages sont envoyés aux analystes appropriés pour chaque pays ou préoccupation. </p>\n<p>4. Statistiquement parlant, les décès maternels sont un événement relativement rare, ce qui peut conduire à des tendances temporelles bruyantes dans les données au fil du temps. Comme l'objectif des estimations du MMEIG est de suivre les progrès à long terme dans la réduction de la mortalité maternelle, le processus d'estimation implique un certain lissage pour générer une courbe qui saisit mieux les changements du risque sous-jacent. </p><h1>Références</h1>\n<h2>URL : </h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/maternal-mortality-2000-2017/en/\">https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/maternal-mortality-2000-2017/en/</a></p>\n<h2>Références :</h2>\n<p>(1) Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS), Fonds des Nations unies pour l'enfance (UNICEF), Fonds des Nations unies pour la population (FNUAP), Groupe de la Banque mondiale, Division de la population des Nations unies.

Эта база данных используется для определения количества материнских смертей и, где это возможно, количества смертей среди всех женщин репродуктивного возраста (ЖРВ) для расчета «ДС» - доли материнских смертей среди женщин репродуктивного возраста. Затем коэффициент материнской смертности (КМС) рассчитывается по формуле MMR = PM(D/B); где MMR это КМС, PM это ДС, D - количество смертей среди женщин в возрасте 15-49 лет (ЖРВ) и \"B\"; количество живорождений. Количество живорождений взято на публикации \"Мировые демографические перспективы\" за 2019 год.</p>\n<p> Статистическое моделирование проводится для получения сопоставимых оценок на страновом, региональном и глобальном уровнях. Соответствие моделей оценивается перекрестной проверкой. Затем оценки пересматриваются совместно с государствами-членами в рамках процесса страновых консультаций ВОЗ и контактными лицами по ЦУР. В 2001 году Исполнительный комитет ВОЗ одобрил резолюцию (EB. 107.R8), направленную на организацию процесса технических консультаций, объединяющего сотрудников и заинтересованных лиц из государств-членов организации в различных регионах ВОЗ. Ключевая цель этого консультационного процесса - обеспечить проведение консультаций с каждым государством-членом по поводу использования наилучших данных. Поскольку этот процесс является неотъемлемым этапом общей стратегии осуществления оценки, он кратко описан здесь. </p>\n<p> Процесс консультаций со страной предполагает обмен информацией между ВОЗ и техническим контактным лицом или лицами в каждой стране. Эта процедура реализуется перед публикацией оценок. В течение периода консультаций ВОЗ приглашает контактных лиц для проверки источников исходных данных, методов оценки и предварительных оценок. Контактным лицам рекомендуется представлять дополнительные данные, которые могли быть не учтены в предварительных оценках. </p>\n<p> Корректировки сделаны в соответствии с типом источника данных: </p>\n<p> (1) данные государственной регистрации актов гражданского состояния и статистики естественного движения населения (CRVS) корректируются из-за неполноты и неправильной классификации материнской смертности </p>\n<p> (2) данные отчетов, содержащих смертность, «связанную с беременностью» корректируются из-за занижения данных по этим случаям смерти, а также из-за завышения количества случаев материнской смертности по причине включения смертей, произошедших от несчастных случаев или случайно возникших причин, не имеющих отношения к беременности (таким образом, не входящих в определение материнской смертности). </p>\n<p> В анализе также учитываются стохастические ошибки из-за того, что случаи материнской смерти происходят очень редко, а также из-за ошибок выборки в источнике данных, ошибок во время сбора и обработки данных и других случайных ошибок.</p><h1> Календарь </h1>\n<h2> Сбор данных: </h2>\n<p> Исходные данные собираются странами, как правило, ежегодно из источников государственной регистрации актов гражданского состояния и статистики естественного движения населения, каждые 3-5 лет из специализированных обзоров, каждые 5-7 лет из обследований населения, каждые 10 лет из переписей населения. </p><h2> Выпуск данных: </h2>\n<p> Следующий раунд расчета оценки коэффициента материнской смертности запланирован для публикации 2022 года. </p><h1> Поставщики данных </h1>\n<p> Поставщиками данных на национальном уровне могут быть статистические управления, специализированные органы санэпиднадзора и Министерство здравоохранения. </p><h1> Составители данных </h1>\n<p> Межучрежденческая группа по оценке материнской смертности (МГОМС), в состав которой входят: ВОЗ, ЮНИСЕФ, ЮНФПА, Группа Всемирного банка и Отдел народонаселения ООН. </p><h2> Обоснование: </h2>\n<p> Все показатели материнской смертности, полученные по результатам раунда оценки 2019 года, включают точечное оценивание и 80-процентный интервал неопределенности (ИН). Данные доступны и могут быть загружены с веб-страницы уровней и тенденций материнской смертности за 2000–2017 годы: <a href=\"http://mmr2017.srhr.org\"> http://mmr2017.srhr.org </a>. При рассмотрении оценок следует учитывать как точечные оценки, так и 80-процентные интервалы неопределенности. </p>\n<p> Например: </p>\n<p> Расчетный глобальный коэффициент материнской смертности в 2017 году составлял 211 (при ИН от 199 до 243)</p>\n<p> Это означает: </p>\n<p> &#x2022; Точечная оценка составляет 211, а 80-процентный интервал неопределенности колеблется от 199 до 243. </p>\n<p> & # x2022; Существует 50% -ная вероятность того, что истинный глобальный коэффициент материнской смертности 2017 года будет выше 211, и 50% -ная вероятность того, что истинное значение будет ниже 211. </p>\n<p> & # x2022; Существует 80-процентная вероятность того, что истинный глобальный коэффициент материнской смертности 2017 года находится между 199 и 243. </p>\n<p> & # x2022; По-прежнему существует 10% -ная вероятность того, что истинный глобальный коэффициент материнской смертности 2017 года будет выше 243, и 10% -ная вероятность того, что истинное значение будет ниже 199.</p>\n<p> Другие точные интерпретации включают: </p>\n<p> &#x2022; Мы на 90% уверены, что истинный глобальный коэффициент материнской смертности 2017 года составляет по крайней мере 199. </p>\n<p> &#x2022; Мы на 90% уверены, что истинный глобальный коэффициент материнской смертности 2017 года составляет 243 или меньше. </p>\n<p> Объем данных, доступных для оценки показателя, и качество этих данных определяют ширину значений интервала неопределенности. По мере повышения доступности и качества данных будет возрастать уверенность в том, что истинное значение показателя будет приближаться к точечной оценке. </p><h2> Комментарии и ограничения: </h2>\n<p> Диапазон значений материнской смертности в популяции по сути является комбинацией двух факторов: </p>\n<p> i. Риск смерти в случае одноплодной беременности или живорождения одного плода. </p>\n<p> ii. Уровень фертильности (то есть количество беременностей или родов у женщин репродуктивного возраста) </p>.\n<p> Коэффициент материнской смертности (КМС) определяется как количество материнских смертей в течение определенного периода времени на 100 000 живорождений за тот же период времени. Он отображает риск материнской смерти по отношению к количеству живорождений и, по сути, отражает фактор (i), приведенный выше. </p>\n<p> Напротив, уровень материнской смертности (УМС) рассчитывается как количество материнских смертей, деленное на человеко-годы, прожитые женщинами репродуктивного возраста. УМС отражает как риск материнской смерти в расчете на одну беременность или на все роды (живорождение или мертворождение), так и уровень фертильности в популяции. Помимо КМС и УМС, можно рассчитать риск материнской смертности в течение жизни взрослой женщины в популяции. Альтернативным показателем материнской смертности является доля смертей среди женщин репродуктивного возраста по акушерским причинам (ДС), рассчитываемая как количество материнских смертей, деленное на общее количество смертей среди женщин в возрасте от 15 до 49 лет.</p>\n<p> <strong> Связанные статистические показатели материнской смертности: </strong> </p>\n<p> Коэффициент материнской смертности (КМС): количество материнских смертей за определенный период времени, приходящееся на 100 000 живорождений за тот же период времени. </p>\n<p> Уровень материнской смертности (УМС): количество материнских смертей, поделенное на человеко-годы, прожитые женщинами репродуктивного возраста. </p>\n<p> Риск материнской смерти в течение жизни взрослой женщины: вероятность 15-летней женщины умереть от акушерских причин. </p>\n<p> Доля смертей среди женщин репродуктивного возраста, вызванных акушерскими причинами (ВМ): количество материнских смертей за определенный период времени, деленное на общее количество смертей среди женщин в возрасте 15 - 49 лет. </p><h1>Методология</h1>\n<h2>Метод расчета:</h2>\n<p> Коэффициент материнской смертности можно рассчитать, разделив зарегистрированную (или оценочную) материнскую смертность на общее количество зарегистрированных (или оцененных) живорождений за тот же период и умножив на 100 000. Для оценки необходимо иметь информацию о состоянии беременности, моменте наступления смерти (во время беременности, родов или в течение 42 дней после окончания беременности) и причине смерти. </p>\n<p> Коэффициент материнской смертности можно рассчитать непосредственно на основе данных, собранных с помощью систем записи актов гражданского состояния, обследований домашних хозяйств или из других источников. Часто возникают проблемы с качеством данных, особенно связанные с занижением и неправильной классификацией материнской смертности. Поэтому данные часто корректируются, чтобы учесть эти проблемы качества данных. Некоторые страны вносят эти корректировки или исправления в рамках специализированных / конфиденциальных запросов или административных мер, включенных в программы мониторинга материнской смертности.</p>\n<p><strong>Байесовская модель оценки материнской смертности (модель BMat): </strong></p>\n<p>Оценка и прогноз показателей материнской смертности производятся с использованием модели BMat. Эта модель предназначена для обеспечения единообразия в подходе к оценке коэффициента материнской смертности для всех стран, но при этом модель остается гибкой, поскольку она основана на тенденциях, определяемых ковариатами, для формирования оценок в странах или стране-периодах с ограниченной информацией, и кроме того модель отражает наблюдаемые тенденции в странах с более длинными временными рядами наблюдений и учитывает различия в стохастических ошибках и ошибках выборки в разных наблюдениях. </p>\n<p> Краткое изложение модели: </p>\n<p><img

Есть также некоторые свидетельства, полученные из социологических исследований, говорящие о том, что женщины с ВИЧ-инфекцией имеют более высокий риск материнской смерти, хотя это может быть компенсировано более низкой фертильностью. Если ВИЧ будет преобладать, будет также больше случайных смертей от ВИЧ среди беременных и находящихся в послеродовом периоде женщин. Таким образом, при оценке материнской смертности в этих странах важно различать случайные смерти от ВИЧ (не материнские смерти) и непрямые материнские смерти, связанные с ВИЧ (материнские смерти, вызванные усугубляющим воздействием беременности на ВИЧ) среди ВИЧ-инфицированных беременные и умерших женщин в послеродовом периоде (т.е. среди всех смертей, связанных с ВИЧ, произошедших во время беременности, родов и послеродового периода).</p>\n<p>Количество связанных с ВИЧ косвенных <strong> <em> </em> </strong> материнских смертей, <em> D <sup> ВИЧ </sup>, </em> оценивается:</p>\n<p><em>D<sup>HIV </sup>= a * E * v * u</em></p>\n<p>где</p>\n<p><em>a*E</em> = общее количество смертей, связанных с ВИЧ, среди всех смертей женщин в возрасте 15 - 49 лет.</p>\n<p><em> v = </em> - доля смертей от ВИЧ среди женщин в возрасте от 15 до 49 лет, произошедших во время беременности. Значение <em> v </em> можно вычислить следующим образом: <em> v & # xA0; </em> = & # xA0; <em> ck GFR / [</em> 1 + <em> c </em> (<em> k- </em> 1) <em> СКФ] </em>, где <strong> </strong> ОКФ - общий коэффициент фертильности, и где <em> c </em> - среднее время воздействия (в годах) риска связанной с беременностью смерти на одно живорождение (для данного анализа установлено значение 1), и где <em> k </em> - относительный риск смерти от СПИДа для беременной по сравнению с небеременной женщиной (что отражает как снижение фертильности ВИЧ-положительных женщин, так и повышенный риск смерти ВИЧ-положительных беременных женщин). Значение k было установлено равным 0,3.</p>\n<p> u = - доля смертей от СПИДа, связанных с беременностью, считается косвенной материнской смертностью. Межучрежденческая группа по оценке материнской смертности / Группа технической поддержки ООН изучила имеющиеся данные исследования смертности от СПИДа среди беременных женщин и рекомендовала использовать <em> u & # xA0; = & # xA0; </em> 0.3.</p>\n<p>Для наблюдаемых долей материнских смертей среди женщин репродуктивного возраста мы предположили, что общее зарегистрированное количество материнских смертей представляет собой комбинацию доли зарегистрированных материнских смертей, не связанных с ВИЧ, и доли зарегистрированных (непрямых) материнских смертей, связанных с ВИЧ, где последняя дается как <em> a * v </em> для наблюдений с определением смерти, связанной с беременностью, и <em> a * v * u </em> для наблюдений с определением материнской смерти.</p><h2> Обработка отсутствующих значений: </h2>\n<ul>\n  <li> <strong> <em> На страновом уровне: </em> </strong> </li>\n  <li> <strong> <em> На региональном и глобальном уровнях: </em> </strong> </li>\n</ul>\n<p> Статистическая модель BMaT используется для оценки материнской смертности при формировании прогноза, основанного на тенденциях, за периоды, когда данных недостаточно, или для стран, у которых данных мало или вообще нет. Модель включает факторы, которые, как известно, связаны с материнской смертностью, в качестве прогностического фактора ковариантов (валовой внутренний продукт (ВВП), общий коэффициент фертильности (ОКФ) и доля деторождений при квалифицированном родовспоможении (ДКР)). </p><h2> Региональные агрегаты: </h2>\n<p>Коэффициент материнской смертности можно рассчитать, разделив зарегистрированную (или оценочную) материнскую смертность на общее количество зарегистрированных (или оцененных) живорождений за тот же период и умножив на 100 000. Для оценки необходимо иметь информацию о состоянии беременности, времени наступления смерти (во время беременности, родов или в течение 42 дней после окончания беременности) и причине смерти. </p>\n<p> Коэффициент материнской смертности можно рассчитать непосредственно на основе данных, собираемых с помощью системы записи актов гражданского состояния, обследований домашних хозяйств или из других источников. Часто возникают проблемы с качеством данных, особенно связанные с их занижением и неправильной классификацией материнской смертности. Поэтому данные часто корректируются, чтобы учесть эти проблемы с качеством. </p>\n<p> Поскольку материнская смертность является относительно редким явлением, то необходимы большие размеры выборки в том случае, если для выявления недавних (например, прошлогодних) случаев материнской смертности в домашнем хозяйстве используется метод обследования домашних хозяйств. Этот метод по-прежнему может приводить к оценкам с большими доверительными интервалами, что ограничивает их полезность для сравнений между странами или в зависимости от времени. </p>\n<p> Для уменьшения требований к размеру выборки, метод сестринства, используемый в Обследовании демографических характеристик и состояния здоровья и Кластерном исследовании по многим показателям, применяется также для расчета материнской смертности, при котором респондентам задаются вопросы о выживаемости сестер. Следует отметить, что метод сестринства показывает смертность, связанную с беременностью: независимо от причины смерти, все случаи смерти, произошедшие во время беременности, родов или в течение шести недель после окончания беременности, включаются в числитель коэффициента материнской смертности. </p>\n<p> Переписи населения, в которые также включали вопросы о материнской смертности, давали результаты с переменным успехом. </p>\n<p> Исследования смертности в репродуктивном возрасте ((ИСРВ) - это специальное исследование, в котором используются различные источники, в зависимости от контекста, для выявления материнской смертности; ни один источник не выявляет все случаи смерти. Интервью с членами домохозяйства и поставщиками медицинских услуг, а также проверка записей учреждения используются для причисления смертей к материнским или вызванным иными причинами. При правильном применении этот подход обеспечивает достаточно полную оценку материнской смертности (при отсутствии надежных систем регулярной регистрации) и может обеспечить субнациональные коэффициенты материнской смертности. Однако неадекватная идентификация всех случаев смерти женщин репродуктивного возраста приводит к недооценке уровней материнской смертности. Этот подход может быть сложным, трудоемким и дорогостоящим в реализации, особенно в больших масштабах. Количество живорождений, используемое в расчетах, может быть неточным, особенно в условиях, когда большинство женщин рожают дома. </p>\n<p> ВОЗ, ЮНИСЕФ, ЮНФПА, Группа Всемирного банка и Отдел народонаселения ООН разработали метод корректировки существующих данных с тем, чтобы учесть эти проблемы качества данных и обеспечить сопоставимость данных из различных источников. Этот метод включает оценку полноты данных и, при необходимости, поправку на неполноту и неправильную классификацию смертей, а также разработку оценок с помощью статистического моделирования для стран, не имеющих надежных данных на национальном уровне. </p>\n<p> Данные по материнской смертности и другим соответствующим переменным получаются из баз данных, которые ведут ВОЗ, Отдел народонаселения ООН, ЮНИСЕФ и Группа Всемирного банка. Данные, доступные по странам, различаются по источникам и методам. Учитывая вариабельность источников данных, для каждого источника данных используются разные методы с тем, чтобы получить сопоставимые страновые оценки, позволяющие агрегировать данные на региональном и глобальном уровнях. </p>\n<p> В настоящее время только около трети всех стран / территорий имеют надежные данные и не нуждаются в дополнительных оценках. Примерно для половины стран, включенных в процесс оценки, представленные странами оценки материнской смертности скорректированы для целей сопоставимости методологий. По остальным странам / территориям, у которых нет соответствующих данных по материнской смертности, для прогнозирования уровней материнской смертности используется статистическая модель. Однако расчетные точечные оценки, произведенные с помощью этой методологии, могут не отражать истинных уровней материнской смертности. Рекомендуется рассматривать оценки вместе с указанными границами неопределенности, в рамках которых, как известно, находятся истинные уровни.</p>\n<p> Подробная информация о корректировках и формулах опубликована / доступна здесь: </p>\n<p> (1) Peterson E, Chou D, Gemmill A, Moller AB, Say L, Alkema L.

Из 185 стран и территорий 177 имеют национально репрезентативные данные. </p>\n<h2> Дезагрегирование: </h2>\n<p> Текущие оценки коэффициента материнской смертности представлены на страновом, региональном и глобальном уровнях. Оценки на региональном уровне представлены по слоям доходов в соответствии с классификацией Всемирного банка, а также по региональным группировкам ЮНИСЕФ и ЮНФПА. </p><h2> Источники расхождений: </h2>\n<p> Коэффициент материнской смертности (КМС) определяется как количество материнских смертей, поделенное на количество живорождений. Однако, чтобы учесть потенциальную неполноту регистрации смертей в различных источниках данных, Межучрежденческая группа по оценке материнской смертности (МГОМС) сначала вычисляет долю смертей по материнским причинам из исходных источников данных (называемую долей материнских смертей или ДС), а затем применяет эту долю при оценках ВОЗ общего числа смертей среди женщин репродуктивного возраста, чтобы получить оценку количества материнских смертей. </p>\n<p> Другими словами, следующая доля сначала вычисляется на основе источников страновых данных: </p>\n<p> ДС = Количество материнских смертей в возрасте 15–49 лет / Все случаи смерти женщин в возрасте 15–49 лет </p>\n<p>, а затем ДС используется для вычисления КМС следующим образом: </p>\n<p> КМС = ДС&#xD7; (Все случаи смерти женщин в возрасте 15–49 лет / Количество живорождений) </p>\n<p>, где оценка всех смертей в возрасте 15-49 лет во втором уравнении получена из таблиц смертности ВОЗ, а количество живорождений - из публикации \"Мировые демографические перспективы\" за 2019 год. </p>\n<p> Исходя из этого, несколько причин, по которым оценки Межучрежденческой группы по оценке материнской смертности (МГОМС) могут отличаться от данных национальной статистики, заключаются в следующем: </p>\n<p> 1. Данные системы регистрации актов гражданского состояния и статистики естественного движения населения не всегда являются полными (т.е. они не всегда фиксируют 100% всех случаев смерти), и их полнота может меняться со временем. Подход к оценке, применяемый Межучрежденческой группой по оценке материнской смертности (МГОМС), пытается исправить это положение, используя вышеупомянутый подход, который на первом этапе включает в себя вычисление ДС.</p>\n<p> 2. Межучрежденческая группа по оценке материнской смертности (МГОМС) часто применяет поправочные коэффициенты к ДС, рассчитанным на основе исходных данных, для учета проблем оценки (например, того, как страна определила материнскую смертность, неправильную классификацию или неполноту). </p>\n<p> 3. МГОМС использует стандартизированные ряды данных по живорождениям из Отдела народонаселения ООН, опубликованные в издании \"Мировые демографические перспективы\" за 2019 год, в знаменателе уравнения КМС (коэффициента материнской смертности). Чтобы предоставлять лучшую информацию для издания \"Мировые демографические перспективы\", страны должны обсуждать расхождения непосредственно с Отделом народонаселения ООН. Контактный адрес: Population@un.org; этот адрес электронной почты регулярно проверяется, и сообщения рассылаются соответствующим аналитикам по каждой стране или тематике. </p>\n<p> 4. С точки зрения статистики, материнская смертность является относительно редким событием, что может приводить к искажению тенденций в данных с течением времени. Поскольку целью оценок МГОМС является отслеживание долгосрочного прогресса в снижении материнской смертности, процесс оценки включает некоторое сглаживание для создания кривой, которая лучше отражает изменения, лежащие в основе риска.</p><h1> Ссылки </h1>\n<h2> URL: </h2>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/maternal-mortality-2000-2017/en/\"> https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/maternal-mortality-2000-2017/en/ </a> </p>\n<h2> Ссылки: </h2>\n<p> (1) Всемирная организация здравоохранения (ВОЗ), Детский фонд Организации Объединенных Наций (ЮНИСЕФ), Фонд Организации Объединенных Наций в области народонаселения (ЮНФПА), Группа Всемирного банка, Отдел народонаселения Организации Объединенных Наций.
