	<data>&lt;p&gt;NSOs typically lead survey efforts for data collection at the country level. Within the World Bank, the Global Poverty Working Group (GPWG) oversees the collection, validation of income and consumption survey data used in estimation. GPWG archives the datasets obtained from NSOs and harmonizes them, applying common methodologies to ensure comparability, before estimation.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
