	<data>&lt;p&gt;Within the World Bank, the Global Poverty Working Group (GPWG) is in charge of the collection, validation of income and consumption survey data used in estimation. GPWG archives the datasets obtained from NSOs and then harmonizes them, applying common methodologies. The objective of the GPWG is to ensure that poverty and inequality data generated, curated, and disseminated by the World Bank are up to date, meet high-quality standards, and are well documented and consistent across dissemination channels. Members of GPWG generate and update the estimates for the proportion of population below the international poverty line using raw data typically provided by country governments. World Bank country staff works in close collaboration with national statistical authorities on the data collection and dissemination process.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
