	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 10-2-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The indicator is measured using the national distribution per capita measure of consumption or income, as derived from surveys. The indicator is calculated by estimating the share (in percent) of the population living on less than 50% of median of the national distribution of income or consumption. The median is estimate from the same distribution as the indicator is estimated from, thus the 50% of median threshold will vary over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per capita income or consumption is estimated using total household income or consumption divided by the total household size.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
