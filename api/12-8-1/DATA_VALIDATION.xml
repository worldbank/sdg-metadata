			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Responses will be reviewed by UNESCO for consistency and credibility and, if necessary, queries will be raised with national respondents. Where feasible, reference will be made to national documents and links supplied by respondents and to available alternative sources of information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any proposed changes in response values in the questionnaire as the result of quality assurance procedures will be communicated and verified with countries by UNESCO. Final results will be shared with countries before publication by UNESCO with the national data providers and with national SDG indicator focal points where they exist.&lt;/p&gt;
