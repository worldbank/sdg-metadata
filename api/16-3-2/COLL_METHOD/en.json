The UN-CTS data collection is largely based on the network of national Focal Points, which are institutions/officials appointed by countries and having the technical capacity and role to produce data on crime and criminal justice (around 130 appointed Focal Points as of 2016). In addition, these data are supplemented for countries with missing values with official data collected by the Institute for Criminal Policy Research (World Prison Brief), which collects data directly from national prison administrations or from the websites of Ministries of Justice or other official agencies. For future SDG reporting data will be sent to countries for consultation prior to publication.</p>"}
