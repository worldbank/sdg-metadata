	<data>&lt;p&gt;Protected area data are compiled by ministries of environment and other ministries responsible for the designation and maintenance of protected areas. Protected Areas data for sites designated under the Ramsar Convention and the UNESCO World Heritage Convention are collected through the relevant convention international secretariats. Protected area data are aggregated globally into the WDPA by UNEP-WCMC, according to the mandate for production of the United Nations List of Protected Areas (Deguignet et al. 2014). They are disseminated through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.protectedplanet.net/&quot;&gt;Protected Planet&lt;/a&gt;, which is jointly managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC 2016).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs) are collated in the WDOECM. This database can be regarded as a sister database to the WDPA as it is also hosted on Protected Planet. Furthermore, the databases share many of the same fields and have an almost identical workflow; differing only in what they list. OECMs are a quickly evolving area of work, as such for the latest information on OECMs and the WDOECM please contact UNEP-WCMC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KBAs are identified at national scales through multi-stakeholder processes, following standard criteria and thresholds. KBAs data are aggregated into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/&quot;&gt;World Database on &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/&quot;&gt;KBAs&lt;/a&gt;, managed by BirdLife International. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
