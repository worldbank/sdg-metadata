	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 14-5-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National processes provide the data that are incorporated into the World Database on Protected Areas, the World Database on Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures, and the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, so there are very few discrepancies between national indicators and the global one. One minor source of difference is that the World Database on Protected Areas incorporates internationally-designated protected areas (e.g., UNESCO World Heritage sites, Ramsar sites, etc), a few of which are not considered by their sovereign nations to be protected areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that because countries do not submit comprehensive data on degazetted protected areas to the WDPA, earlier values of the indictor may marginally underestimate coverage. Furthermore, there is also a lag between the point at which a protected area is designated on the ground and the point at which it is reported to the WDPA. As such, current or recent coverage may also be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
