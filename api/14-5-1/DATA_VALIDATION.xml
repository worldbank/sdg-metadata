			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Protected Areas and OECMs are validated through dialogue with the governing authority, who signs a data contributor agreement that these sites are, to the best of their knowledge, an accurate depiction of the sites in question. Over time the data for sites may improve or other aspects of the sites may change, as and when this occurs a further data sharing agreement is required by the site&amp;#x2019;s governing authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposed Key Biodiversity Areas undergo detailed checking by Regional Focal Points, formal Review of KBA Proposals by independent Reviewers, and validation of Nominated Key Biodiversity Areas by the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat. For further information, see the Guidance on Proposing, Reviewing, Nominating and Confirming KBAs available in KBA Secretariat (2019) at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/assets/35687f50ac0bcad155ab17447b48885a&quot;&gt;http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/assets/35687f50ac0bcad155ab17447b48885a&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the indicators of protected area coverage of Key Biodiversity Areas are updated each year, the updated indicators (and underlying numbers of protected areas, Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures, and Key Biodiversity Areas) are made available for review by countries prior to submission to the SDG Indicators Database. This is achieved through updating the country profiles in the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles&quot;&gt;https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles&lt;/a&gt;) and circulating these for consultation and review to CBD National Focal Points, SDG National Statistical Office Focal Points, and IUCN State Members.&lt;/p&gt;
