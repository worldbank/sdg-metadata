			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Once data is received from member states, UN-Habitat uses a checklist specific to each indicator to assess a) whether the data production process followed the metadata provisions, and b) confirm the accuracy of the data sources used for the indicator computation. In addition, the received data is also checked for other qualities such as reporting period and consistency with other previously reported trends, which ensures reliable regional estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
