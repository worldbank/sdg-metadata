	<message>The QUALITY_ASSURE field for indicator 11-a-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;UN-Habitat&amp;#x2019;s work in the areas of national and regional development planning has developed a strong foundation of evidence that can be adapted to monitor this target and indicator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monitoring of the indicator will also benefit from various ongoing initiatives of policy reviews undertaken by UN-Habitat for its country assistance, or the OECD in its Urban Policy Review series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, UN-Habitat and the OECD have jointly published the 2018 &lt;em&gt;Global State of National Urban Policy Report,&lt;/em&gt; which identifies 150 NUPs worldwide, and analyses them according to their development phase, thematic components and institutional arrangement, and aggregates them into regional and global analyses. The second edition of the Global Report will be published in 2020 and future editions will align more closely with the terms of indicator 11.a.1 and will consistently assess the three qualifiers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UN-Habitat also conducted in-depth analyses of the NUP trends and national case studies in global regions through National Urban Policy Reports in Arab States, Asia and the Pacific, Europe and North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Sub-Saharan Africa. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
