			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;At the international level, data on refugee populations are routinely collected by UNHCR through the biannual Population Statistic Review (PSR) data collection. Focal points in each UNHCR operation submit data to the Statistics and Demographics Section in the Global Data Service that performs consistency checks. In most cases these focal points obtain data either from the UNHCR registration database (in countries where UNHCR performs registration directly), or from national institutions responsible for data production in the area of asylum and refugee matters (National Statistical Offices, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Justice, Administrative Tribunals). When a country does not report refugee figures to UNHCR, estimations based on positive decisions on asylum applications from previous years are used. Once consolidated, data are shared to countries to check their accuracy. Data for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) monitoring will also be sent to countries for consultation before publication. &lt;/p&gt;
