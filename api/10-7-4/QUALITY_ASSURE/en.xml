	<data>&lt;p&gt;A number of validation rules are included in the global database, so that that data containing errors will not be accepted. All data submitted by countries are additionally verified for consistency by the UNHCR Statistics and Demographics Section. This includes checks with previous years&amp;#x2019; data, and among data reported by different countries. When inconsistencies exist, for instance when refugee returns reported by a country differ from the arrivals reported by another, the difference is taken back to the countries until the difference is resolved. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
