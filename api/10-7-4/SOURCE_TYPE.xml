			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Two main sources exist at country level: a) administrative asylum systems; b) direct refugee registration databases. In cases where UNHCR performs refugee registration directly, operations provide data which is available with a highest degree of disaggregation. In cases where refugees go through a Refugee Status Determination (RSD) administrative procedure, data is collected by Governments in the biannual Population Statistics Review exercise facilitated by focal points in UNHCR country offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Population data are derived from annual estimates produced by the UN Population Division (2022 Revision of World Population Prospects, Total Population, both sexes). Estimates until 2020 and medium fertility variant projection for years thereafter. &lt;/p&gt;
