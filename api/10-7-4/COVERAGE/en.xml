Time series data on refugees suitable for monitoring are available for 192 countries. Approximately 83 percent of the refugee population have data which can be disaggregated by sex and 76 percent which can be disaggregated by age. The age and sex disaggregation for the remainder of the population is estimated with statistical methods. &lt;/p&gt;
