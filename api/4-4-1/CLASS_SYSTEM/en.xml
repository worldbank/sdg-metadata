	<data>&lt;p&gt;Activities are classified according to agreement at the Expert Group meeting on ICT Household Indicators (EGH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, for countries that collect this data through an official survey, and if data allow breakdown and disaggregation, the indicator can be broken down by region (urban/rural), by sex, by age group, by educational level (ISCED), by labour force status (ILO), and by occupation (ISCO). ITU collects data for all of these breakdowns from countries.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
