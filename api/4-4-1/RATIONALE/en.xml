	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 4-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;ICT skills determine the effective use of information and communication technology, so this indicator may therefore assist in making the link between ICT usage and impact. The lack of such skills continues to be one of the key barriers keeping people from fully benefitting from the potential of information and communication technologies. These data may be used to inform targeted policies to improve ICT skills, and thus contribute to an inclusive information society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a core indicator of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development&amp;apos;s Core List of Indicators, which has been endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission (in 2014).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
