	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 12-7-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data will be made available for all member states which have sustainable public procurement policies and action plans, as defined by the indicator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reporting on this indicator will be biennial, starting from 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Administrative level of the public procurement: national, provincial, or local. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Information has been received at those three levels in the first data collection exercise, but only in rare occasions. Data can be provided &lt;u&gt;separately&lt;/u&gt; by administrative level (whenever data was received from subnational governments) for some provincial or local governments only.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
