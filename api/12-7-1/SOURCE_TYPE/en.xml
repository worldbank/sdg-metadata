	<message>The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 12-7-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Based on the contact list of focal points identified in the drafting of the 2017 SPP country factsheets and of the One Planet 10-year framework of programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production patterns, representatives from more than &lt;strong&gt;70 countries&lt;/strong&gt; were contacted from September to November 2020&lt;strong&gt;, to identify relevant focal points for SDG 12.7.1 data collection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this process, &lt;strong&gt;55+ national governments&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;8 subnational governments&lt;/strong&gt; (reporting independently from their national government) &lt;strong&gt;set a specific team or designated a relevant focal point to report on SDG 12.7.1 indicator&lt;/strong&gt;, most often originating either from National Procurement Agencies, Treasury Boards (Ministries of Finance), Ministries of Environment. In rarer cases, from the Focal point works for the Statistical Departments in charge of reporting on SDGs at national level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SDG 12.7.1 survey was sent out to those focal points and, as a result, submissions were received from 40 national/federal governments (some of which included subnational data as well from provinces or municipalities). 8 subnational governments also reported independently on their SPP policy and action plan implementation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
