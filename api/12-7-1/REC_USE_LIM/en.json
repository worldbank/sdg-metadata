{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 12-7-1, translated into en","data":"<p>The index aims to measure not only SPP but also GPP (Green Public Procurement) and SRPP (Socially Responsible Public Procurement). However, <strong>SPP, GPP and SRPP may be addressed in very different ways</strong> depending on the country. They may appear <strong>as a component of overarching policies</strong> such as Sustainable Development Strategies, Green Economy Roadmaps, etc. <strong>They may also be addressed directly with the adoption of a SPP action plan or policy, or through regulatory means</strong>, such as specific provisions in the Public Procurement legal framework.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The main issues faced during the development of this indicator are:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Data on the proportion of sustainable public procurement are not available because there is no agreement on which products are green or sustainable and because data are very often not classified in terms of volumes and value of purchased products. </li>\n  <li>Another limitation is related to the existence of multiple layers and components of public procurement: central government, provinces in federal countries, municipal level, public enterprises, hospitals, defence, etc. Procurement data from these different sectors are very often not aggregated.</li>\n  <li>In addition, contracts below a certain threshold are not monitored.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a result, and in line with the comment in the rationale section, it was decided to focus on process sub-indicators which will measure the means and efforts countries are investing in the implementation of their SPP plans, policies and programmes.</p>"}
