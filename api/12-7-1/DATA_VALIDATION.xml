			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Firstly, &lt;strong&gt;Excel-based self-assessment forms&lt;/strong&gt;, along with &lt;strong&gt;PDF Guidance, and Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/strong&gt; are shared with reporting government focal points to provide relevant instructions on how to supply the required information and data. For each answer provided, it is required to provide relevant evidence, and precise references to that evidence, supporting the selected pre-set answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, each report is verified to check whether relevant evidence is provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed feedback specific to each question is sent to the relevant focal points to request for clarifications or further details and evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, further to those bilateral exchanges, the additional information or evidence provided are further checked. &lt;strong&gt;When it appears that the provided details/evidence do not sufficiently support the selected answer, those answers are not considered in the final evaluation&lt;/strong&gt;. Final information and reports provided are deemed compliant or not compliant, leading to the calculation and validation of the final SPP score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The calculation of this final score provides a basis for the classification of governments into five different categories reflecting the level of implementation of SPP, as described in section &lt;em&gt;4.c. Method of computation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
