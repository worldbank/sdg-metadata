In some cases a country&#x2019;s action plan may focus on a single aspect of sustainability, being either environmental (e.g. &#x201C;Green&#x201D; public procurement action plan), social (e.g. reference to human rights, fair trade, focus on employment of minorities, etc.), or economic (e.g. promotion of SMEs&#x2019; participation in tenders, focus on employment of minorities, etc.). </p>\n<p><em>Best Value for Money:</em> can be defined as the &#x201C;optimum combination of whole-life cost and quality to meet the end-user&apos;s requirements&quot;.</p>\n<p><em>Life-cycle costing (LCC):</em> is used to evaluate costs which may not be reflected in the purchase price of a product, work or service, and which will be incurred during their lifetime.</p>\n<p><em>MEAT:</em> The Most Economically Advantageous Tender criterion enables the contracting authority to take account of criteria that reflect qualitative, technical and sustainable aspects of the tender submission as well as price when reaching an award decision.</p>\n<p>More reference about the above and their contextualization can be found in the attached <a href=\"https://wedocs.unep.org/handle/20.500.11822/37332\"><em>SPP Index Methodology</em></a>.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">1</sup><p> <a href=\"#footnote-ref-2\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>"}
