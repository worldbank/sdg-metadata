	<message>The DOC_METHOD field for indicator 12-7-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;To facilitate 2020 data collection exercise and ensure the widest possible participation, the following documents were made available to focal points and developed &lt;u&gt;in three languages&lt;/u&gt; (English, Spanish and French):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2020 Excel-based calculation tool used for the collection of inputs;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2020 Reporting Instructions;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2020 Frequently Asked Questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four explanatory webinars were also held in October 2020 in these three languages (two webinars in English, one in French, one in Spanish) to introduce the Calculation methodology and reporting tools, and provide the necessary guidance on how to provide the required data. Those webinars were attended by a total of 79 government representatives from 43 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public procurement systems differing significantly, and the responsibility of SPP/GPP/SRPP policy development or implementation belonging to different ministries or institutions in each country, it is not however in UNEP&amp;#x2019;s capacity to provide more detailed assistance to national focal points on data collection specific to each sub-indicator, as those data may originate either from Public Procurement Agencies, Treasury Boards (Ministry of Finance), or Ministries of Environment.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
