	<data>&lt;p&gt;In accordance with the World Bank&amp;#x2019;s Operational Policy 14.10 (which includes IBRD and IDA General Conditions) external debt reporting is required to fulfil the World Bank&amp;#x2019;s needs for reliable and timely external debt information to (a) assess a borrowing country&amp;apos;s foreign debt situation, creditworthiness, and economic management; and (b) conduct its country economic work and assess regional and global indebtedness and debt servicing problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;External borrowing of reporting countries is performed through the Debtor Reporting System (DRS), which was established in 1951 and captures detailed information at loan level by using standardized set of forms.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
