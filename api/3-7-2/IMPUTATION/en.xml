	<data>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; At country level&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no attempt to provide estimates for individual countries or areas when country or area data are not available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; At regional and global levels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regional or global aggregates of the adolescent birth rate for the age group 15-19 years are from the latest revision of World Population Prospects produced by the Population Division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cases when data are missing or assessed as unreliable, estimates for individual countries or areas are generated either through expert-based opinion reviewing and weighting each observation analytically, or, in more recent years, using automated statistical methods, or by using a bias- adjusted data model to control for systematic biases between different types of data. See United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2019). World Population Prospects 2019: Methodology of the United Nations population estimates and projections (ST/ESA/SER.A/425), available at: &lt;a href=&quot;https://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2019_Methodology.pdf&quot;&gt;https://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2019_Methodology.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</data>
