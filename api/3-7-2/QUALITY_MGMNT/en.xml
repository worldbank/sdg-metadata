	<data>&lt;p&gt;The Population Division maintains an online database of empirical demographic data and selected tabulations (including fertility rates) from different sources including estimates produced by National Statistical Offices and regional statistical units. Data since the last round of SDG reporting are continuously updated from various sources: DemoData: Data Browser (online database of empirical demographic data and selected tabulations)&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://popdiv.dfs.un.org/demodata/web/&amp;quot; \l &amp;quot;!#%2Fhome&quot;&gt;https://popdiv.dfs.un.org/demodata/web/#!#%2Fhome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With each revision of World Population Prospects (WPP), the Population Division carries out a re-estimation of historical demographic trends for countries and territories of the world. These demographic estimates are based on the most recently available data sources, such as censuses, demographic surveys, registries of vital events, population registers and various other sources. Newly available demographic data and information are subjected to quality analyses and evaluated by examining the consistency in the patterns, levels and trends of the data across countries and regions. The description of the guidelines for managing the quality of the data and process is available at: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/unpd-egm-fer-2020-10-backgroundpaper_newtitle_final_oct9.pdf&quot;&gt;https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/unpd-egm-fer-2020-10-backgroundpaper_newtitle_final_oct9.pdf&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2022_Methodology.pdf&quot;&gt;https://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2022_Methodology.pdf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</data>
