	<data>&lt;p&gt;Discrepancies between estimates obtained from different national data are common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For civil registration, rates are subject to limitations which depend on the completeness of birth registration, the treatment of infants born alive but die before registration or within the first 24 hours of life, the quality of the reported information relating to age of the mother, and the inclusion of births from previous periods. The population estimates may suffer from limitations connected to age misreporting and coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For survey and census data, both the numerator and denominator come from the same population. The main limitations concern age misreporting, the omission of births, misreporting the date of birth of the child, and, in the case of surveys, sampling size and variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With respect to estimates of the adolescent birth rate among females aged 10-14 years, comparative evidence suggests that a very small proportion of births in this age group occur to females below age 12. Other evidence based on retrospective birth history data from surveys indicates that women aged 15-19 years are less likely to report first births before age 15 than women from the same birth cohort when asked five years later at ages 20&amp;#x2013;24 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adolescent birth rate is commonly reported as the age-specific fertility rate for ages 15-19 years in the context of calculation of total fertility estimates. It has also been called adolescent fertility rate. A related measure is the proportion of adolescent fertility measured as the percentage of total fertility contributed by women aged 15-19.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
