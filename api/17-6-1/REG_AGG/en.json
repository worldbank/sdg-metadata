Hot-deck imputation uses data from countries with &#x201C;similar&#x201D; characteristics, such as GNI per capita and geographic location. In cases when it is not possible to find an adequate imputation based on similar cases, regression models based on a set of countries with relatively similar characteristics are applied.</p>\n<p>Once the country-level percentages are available for all countries, the regional and global aggregates are calculated by summing the country-level data. The aggregate percentages were calculated by dividing the regional totals by the population of respective groups.</p>\n<p>Not calculated for the speed breakdowns.</p>"}
