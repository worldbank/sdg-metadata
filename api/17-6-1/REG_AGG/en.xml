	<message>The REG_AGG field for indicator 17-6-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Missing country-level data are first estimated using various techniques, such as hot-deck imputation, regression models and time series forecast. Hot-deck imputation uses data from countries with &amp;#x201C;similar&amp;#x201D; characteristics, such as GNI per capita and geographic location. In cases when it is not possible to find an adequate imputation based on similar cases, regression models based on a set of countries with relatively similar characteristics are applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the country-level percentages are available for all countries, the regional and global aggregates are calculated by summing the country-level data. The aggregate percentages were calculated by dividing the regional totals by the population of respective groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not calculated for the speed breakdowns.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
