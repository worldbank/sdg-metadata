			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Data will be compiled from administrative data produced by OHCHR, ILO, UNESCO and other UN agencies or entities in accordance with their respective mandates and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, with the support of OHCHR, the various Special Procedures of the UN Human Rights Council undertake country visits and act on individual cases by sending communications to States and occasionally, to non-State actors, in which they bring alleged violations or abuses to their attention for action, among other functions. Special Procedures report annually to the Human Rights Council and the majority of the mandate-holders also report to the General Assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Section 40 of the Manual of Operations of Special Procedures, a decision to take action on a case or situation rests on the discretion of the mandate-holder. That discretion should be exercised in light of the mandate entrusted to him or her as well as criteria generally relating to the reliability of the source; the credibility of information received; the details provid ed; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the scope of the mandate. Every effort is made to determine the probable validity of alleged incidents and the reliability of the source before the special rapporteur makes contact with the Government of the State where the alleged abuse is thought to have occurred. Contact is usually conducted through an &amp;#x201C;urgent appeal&amp;#x201D; or &amp;#x201C;allegation&amp;#x201D; letter addressed to the State&amp;#x2019;s diplomatic mission with the United Nations in Geneva for transmission to capitals. These communications are used to ask the Government to take all appropriate action to investigate and address the alleged events and to communicate the results of its investigation and actions to the Special Rapporteur. Communications as well as State replies are kept confidential until the end of the reporting period. The mandate-holder then reports these cases to the Human Rights Council or the General Assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding UNESCO&amp;#x2019;s statistics on the killings of journalists, UNESCO&amp;#x2019;s data on the killings of journalists corresponds to all of the cases of journalists&amp;#x2019; killings that have been condemned by the UNESCO Director-General. These cases are identified based on reports from multiple sources, including from international, regional and local monitoring groups; UNESCO field offices; UNESCO Permanent Delegations; and other UN bodies. This follows the methodology requested by the IPDC Council through the 2012 IPDC Decision on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impunity, which states that the report should be the result of &amp;#x201C;analysis and comparison o f information from a broad and diverse range of sources for the sake of ensuring objectivity, including updated information provided by the relevant Member States on a voluntary basis on the killing of journalists, and non-responses, and be made widely available&amp;#x201D;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As concerns the status of judicial enquiries into the killings of journalists, UNESCO&amp;#x2019;s data is based solely on information provided by the Member States in which ki llings of journalists condemned by UNESCO&amp;#x2019;s Director-General have occurred. Each year, UNESCO sends out a letter to the Permanent Delegations of these Member States requesting them for an official update on the judicial follow-up to the cases of killed journalists. It is the Permanent Delegation&amp;#x2019;s responsibility to transfer the letter to the competent authorities at national level. On the basis of the information provided, UNESCO prepares the Director-General&amp;#x2019;s Report on the Safety of Journalists or the World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Report, depending on the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a large extent, these procedures are typical of monitoring mechanisms under international law. OHCHR, UNESCO, ILO and other agencies that are responsible for these mechanisms take particular care to integrate in these standard operating procedures the requirement of consultation with the Member States concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, ILO is able to verify reported violations and abuses committed against trade unionists using data from its stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of these processes, administrative data on violence against journalists, trade unionists and other human rights defenders are generated by international organizations. OHCHR will compile and integrate the data using a common data management tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, National Human Rights Institutions, National Statistical Offices, other government agencies as well as civil society organizations and networks will play an important role in the collection of data. NHRIs, on the basis of their own mandate, are able to investigate cases of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;violations and abuses brought to their attention. Several NHRIs have also institutionalized the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;provision of legal advice and other forms of support to victims of abuses who wish to access international mechanisms. NSOs, on the other hand, can complement this work by ensuring the implementation of internationally-accepted statistical standards, including on data exchange and dissemination for this indicator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OHCHR, UNESCO and ILO will work jointly with national stakeholders to build capacity, harmonize data collection procedures and produce globally comparable results. &lt;/p&gt;
