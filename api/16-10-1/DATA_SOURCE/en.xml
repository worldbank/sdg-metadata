&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global data on violence against journalists, trade unionists and other human rights defenders are collected by OHCHR, UNESCO and ILO using a common template and integrated into a single dataset, eliminating risks of double-counting. Complementary national data will be provided to OHCHR, UNESCO and ILO, as relevant, by member states, through their national human rights institutions, in collaboration with NSOs. At country level, the primary sources will be generally NHRIs working with civil society organizations and networks.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
