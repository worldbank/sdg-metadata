In 2001, the WHO Executive Board endorsed a resolution (EB. 107.R8) seeking to &#x201C;establish a technical consultation process bringing together personnel and perspectives from Member States in different WHO regions&#x201D;. A key objective of this consultation process is &#x201C;to ensure that each Member State is consulted on the best data to be used&#x201D;. Since the process is an integral step in the overall estimation strategy, it is described here in brief.</p>\n<p>The country consultation process entails an exchange between WHO and technical focal person(s) in each country. It is carried out prior to the publication of estimates. During the consultation period, WHO invites focal person(s) to review input data sources, methods for estimation and the preliminary estimates. Focal person(s) are encouraged to submit additional data that may not have been taken into account in the preliminary estimates.</p>"}
