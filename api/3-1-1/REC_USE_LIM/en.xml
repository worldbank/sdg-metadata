	<data>&lt;p&gt;The extent of maternal mortality in a population is essentially the combination of two factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The risk of death in a single pregnancy or a single live birth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The fertility level (i.e. the number of pregnancies or births that are experienced by women of reproductive age).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100 000 live births during the same time period. It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live births and essentially captures (i) above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the maternal mortality rate (MMRate) is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by person-years lived by women of reproductive age. The MMRate captures both the risk of maternal death per pregnancy or per total birth (live birth or stillbirth), and the level of fertility in the population. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the MMR and the MMRate, it is possible to calculate the adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality for women in the population. An alternative measure of maternal mortality, the proportion of deaths among women of reproductive age that are due to maternal causes (PM), is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by the total deaths among women aged 15&amp;#x2013;49 years.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
