	<data>&lt;p&gt;Maternal deaths are classified according to the &lt;em&gt;International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems&lt;/em&gt; (ICD) definition. The specific codes used under ICD-10 (the 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; revision of the ICD) to define a maternal death are: O00-O96; O98, O99 and A34.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICD-11 (the 11th revision of the ICD) was adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2019 and comes into effect on 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; January 2022. Further information is available at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/&quot;&gt;www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/&lt;/a&gt; The coding rules related to maternal mortality are being edited to fully match the new structure of ICD-11, but without changing the resulting statistics. The ICD-11 rules can be accessed in the reference guide of ICD-11, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://icd.who.int&quot;&gt;https://icd.who.int&lt;/a&gt; . Forthcoming releases from 2022 onwards will transition to use ICD-11 coding. Care has been taken to ensure that the definition of maternal death used for international comparison of mortality statistics remains stable over time, but the word &amp;#x201C;unintentional&amp;#x201D; has been used in the ICD-11 definition in place of the word &amp;#x201C;accidental&amp;#x201D; which was previously used, in ICD-10.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
