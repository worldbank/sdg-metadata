The specific codes used under ICD-10 (the 10<sup>th</sup> revision of the ICD) to define a maternal death are: O00-O96; O98, O99 and A34.</p>\n<p>ICD-11 (the 11th revision of the ICD) was adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2019 and comes into effect on 1<sup>st</sup> January 2022. Further information is available at: <a href=\"http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/\">www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/</a> The coding rules related to maternal mortality are being edited to fully match the new structure of ICD-11, but without changing the resulting statistics. The ICD-11 rules can be accessed in the reference guide of ICD-11, at <a href=\"https://icd.who.int\">https://icd.who.int</a> . Forthcoming releases from 2022 onwards will transition to use ICD-11 coding. Care has been taken to ensure that the definition of maternal death used for international comparison of mortality statistics remains stable over time, but the word &#x201C;unintentional&#x201D; has been used in the ICD-11 definition in place of the word &#x201C;accidental&#x201D; which was previously used, in ICD-10.</p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
