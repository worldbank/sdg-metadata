{"status":"success","message":"The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 3-1-1, translated into en","data":"<p>The United Nations Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group (UN MMEIG) &#x2013; comprising WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, the World Bank Group and the United Nations Population Division (UNPD) of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (MMEIG) maintains an input database consisting of maternal mortality data from civil registration, population-based surveys, surveillance systems, censuses, and other specialized studies/surveys. This database is used to calculate the proportion of maternal deaths (PM) among women of reproductive age (WRA). The MMR is then calculated as MMR = PM(D/B); where &quot;D&quot; is the number of all-cause deaths among women WRA and &quot;B&quot; is the number of live births. The number of live births is based upon the World Population Prospects published by UNDP. </p>\n<p>Statistical modelling is undertaken to generate comparable country, regional, and global level estimates. Adjustments are made according to the data source type (See Section 4e below). The analysis accounts for stochastic errors, sampling error in the data source, errors during data collection and processing, and other random error. The model&apos;s fit is assessed by cross-validation.</p>"}
