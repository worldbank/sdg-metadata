	<data>&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group (UN MMEIG) &amp;#x2013; comprising WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, the World Bank Group and the United Nations Population Division (UNDESA/Population Division) maintains an input database consisting of maternal mortality data from civil registration, population-based surveys, surveillance systems, censuses, and other specialized studies/surveys. This database is updated before the release of every new round of estimates and is used to calculate the proportion of maternal deaths (PM) among women of reproductive age (WRA). The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is then calculated as MMR = PM(D/B); where &amp;quot;D&amp;quot; is the number of all-cause deaths among women WRA and &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; is the number of live births. The number of live births is based upon the World Population Prospects published by UNDESA/Population Division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistical modelling is undertaken to generate comparable country, regional, and global level estimates. Adjustments are made according to the data source type (See Section 4e below). The analysis accounts for stochastic errors, sampling error in the data source, errors during data collection and processing, and other random error. The model&amp;apos;s fit is assessed by cross-validation.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
