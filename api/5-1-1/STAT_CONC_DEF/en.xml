	<message>The STAT_CONC_DEF field for indicator 5-1-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;h2&gt;Definitions:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicator 5.1.1 measures Government efforts to put in place legal frameworks that promote, enforce and monitor gender equality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is based on an assessment of legal frameworks that promote, enforce and monitor gender equality. The assessment is carried out by national counterparts, including National Statistical Offices (NSOs) and/or National Women&amp;#x2019;s Machinery (NWMs), and legal practitioners/researchers on gender equality, using a questionnaire comprising 42 yes/no questions under four areas of law: (i) overarching legal frameworks and public life; (ii) violence against women; (iii) employment and economic benefits; and (iv) marriage and family&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-2&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The areas of law and questions are drawn from the international legal and policy framework on gender equality, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which has 189 States parties, and the Beijing Platform for Action. As such, no new internationally agreed standard on equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex was needed. The primary sources of information relevant for indicator 5.1.1 are legislation and policy/action plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 42 questions in the questionnaire are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Area 1: Overarching legal frameworks and public life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Promote&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;If personal law is a valid source of law under the constitution, is it invalid if it violates constitutional provisions on equality or non-discrimination? &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Have provisions reducing penalties in cases of so-called honor crimes been removed, or never existed in legislation?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are laws on rape based on lack of consent, without requiring proof of physical force or penetration? &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Is there legislation that specifically addresses sexual harassment? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enforce and monitor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are there budgetary commitments provided for by government entities for the implementation of legislation addressing violence against women by creating an obligation on the government to provide a budget or allocation of funding for the implementation of relevant programs or activities? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are there budgetary commitments provided by government entities for the implementation of legislation addressing violence against women by allocating a specific budget, funding, and/or incentives to support non-governmental organizations for activities to address violence against women? &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article 1 of CEDAW provides a comprehensive definition of discrimination against women covering direct and indirect discrimination and article 2 sets out general obligations for States, in particular on required legal frameworks, to eliminate discrimination against women. Article 1 of CEDAW states: &amp;#x201C;&amp;#x2026; the term &amp;quot;discrimination against women&amp;quot; shall mean any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field&amp;#x201D;. Article 2 of CEDAW states: States Parties condemn discrimination against women in all its forms, agree to pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating discrimination against women and, to this end, undertake: (a) To embody the principle of the equality of men and women in their national constitutions or other appropriate legislation if not yet incorporated therein and to ensure, through law and other appropriate means, the practical realization of this principle; (b) To adopt appropriate legislative and other measures, including sanctions where appropriate, prohibiting all discrimination against women; (c) To establish legal protection of the rights of women on an equal basis with men and to ensure through competent national tribunals and other public institutions the effective protection of women against any act of discrimination; (d) To refrain from engaging in any act or practice of discrimination against women and to ensure that public authorities and institutions shall act in conformity with this obligation; (e) To take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women by any person, organization or enterprise; (f) To take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to modify or abolish existing laws, regulations, customs and practices which constitute discrimination against women; (g) To repeal all national penal provisions which constitute discrimination against women&amp;#x201D;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;#x201C;legal frameworks&amp;#x201D; is defined broadly to encompass laws, mechanisms, and policies/plans to &amp;#x2018;promote, enforce and monitor&amp;#x2019; gender equality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal frameworks that &amp;#x201C;promote&amp;#x201D; are those that establish women&amp;#x2019;s equal rights with men and enshrine non-discrimination based on sex. Legal frameworks that &amp;#x201C;enforce and monitor&amp;#x2019; are directed to the realization of equality and non-discrimination and implementation of laws, such as policies/plans, the establishment of enforcement and monitoring mechanisms, and allocation of financial resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-2&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; The areas of law were agreed at the expert workshop, held on 14 and 15 June 2016, to discuss the methodological development of SDG indicator 5.1.1. &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</data>
