	<message>The SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS field for indicator 5-1-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;There are other legal SDGs indicators: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; Indicator 5.a.2, &amp;#x2018;Proportion of countries where the legal framework (including customary law) guarantees women&amp;#x2019;s equal rights to land ownership and/or control&amp;#x2019;; and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; Indicator 5.6.2, &amp;#x2018;Number of countries with laws and regulations that guarantee full and equal access to women and men aged 15 years and older to sexual and reproductive health care, information and education&amp;#x2019;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid duplication, indicator 5.1.1 does not cover areas of law that are addressed under indicators 5.a.2 and 5.6.2. Indicator 5.1.1 complements these other indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal frameworks that advance gender equality generally relate to all of Goal 5 as well as other Goals since gender equality is central to the achievement of all SDGs. See UN Women and UN Statistics Division&amp;#x2019;s annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/gender-snapshot/2021/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals: The Gender Snapshot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which each year uses latest available data to demonstrate how gender equality, including progress on Target 5.1, is fundamental to achievement of all 17 Goals. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
