	<message>The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 5-1-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Countries are asked to designate a focal point to undertake the coordination at the country level necessary for the collection and validation of the data. Most designated focal points are within the NWMs, a number are within the NSOs and some are within both the NWMs and the NSOs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After verification, the data with relevant laws, polices and other sources included, are sent to the designated focal points/country counterparts to review and validate. Final answers are arrived at after the process of validation with country counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
