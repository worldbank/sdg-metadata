	<message>The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 16-7-1b, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The countries are requested to input the indicator in a reporting platform that provides separate fields for the metadata and statistics. By providing the metadata and statistics the custodian can identify possible inconsistencies and have further consultation with the national partner to validate the statistics provided. The fields used to comprehend/verify and validate refer to: the primary source of information; the excluded units&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-16&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-16&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and public servants&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-17&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-17&quot;&gt;[16]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; the corresponding grades and levels in the cases of countries that have not implemented ISCO-08; the inclusion/exclusion of appointed civil servants in the reported statistics; information and sources of disaggregation on sex, age and disability. Additionally, the reporting platform requests any additional methodological deviation that might exist between the collected statistics and the recommendations provided in the metadata. In addition to the metadata the countries are requested to input the nominator and denominator separately, as well as the disaggregated statistics, thus allowing to collect the information at a refined level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-16&quot;&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is recommended to exclude local government units, military and Public corporations and quasi-corporations owned and controlled by government units. &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-16&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-17&quot;&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is recommended to excluded the appointed senior managers and other managers. &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-17&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</data>
