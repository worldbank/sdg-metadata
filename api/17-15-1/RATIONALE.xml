			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Measuring the alignment of development partners&amp;#x2019; support to country priorities in terms of intervention design and type of results-reporting mechanisms provides a relevant assessment regarding the degree of &amp;#x201C;respect for each country&amp;#x2019;s policy space and leadership to establish and implement country-owned policies for poverty eradication and sustainable development&amp;#x201D;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, for interventions approved in the year of reference (i.e. most recent behaviour), the assessment measures the extent to which support from other countries and international organizations set exogenous priorities and conditions to partner countries receiving development co-operation that are not reflected in existing country-led priority-setting mechanisms or planning tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information collected throughout the indicator provides a &amp;#x201C;two-way mirror&amp;#x201D;, providing both a country-level estimate on a country&amp;#x2019;s existing policy space, and a development partner-level estimate on its degree of alignment with existing results frameworks and priority-setting mechanisms in partner countries where it operates. &lt;/p&gt;
