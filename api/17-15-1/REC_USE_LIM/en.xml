	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 17-15-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The Global Partnership monitoring exercise collects data beyond the scope of the proposed indicator, including additional aspects such as quality of national development planning, the enabling environment of civil society organisations, the quality of public-private dialogue, the predictability of development co-operation, and the use of country public financial management systems by providers of development co-operation. Data generated from the Global Partnership monitoring provide evidence for two additional SDG indicators: 17.16.1 and 5.c.1. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
