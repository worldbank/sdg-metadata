{"status":"success","message":"The INST_MANDATE field for indicator 6-6-1b, translated into en","data":"<p>At the 52nd meeting of the Standing Committee (SC52) in 2016, Contracting Parties of the Convention on Wetlands approved the inclusion of an indicator on wetland extent in the National Report to COP13. Subsequently, the UN General Assembly in July 2017 adopted the global indicator framework (A/RES/71/313) that included Indicator 6.6.1 on change in the extent of water-related ecosystems over time. Given that Contracting Parties were reporting on extent as part of the National Reports, the Interagency Expert Group on SDGs in 2017 appointed the Convention on Wetlands as co-custodian of Indicator 6.6.1 using data coming from National Reports, which used as a main source wetland inventories.</p>\n<p>As noted in Resolution XIII.7 Enhancing the Convention&#x2019;s visibility and synergies with other multilateral environmental agreements and other international institutions, the Convention on Wetlands is co-custodian with UNEP of SDG Indicator 6.6.1. The Convention contributes to monitoring progress with data from National Reports on extent of wetlands, based on the Convention&#x2019;s definitions and requirements for reporting. </p>\n<p>Paragraph 40 of Resolution XIII.7 &#x201C;requests the Secretariat to continue working with Contracting Parties on the completion of national wetland inventories and wetland extent to report on SDG Indicator 6.6.1&#x201D;.</p>\n<p>The Standing Committee at its 54th and 57th meetings, through Decisions SC54-26 and <br>SC57-47, approved the allocation of funds to support Contracting Parties in the completion of wetland inventories and report on wetland extent under Indicator 6.6.1. </p>"}
