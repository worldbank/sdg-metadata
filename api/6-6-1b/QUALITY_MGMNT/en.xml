	<message>The QUALITY_MGMNT field for indicator 6-6-1b, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;At the 52nd meeting of the Standing Committee (SC52) in 2016, Contracting Parties of the Convention on Wetlands approved the inclusion of an indicator on wetland extent in the National Report to COP13. The Secretariat provides guidance and training to Contracting Parties for the submission of National Reports to COP13/COP14 and developed a toolkit and training on wetlands inventories to enable them to provide data that could be used for SDG Indicator 6.6.1 reporting. The Secretariat also works with Parties to complete and refine information on extent that has been submitted to the Secretariat and to identify information that is available in existing inventories referred in National Reports, that has not been used to report on wetland extent. Through this mechanism, national validated data using accepted international definitions of wetlands are provided to measure the extent of water-related ecosystems under SDG 6. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
