	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 6-6-1b, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Wetland area (Km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or ha, reference year)/Change in the extent of wetlands (water-related ecosystems over time) a baseline reference and year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based upon the national wetland inventory (complete or partial), countries provide a baseline figure in square kilometres for the extent of wetlands (according to the Ramsar definition) for the year 2017. The minimum information that should be provided is the total area of wetlands for each of the three major categories; &amp;#x201C;marine/coastal&amp;#x201D;, &amp;#x201C;inland&amp;#x201D; and &amp;#x201C;human-made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the information is available, countries indicate the % change in the extent of wetlands over the last three years. If the period of data covers more than three years, countries provide the available information, and indicate the period of the change. For reporting such change, the previous extent, if known, and the period over which the change has taken place should be specified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator can be aggregated to global or regional level by adding all country values globally or in a specific region. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
