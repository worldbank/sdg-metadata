{"status":"success","message":"The IMPUTATION field for indicator 12-2-2, translated into en","data":"<ul>\n  <li><strong>At country level </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A zero is imputed when no positive real value was officially recorded, in the base data sets used, for any of the underlying components which make up this aggregated total. Thus &#x201C;0.0&#x201D; can represent either NA, or a genuine 0.0, or (crucially) a combination of both, which is a common situation. This allows for values to be easily aggregated into further aggregations; however, it should be thus noted that due to imputing missing values as &#x2018;0.0&#x2019;, the aggregations may represent a lower value than actual situation. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>At regional and global levels </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Similarly, missing values are imputed as zero in the regional and global aggregations. However, in the case where no data is available at all for a particular country then the per capita and per GDP estimates are weighted averages of the available data. </p>"}
