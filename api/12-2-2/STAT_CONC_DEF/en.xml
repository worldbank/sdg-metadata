&lt;p&gt;Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a standard material flow accounting (MFA) indicator and reports the apparent consumption of materials in a national economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DMC measures the total amount of material (biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores and non-metallic minerals) directly used in an economy and based on accounts of direct material flows, i.e., domestic material extraction and physical imports and exports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concepts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DMC and Material Footprint (MF) need to be looked at in combination, as they cover the two aspects of the economy, production and consumption. The DMC reports the actual amount of material in an economy, MF the virtual amount required across the whole supply chain to service final demand. A country can, for instance, have a very high DMC because it has a large primary production sector for export or a very low DMC because it has outsourced most of the material intensive industrial process to other countries. The material footprint corrects for both phenomena. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
