GFS Expenditure series are reported by the economic classification in Tables 2, and 3 (items under code 31). Alternatively, for those countries that report total expenditure according to the functional classification (COFOG) in GFS Table 7, a similar calculation can be made. The <em>Proportion of domestic budgetary central government expenditure funded by taxes</em> will be calculated as (Taxes / Expenditure expressed as a %) using the following data series:</p>\n<p>An Example: Calculation of SDG Indicator 17.1.2<br></p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Total Revenue</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>963</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong> </strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Expenditure</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>1200</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Taxes</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>800</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Expense</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>950</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Social contributions</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>105</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">\n        <p>Net acquisition of nonfinancial assets</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>250</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Grants</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>25</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Other revenue</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>33</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p> </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>SDG Indicator 17.1.2</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>67%</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Consistency across countries will be ensured through the underlying structure of the IMF GFS database and application of one simple mathematical formula to make computations on the country reported source data used to produce the indicator (no adjustments and/or weighting techniques will be applied).
