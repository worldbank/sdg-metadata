	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 5-3-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;There are existing tools and mechanisms for data collection that countries have implemented to monitor the situation with regards to this indicator. The modules used to collect information on marital status among women and men of reproductive age (15-49 years) in the DHS and MICS have been fully harmonized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure of child marriage is retrospective in nature by design, capturing age at first marriage among a population that has completed the risk period (i.e., adult women). While it is also possible to measure the current marital status of girls under age 18, such measures would provide an underestimate of the level of child marriage, as girls who are not currently married may still do so before they turn 18. For more details on interpretation and common pitfalls for this indicator, see: &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/A-Generation-to-Protect-publication-English_2020.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Generation to Protect: Monitoring violence exploitation and abuse of children within the SDG framework&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(UNICEF 2020).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
