Child marriage often compromises a girl&#x2019;s development by resulting in early pregnancy and social isolation, interrupting her schooling, limiting her opportunities for career and vocational advancement and placing her at increased risk of intimate partner violence.

The practice of early/child marriage is a direct manifestation of gender inequality. </p>\n<p>The issue of child marriage is addressed in a number of international conventions and agreements.
