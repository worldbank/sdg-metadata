This process is reinforced through IRENA&#x2019;s renewable energy statistics training workshops, which are held twice a year in different (rotating) regions. To date, over 200 energy statisticians have participated in these workshops, many of whom provide renewable energy data to IRENA. In addition, IRENA&#x2019;s statistics are presented each year to member countries at one of IRENA&#x2019;s three governing body meetings, where discrepancies or other data issues can be discussed with country representatives.</p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
