According to the SNA, &#x201C;GDP is the sum of gross value added of all resident producer units plus that part (possibly the total) of taxes on products, less subsidies on products, that is not included in the valuation of output &#x2026; GDP is also equal to the sum of the final uses of goods and services (all uses except intermediate consumption) measured at purchasers&#x2019; prices, less the value of imports of goods and services GDP is also equal to the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units.&#x201D; </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP): Real GDP refers to GDP calculated at constant prices, that is, the volume level of GDP, excluding the effect of inflation and favouring comparisons of quantities beyond price changes. Constant price estimates of GDP are calculated by expressing values in terms of a base period. In theory, the price and quantity components of a value are identified and the price in the base period is substituted for that in the current period. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Employment: All persons of working age who, during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. </p><p>Percentage</p><p>Not applicable</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> </p>\n<p>Output measures used in the numerator of this indicator (Gross Domestic Product) are best obtained from the production side of national accounts and represent, as much as possible, GDP at market prices for the aggregate economy (adjusted for inflation, in constant prices). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Employment data used in the denominator are preferably derived from labour force or other household surveys with an employment module. In the absence of a household survey, establishment surveys, administrative records or official estimates based on reliable sources can be used as well as population censuses. It is however important to note that employment data from establishment surveys will capture the number of jobs and not the number of persons employed as preferred for the denominator. Also, establishment surveys cover, in many cases, the formal sector and employers and employees only, not accounting for the whole economy. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When calculating this indicator, it is important to ensure that the coverage of the employment data is consistent with that of the national accounts. </p><p>For the purposes of international reporting on the SDG indicators, the ILO uses country-level estimates of GDP in constant 2010 US$ from the World Bank&#x2019;s World Development Indicators database and country-level estimates on employment from household surveys or derived from the ILO modelled estimates to calculate levels and growth rates of labour productivity at the country, regional and global levels. </p><p>Continuous</p><p>ILO estimates of labour productivity are part of the ILO modelled estimates series, analysed in the ILO&apos;s World Employment and Social Outlook reports. The ILO estimates are released once per year (in November or December). </p><p>Input GDP and employment data are provided by national statistical offices, and in some cases labour ministries or other related agencies. </p><p>ILO </p><p> The ILO is the UN focal point for labour statistics. It sets international standards for labour statistics through the International Conference of Labour Statisticians. It also compiles and produces labour statistics with the goal of disseminating internationally-comparable datasets, and provides technical assistance and training to ILO member States to support their efforts to produce high quality labour market data.</p><p>Real GDP per employed person being a measure of labour productivity, this indicator represents a measure of labour productivity growth, thus providing information on the evolution, efficiency and quality of human capital in the production process. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Economic growth in a country can be ascribed to many factors, including increased employment and more effective work by those who are employed. This indicator casts light on the latter effect, therefore being a key measure of economic performance. Labour productivity (and growth) estimates can support the formulation of labour market policies and monitor their effects. They can also contribute to the understanding of how labour market performance affects living standards. </p><p>Output measures are obtained from national accounts and represent, as much as possible, GDP at market prices for the aggregate economy. However, despite common principles that are mostly based on the United Nations System of National Accounts, there are still significant problems in international consistency of national accounts estimates, based on factors such as differences in the treatment of output in services sectors, differences in methods used to correct output measures for price changes (in particular, the use of different weighting systems to obtain deflators) and differences in the degree of coverage of informal economic activities. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Data on employment used in the denominator of this indicator refer, as much as possible, to the average number of persons with one or more paid jobs during the year. That is, the reliability of the employment data is also dependent on the degree of coverage of informal activities by the statistical source used. </p><p><math

Además, las encuestas de establecimientos cubren, en muchos casos, sólo el sector formal y los empleadores y empleados, y no dan cuenta de toda la economía.</p>\n<p>Al calcular este indicador, es importante asegurarse de que la cobertura de los datos de empleo sea coherente con la de las cuentas nacionales.</p><h2>Proceso de recolección:</h2>\n<p>A efectos de la elaboración de informes internacionales sobre los indicadores de los ODS, la OIT utiliza estimaciones del PIB a nivel de país en dólares constantes de 2010 procedentes de la base de datos de los Indicadores del Desarrollo Mundial del Banco Mundial y estimaciones a nivel de país sobre el empleo procedentes de encuestas de hogares o derivadas de las estimaciones modeladas de la OIT para calcular los niveles y las tasas de crecimiento de la productividad laboral a nivel nacional, regional y mundial.</p><h1> Calendario</h1>\n<h2> Recopilación de datos:</h2><h2>Publicación de datos:</h2>\n<p>Las estimaciones de la OIT sobre la productividad del trabajo forman parte de la serie de estimaciones modelizadas de la OIT, que se analizan en los informes de la OIT sobre el empleo y las perspectivas sociales en el mundo.

Кроме того, обследования предприятий во многих случаях охватывают только организованный сектор, работодателей и наемных работников, а не всю экономику. </p>\n<p> При расчете этого показателя важно убедиться, что охват данных по занятости соответствует охвату, используемому в национальных счетах. </p><h2> Процесс сбора: </h2>\n<p> Для целей международной отчетности по показателям ЦУР Международная организация труда использует страновые оценки ВВП в постоянных долларах США 2010 года из базы данных Всемирного банка «Показатели мирового развития» и страновые оценки занятости на основе обследований домашних хозяйств или полученные из отчета МОТ \"Эконометрические модели тенденций\" (ЭМТ) для расчета уровней и темпов роста производительности труда на страновом, региональном и глобальном уровнях. </p><h1>Календарь</h1>\n<h2>Сбор данных:</h2><h2> Выпуск данных: </h2>\n<p> Оценки МОТ производительности труда являются частью смоделированных МОТ рядов оценок, рассмотренных в докладах МОТ «Перспективы мировой занятости и социальной сферы». Оценки МОТ публикуются один раз в год (январь). </p><h1> Поставщики данных </h1>\n<p> Национальные статистические управления, а в некоторых случаях министерства труда или другие связанные агентства. </p>\n<h1> Составители данных </h1>\n<p> МОТ. </p><h2> Обоснование: </h2>\n<p> Реальный ВВП на каждого занятого, являясь мерой производительности труда, представляет собой меру роста производительности труда, таким образом предоставляя информацию об эволюции, эффективности и качестве человеческого капитала в производственном процессе. </p>\n<p> Экономический рост в стране можно объяснить многими факторами, включающими рост занятости и более эффективную работу тех, кто занят. Этот показатель проливает свет на последний из двух факторов, поэтому он является ключевым показателем экономической продуктивности. Оценки производительности труда (и роста) могут содействовать формулированию политики на рынке труда и отслеживать ее влияние. Они также могут способствовать пониманию того, как показатели рынка труда влияют на уровень жизни. </p><h2> Комментарии и ограничения: </h2>\n<p> Показатели продукции получаются из национальных счетов и в максимально возможной степени представляют ВВП в рыночных ценах для экономики в целом. Однако, несмотря на общие принципы, которые в основном базируются на Системе национальных счетов Организации Объединенных Наций, все еще существуют значительные проблемы с международной согласованностью оценок национальных счетов, вызванные такими факторами, как различия в подходе к продукции в секторах услуг, различия в методах, используемых для корректировки показателей продукции с учетом изменений цен (в частности, использование различных систем взвешивания для получения дефляторов) и различия в степени охвата неформальной экономической деятельности. </p>\n<p> Данные по занятости, используемые в знаменателе этого показателя, в максимально возможной степени относятся к среднему количеству лиц, имеющих одно или несколько оплачиваемых рабочих мест в течение года. То есть надежность данных по занятости также зависит от степени охвата неформальной деятельности, который используется статистическим источником. </p><h1> Методология </h1>\n<h2> Метод расчета: </h2>\n<p> Реальный ВВП на каждого занятого = ВВП в постоянных ценах / общая занятость </p>\n<p> Числитель и знаменатель приведенного выше уравнения должны относиться к одному и тому же отчетному периоду, например, к одному календарному году. </p>\n<p> Если мы обозначим реальный ВВП на каждого занятого как&#x201C; LabProd&#x201D;, то годовые темпы роста реального ВВП на каждого занятого рассчитываются следующим образом: </p>\n<p> Годовые темпы роста реального ВВП на каждого занятого </p>\n<p> = ((LabProd в год n) &#x2013; (LabProd в год n-1)) / ((LabProd в год n-1)) x 100 </p><h2> Обработка отсутствующих значений: </h2>\n<ul>\n  <li> <strong> <em> На страновом уровне: </em> </strong> </li>\n</ul>\n<p> Для вменения отсутствующих значений занятости на страновом уровне используются методы многомерной регрессии. </p>\n<p> Дополнительную информацию об оценках см. в методологическом обзоре смоделированных оценок МОТ, доступном по адресу <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/TEM.pdf\">https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/TEM.pdf </a> \n<ul>\n <li><strong><em>На региональном и глобальном уровнях:</em> </strong> </li>\n</ul><h2> Региональные агрегаты: </h2>\n<p> Для решения проблемы отсутствующих данных Международная организация труда разработала несколько эконометрических моделей, которые используются для получения оценок показателей рынка труда в странах и по годам, по которым отсутствуют реальные данные. Данные по занятости, полученные на основе смоделированных МОТ оценок, используются для оценки производительности труда. В этих моделях используются методы многомерной регрессии для вменения отсутствующих значений на страновом уровне, которые затем агрегируются для получения региональных и глобальных оценок.
