UN Environment (United Nations Environment Programme), in collaboration with partners mentioned in the other sections of this metadata</p><p>From an ecological perspective, ecosystem approaches consider the connections between the living organisms, habitats, physical and chemical conditions within an ecosystem, focusing on the importance of ecological integrity, biodiversity and overall ecosystem health. From a management perspective, ecosystem-based approaches refer to integrated management strategies for socio-ecological systems that consider ecological, social and economic factors and apply principles of sustainable development. </p>\n<p>A marine or coastal area-based (or spatial) management promotes better management of EEZs. Many countries use Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) and Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) as their approach for ensuring appropriate ecosystem-based management, including issues that are cross-sectoral and wider scale in nature.</p><p>The Indicator only measures the policy formulation and not policy implementation.</p><p>A full methodology for this indicator is available in the document entitled, &#x201C;Global Manual on Ocean Statistics for Measuring SDG 14.1.1, 14.2.1 and 14.5.1&#x201D;.</p>\n<p>Regional Seas Coordinated Indicator 22 &#x2018;Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) is proposed as the primary indicator.
