	<message>The ADJUSTMENT field for indicator 3-7-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Generally, there is no discrepancy between data presented and data published in survey reports. However, some published national data have been adjusted by the Population Division to improve comparability. Notes are used in the data set to indicate when adjustments were made and where data differed from standard definitions. Surveys might differ in the classification of modern and traditional methods. To improve comparability of data over time and across countries, method classifications used in some survey are adjusted to follow the classification described above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global indicator represents all women of reproductive age. Some survey estimates represent women who are married or in a union and this is indicated in a note. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
