	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 3-7-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The proportion of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods is useful in assessing overall levels of coverage for family planning programmes and services. Access to and use of an effective means to prevent pregnancy helps enable women and their partners to exercise their rights to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information, education and means to do so. Meeting demand for family planning with modern methods also contributes to maternal and child health by preventing unintended pregnancies and closely spaced pregnancies, which are at higher risk for poor obstetrical outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levels of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods of 75 percent or more are generally considered high, and values of 50 percent or less are generally considered as very low. The indicator has no global numerical &amp;#x2018;target&amp;#x2019; value set to be achieved by 2030. Looking at the highest values of the indicator, in 22 countries representing regions such as Europe and Northern America, Latin America and the Caribbean and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, more than 85 percent of women who want to avoid pregnancy are using a modern contraceptive method but for no country is this estimate above 91 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in these countries, specific sub-populations (for example, adolescents or the poor) can still face barriers of access to family planning information and services. It should also be recognized that reaching 100 percent may not be a necessary or even desirable outcome with respect to reproductive rights. Some women may prefer to use a traditional method, even while having access to a full range of modern methods and being aware of the typical differences in effectiveness of methods in preventing pregnancies. Other women might have ambivalent preferences regarding their next pregnancy which may influence their contraceptive choice.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
