			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;For surveys with microdata sets available, the indicators are calculated following the definitions and concepts described above. These results are compared with the indicators published in survey reports, SDG national reporting platforms, or obtained from ad hoc queries. In some cases of discrepancies, the results are consulted with the national institutions that conducted the survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For model-based estimates and projections, out-of-sample validation methods are described in Kantorov&amp;#xE1; V., M. Wheldon, P. Ueffing., A. N. Z. Dasgupta (2020).
