  &lt;li&gt;At country level &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no attempt to provide estimates for individual countries or areas when country or area data are not available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For analytical and comparative purposes, country-level model-based estimates and projections are generated using a Bayesian hierarchical model (see references below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At regional and global levels &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to generate regional and global estimates for any given reference year, the Population Division/DESA uses a Bayesian hierarchical model, described in detail in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkema et al (2013) and Kantorov&amp;#xE1; et al (2020).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Country-level, model-based estimates are only used for computing regional and global averages and are not used for global SDG reporting of trends at the country level. However, the model-based estimates are recommended to be used for analytical and comparative purposes. Since the model takes into account the relationship of family planning indicators - contraceptive use of any, modern and traditional methods, unmet need for family planning &amp;#x2013; the information from surveys that only provide data on contraceptive use (and have no information on unmet need for family planning) is considered as well. The model is providing estimates of the indicator for countries and years without direct survey data by extrapolating underlying trends determined using data across all countries. The model implicitly weights observations from other countries such that higher weights are given to observations from more similar countries. The fewer the number of observations for the country of interest, the more its estimates are driven by the experience of other countries, whereas for countries with many observations the results are determined to a greater extent by those empirical observations.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
