			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;For CBD ABSCLRHS and ER_CBD_NAGOYA, and ER_CBD_PTYPGRFA and ER_CBD_ORSPGRFA, there is a need for the data compilers to subtract the European Union from regional and global aggregations. The European Union is a Party to the Nagoya Protocol and the International Treaty, but is not counted as a country for these indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ER_CBD_SMTA, the SMTA is a private contract, therefore it is reported by users, not by a government focal point. Users have also a two-year period for reporting their SMTAs, and therefore the number reported for a specific year would be fixed in two years (may also change during the two years). &lt;/p&gt;
