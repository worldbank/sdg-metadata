	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data is collected from the existing online platforms of the two instruments (see 3.a above). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the ABS Clearing-House, a country must complete and publish a common format for legislative, administrative, or policy measures. The common format can be downloaded at the following link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbd.int/abs/common-formats/en/ABSCH-MSR-en.doc&quot;&gt;https://www.cbd.int/abs/common-formats/en/ABSCH-MSR-en.doc&lt;/a&gt;. Once the format is completed, it is published as a national record on the ABS Clearing-House and the country will be henceforth counted as having a measure in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the International Treaty, countries (Contracting Parties) submit a national report regarding their implementation of the provisions of the International Treaty under the compliance procedure, using the standard reporting format. The submitted national reports are available at the following link: https://www.fao.org/plant-treaty/areas-of-work/compliance/compliance-reports/en/&lt;/p&gt;
