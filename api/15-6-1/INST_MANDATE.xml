The Protocol requires Parties to make information on legislative, administrative and policy measures available to the ABS Clearing-House. Non-Parties are also encouraged to make this information available in the same manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to promote compliance with all the provisions of the International Treaty, including access and benefit sharing obligations, and to address issues of non-compliance, the Governing Body of the International Treaty has approved the procedures and operational mechanisms by Resolution 2/2011. Under V. 1, it is noted that each Contracting Party is to submit to the Compliance Committee, established by the Governing Body by Resolution 3/2006, through the Secretary, a report on the measures it has taken to implement its obligations under the International Treaty in one of the six languages of the United Nations. Contracting Parties have submitted their report by using a standard reporting format approved by the Governing Body, sending it to the Secretary. The Secretariat of the International Treaty prepares an analysis of reports received from Contracting Parties for consideration by the Compliance Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relevant Resolutions of the Governing Body: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/3/a-be452e.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/3/a-be452e.pdf&lt;/a&gt; (Resolution 2/2011); &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/3/a-mn566e.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/3/a-mn566e.pdf&lt;/a&gt; (Resolution 9/2013)&lt;/p&gt;
