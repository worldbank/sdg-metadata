	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 15-6-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliability of the indicator is dependent on countries making information available to the ABS Clearing-House of the Nagoya Protocol and to the Online Reporting System on Compliance of the International Treaty on ABS legislative, administrative or policy measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the information made available by countries to the ABS Clearing-House, the CBD Secretariat collects information from other sources: national biodiversity strategies and actions plans, national reports submitted under the CBD, national reports on the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol,and official communications to the SCBD (responses to notifications, email communications, etc.). The information collected from these sources inform the Secretariat&amp;#x2019;s inputs to other processes under the Protocol, in particular the consideration by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Protocol (COP-MOP) of national reports (Article 29) and assessment and review (Article 31). The resulting information on the number of countries with ABS legislative, administrative or and policy measures may differ from the number of countries that have made available this information in the ABS Clearing-House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the information made available by countries to the Online Reporting System on Compliance of the International Treaty, FAO collects information from countries, submitted through their national reports, on conservation and use of PGRFA and their efforts in this regard for the preparation of the &lt;em&gt;State of the World&amp;#x2019;s Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
