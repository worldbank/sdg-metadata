			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;This indicator measures the per capita expenditure (public and private) in the preservation, protection and conservation of cultural and/or natural heritage over time. To monitor change over time of national efforts for the protection and safeguard of cultural and/or natural heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator illustrates how financial efforts/actions made by public authorities, both at the local, national and international levels, alone or in partnership with civil society organizations (CSO) and the private sector, to protect and safeguard the world&amp;#x2019;s cultural and natural heritage has a direct impact in making cities and human settlements more sustainable. This means that cultural resources and assets are safeguarded to keep attracting/to attract people (inhabitants, workers, tourists, etc.) and financial investments, to ultimately enhance the total amount of expenditure. This indicator is a proxy to measure the target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator would allow insight into whether or not countries are strengthening their efforts into safeguarding their cultural and natural heritage. It will help to identify areas that require more attention for policy purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expressing the indicator in PPP$ allows for comparison between countries and using constant values when looking at time-series is necessary to evaluate how real (eliminating the effects of inflation) resources evolve over time.&lt;/p&gt;
