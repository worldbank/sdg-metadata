&lt;p&gt;At national level, ministries of finance, and/or ministries of culture, environment financial management systems are the source of government expenditure on culture. Data on expenditure by lower levels of government can be centralized or collected directly from local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Household expenditure on culture is collected through general consumption expenditure surveys or dedicated cultural participation and consumption surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;For private expenditure:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on other private sources of funding for heritage such (e.g. corporate sponsorship and philanthropy; private donations) are rarely collected systematically and would often require additional surveys proceeded by significant analytical, preparatory and advocacy work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International sources may be available through governmental financial systems when they are recorded on-budget, and off-budget international funding may sometimes be available through governmental aid management systems, although rarely with the disaggregation needed (ex. For heritage only). Data sources for international funding, such as the Official Development Aid data from the OECD-DAC database may be used as a complement, but often present problems of compatibility with other sources, such as government records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UIS produces the indicator based on the population estimates produced by the UN Population Division.&lt;/p&gt;
