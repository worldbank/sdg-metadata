	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 11-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first data collection on SDG 11.4.1 in 2020, 50 countries representing 24% of all countries worldwide completed the UIS questionnaire. Due to lack of available data, less than 30 were able to calculate the indicator fully or partially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The availability of private expenditure on heritage is limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If further disaggregation is not available at national level, the identification of cultural and natural heritage using the COFOG classification in public Finance statistics is not always straightforward. This explains why some countries were not able to report the relevant data to calculate SDG 11.4.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual data collection as of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disaggregated by source of funding (public, private) &lt;br&gt;Disaggregated by type of heritage (cultural, natural)&lt;br&gt;Disaggregated by type of level of government (national, regional and local/municipal)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantifiable derivatives (1). Comparison of the relative expenditures in heritage with GDP per capita of countries, which will provide a complementary measure of a nation&amp;#x2019;s capacities and levels of development.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
