The results should be express in Purchasing Power Parities (PPP) in constant $. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural heritage:&lt;/strong&gt; includes artefacts, monuments, a group of buildings and sites, museums that have a diversity of values including symbolic, historic, artistic, aesthetic, ethnological or anthropological, scientific and social significance. It includes tangible heritage (movable, immobile and underwater), intangible heritage (ICH) embedded into cultural, and natural heritage artefacts, sites or monuments. The definition excludes ICH related to other cultural domains such as festivals, celebration etc. It covers industrial heritage and cave paintings. Mixed heritage that refer to sites containing elements of both natural and cultural significance are including in cultural heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natural heritage&lt;/strong&gt;: refers to natural features, geological and physiographical formations and delineated areas that constitute the habitat of threatened species of animals and plants and natural sites of value from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty. It includes private and publically protected natural areas, zoos, aquaria and botanical gardens, natural habitat, marine ecosystems, sanctuaries and reservoirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conservation&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;of cultural heritage&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the measures taken to extend the life of cultural heritage while strengthening transmission of its significant heritage messages and values. In the domain of cultural property, the aim of conservation is to maintain the physical and cultural characteristics of the object to ensure that its value is not diminished and that it will outlive our limited time span.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conservation of natural heritage&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the protection, care, management and maintenance of ecosystems, habitats, wildlife species and populations, within or outside of their natural environments, in order to safeguard the natural conditions for their long-term permanence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of&lt;strong&gt; Preservation &lt;/strong&gt;is to obviate damage liable to be caused by environmental or accidental factors, which pose a threat in the immediate surroundings of the object to be conserved. Accordingly, preventive methods and measures are not usually applied directly but are designed to control the microclimatic conditions of the environment with the aim of eradicating harmful agents or elements, which may have a temporary or permanent influence on the deterioration of the object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protection&lt;/strong&gt;: is the act or process of applying measures designed to affect the physical condition of a property by defending or guarding it from deterioration, loss or attack, or to cover or shield the property from danger or injury. In the case of buildings and structures, such treatment is generally of a temporary nature and anticipates future historic preservation treatment; in the case of archaeological sites, the protective measure may be temporary or permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public expenditure&lt;/strong&gt; refers to spending on heritage incurred by public funds. Public funds are state, regional and local government bodies (Adapted from OECD glossary). Expenditure that is not directly related to cultural and natural heritage is, in principle, not included. Public expenditure in the preservation, protection and conservation of national cultural and/or natural heritage covers direct expenditure (including subsides), transfers and indirect public expenditures including tax incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct public expenditure&lt;/strong&gt; includes subsidies, grants and awards. Direct expenditure comprises generally spent on personnel, goods and services, capital investment and other heritage activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Transfer &lt;/strong&gt;is a transaction in which one institutional unit provides a good, service, or asset to another unit without receiving from the latter any good, service, or asset in return as a direct counterpart (IMF, 2014). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Net Intergovernmental transfers &lt;/strong&gt;are net transfers of funds designated for heritage activities from one level of government to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indirect public expenditures&lt;/strong&gt; include tax incentives&amp;#x2013; reduction of taxable income that arises due to several of heritage expenses incurred by a taxpayer&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National/Federal level &lt;/strong&gt;consists of the institutional units of central government and non-market institutions controlled by central government. Central government expends their authority over the entire territory of country. It is responsible for providing heritage services for the benefit of the community as a whole, but also it may make transfers to other institutional units, as well levels of government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regional/State/Provincial level &lt;/strong&gt;is a subdivision of government, which shares political, fiscal and economic power with central government. In federal government, regional level is represented by state government. In unitary states, regional government is known as a provincial government. This level of government consists of institutional units, which have some of the functions of government at a level below of that of central government and above the local level. A regional government usually has the fiscal authority to raise taxes within its territory and has the ability to spend at least some of its income according to its own policies, and appoint or elect its own officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a regional unit is fully dependent on funds from the central government and a central government determines those funds, expenditures on regional level should be treated as a part of central government for statistical purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local/municipal level &lt;/strong&gt;is a public administration that exists at the lowest administration level within government state such as municipality of district. Local level refers to local government units, which consist of local government institutional units and nonmarket institutions controlled by local level. A local government often has the fiscal authority to raise taxes within its territory and should have the ability to spend at least some of its income according to its own policies, and appoint or elect its own officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Public expenditure on heritage &lt;/strong&gt;is consolidated expenditure on heritage made by national/federal, regional/States/Provincial and local governments. &lt;/p&gt;

By convention, ODA flows comprise contributions of donor government agencies, at all levels, to developing countries (&amp;#x201C;bilateral ODA&amp;#x201D;) and to multilateral institutions. ODA receipts comprise disbursements by bilateral donors and multilateral institutions. Lending by export credit agencies&amp;#x2014;with the pure purpose of export promotion is excluded.
