	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 11-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;1) In general, the availability of public expenditure data for heritage varies between countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) In general, the availability of private expenditure data for heritage is significantly lower so that it will take several years, capacity building, and financial investment in order to increase coverage to an acceptable level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator comprises public and private monetary investments in heritage. It does not measure non-monetary factors such as national regulations or national/local policies for the preservation, protection and conservation of national cultural and/or natural heritage including World Heritage. These policies could take the form of fiscal incentives such as tax benefits for donations or sponsorships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International definitions and concepts that will support the harmonization of the data and indicators for cultural and natural heritage will be defined according to the 2009 UNESCO Framework for cultural statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of existing international classifications such as the Classification of the Function of the Government (COFOG) could be used. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
