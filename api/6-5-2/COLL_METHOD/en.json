{"status":"success","message":"The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 6-5-2, translated into en","data":"<p>Data on transboundary basins and their operational arrangements has not been traditionally included within the National Statistical Systems but the information needed to calculate the indicator is simple, does not require advanced monitoring capacities and is normally available to all countries.</p>\n<p>Spatial information (&#x201C;transboundary basin area&#x201D;) is normally available in ministries in charge of water resources. Regarding the operationality of arrangement, the data needed for calculating the indicator can be directly obtained from information from administrative records (Member States have records of cooperation arrangements). </p>\n<p>The limitations in terms of comparability of the results between countries are the same as the ones described in Section 4.b. However, a clear definition and consideration of the criteria as developed in the detailed methodology is available to countries to ensure a common reference for the countries.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the elements of the indicator are based on the main principles of customary international water law, which are also contained in the two UN conventions &#x2013; 1997 Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses (Watercourses Convention) and the 1992 Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Water Convention) &#x2013; as well as the draft Articles on The Law of Transboundary Aquifers (2008; UN General Assembly resolutions 63/124, 66/104, 68/118, 71/150, 74/193 and 77/112).</p>\n<p>The mechanism of reporting under the Water Convention also allows for sub-components of the indicator to be reported by countries, which will ensure both more confidence on the final indicator value (validation) and increased comparability. </p>"}
