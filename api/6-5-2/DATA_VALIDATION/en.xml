	<message>The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 6-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Countries are requested to submit data on their transboundary basins covered by operational arrangements through the uses of a reporting template or questionnaire. The templates are submitted to the co-custodian agencies, UNECE and UNESCO for review. Countries are encouraged to submit drafts of their templates to the custodian agencies for feedback prior to the final submission. Once submitted, the custodian agencies review the national templates to assess firstly, whether sufficient and accurate information is provided in order to calculate the national SDG indicator value, and secondly, whether an official endorsement of the template is provided (in the form of a signature).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
