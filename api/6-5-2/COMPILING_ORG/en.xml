	<message>The COMPILING_ORG field for indicator 6-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;UNECE and UNESCO-IHP gather the information needed from the 153 countries sharing transboundary basins for the calculation of the indicator, especially on the transboundary basins (rivers, lakes and aquifers) shared by countries, the applicable cooperative arrangements, and their operationality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2017, the Water Convention&amp;#x2019;s regular reporting on transboundary water cooperation, commits its Parties to collect information relevant to SDG indicator 6.5.2, as part of an established mandatory mechanism for Parties every 3 years. The reporting covers transboundary rivers, lakes and groundwaters. More than 130 countries participate in the Water Convention&amp;#x2019;s activities, as non-Parties are also invited. UNECE acts as Secretariat for the Water Convention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some countries also report to regional organizations (e.g. the European Union or the Southern African Development Community) on the advancement of transboundary water cooperation, and similar arrangements could be strengthened and facilitated.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
