	<message>The DOC_METHOD field for indicator 6-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Through UN-Water, UNECE and UNESCO have developed a step-by-step methodology that countries can use to compile data at the national level on SDG indicator 6.5.2. The methodology, which was revised in January 2020 prior to the second reporting exercise, is available in English, French, Russian and Spanish through the UN-Water website - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unwater.org/publications/step-step-methodology-monitoring-transboundary-cooperation-6-5-2/&quot;&gt;https://www.unwater.org/publications/step-step-methodology-monitoring-transboundary-cooperation-6-5-2/&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, UNECE, through an expert group made up of both parties and non-parties to the Water Convention, developed a &lt;em&gt;Guide to reporting under the Water Convention and as a contribution to SDG indicator 6.5.2 (&lt;/em&gt;see&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unece.org/environment-policy/publications/guide-reporting-under-water-convention-and-contribution-sdg&quot;&gt;https://unece.org/environment-policy/publications/guide-reporting-under-water-convention-and-contribution-sdg&lt;/a&gt;) in January 2020. The guide, which is available in Arabic, English, French, Russian and Spanish, supports countries in the completion of the reporting template by explaining key terminology and providing examples of how particular questions might be addressed. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
