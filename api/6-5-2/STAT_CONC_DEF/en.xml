	<message>The STAT_CONC_DEF field for indicator 6-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator monitors the &amp;#x201C;transboundary basin&amp;#x201D; area within a country covered by an &amp;#x201C;operational&amp;#x201D; &amp;#x201C;arrangement for water cooperation&amp;#x201D;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &amp;#x201C;transboundary basin&amp;#x201D; refers to a river or lake basin, or an aquifer system that marks, crosses or is located on boundaries between two or more states. A basin comprises the entire catchment area of a surface water body (river or lake), or for groundwater, the area of the aquifer, i.e. the entire permeable water-bearing geological formation. For the purpose of calculating the value of SDG indicator 6.5.2 the transboundary basin area is the extent of the catchment area (river or lake basin); or the extent of the aquifer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;Arrangement for water cooperation&amp;#x201D; refers to a bilateral or multilateral treaty, convention, agreement or other formal arrangement, such as memorandum of understanding between countries sharing transboundary basins that provides a framework for cooperation on transboundary water management. Agreements or other kinds of formal arrangements may be interstate, intergovernmental, interministerial, interagency or between regional authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;Operational&amp;#x201D; means that an agreement for cooperation between the countries sharing transboundary basins meets all the following four criteria: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- There is a joint body or mechanism (e.g. a river basin organization) for transboundary cooperation;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- There are regular, i.e., at least annual, formal communications between riparian countries in form of meetings (either at the political and/or technical level);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- There is a joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or joint objectives have been set;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- There is a regular, i.e., at least annual, exchange of data and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concepts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monitoring has as its basis the spatial coverage of transboundary basins shared by each country, and focuses on monitoring whether these are covered by cooperation arrangements that are &amp;#x201C;operational&amp;#x201D;. The criteria to be met for the cooperation on a specific basin to be considered &amp;#x201C;operational&amp;#x201D; seek to capture whether the arrangement(s) provides the basic elements needed to allow that arrangement to implement cooperation in water management.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
