For aquifers, geological maps can provide a basis for approximating aquifer extent. In the case of groundwater, uncertainty about transboundary nature remains unless investigations of hydraulic properties have been made.

Missing surface water basin extent can be extracted from Digital Elevation Models available globally. Global geological maps and maps of hydrogeology/groundwater potential also exist which could be used to approximate aquifer extent (surface area).</p>\n<p>Concerning arrangements, consistency of information reported by countries sharing the same transboundary basins can be used to fill gaps in information about arrangements and their operationality.</p>"}
