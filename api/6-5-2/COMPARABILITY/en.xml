	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 6-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the computation of the indicator is based on the spatial information (&amp;#x201C;transboundary basin area&amp;#x201D;) and operationality of arrangements as the two basic components, differences can arise in the computation of each of these components individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding both components, countries have the most up-to-date information, which can be supplemented by the data from various international projects and inventories, which contribute also to establishing a baseline globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference on the value of transboundary basin area can arise from a different delineation of the transboundary water bodies, especially aquifers, or even the consideration of their transboundary nature as their identification and delineation can be based on different hydrogeological studies and can be updated, which is not necessarily reflected in international databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in the consideration of the operationality of the arrangements may arise from not identifying the same arrangements or considering differently the four criteria that serve as the basis for the operationality classification: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- existence of a joint body or mechanism for transboundary cooperation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- regularity of formal communication in form of meetings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- existence of joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or of joint objectives &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- regularity of the exchange of information and data &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A different interpretation in the object of application (only surface water or both surface water and groundwater) may constitute another reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collection of country input through validation mechanisms, has improved and will continute to improve, the consistency and accuracy of the information across the countries as the monitoring progresses.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
