	<message>The CLASS_SYSTEM field for indicator 5-2-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#x2018;gold standard&amp;#x2019; and operational definitions applied to the generation of the 2018 global, regional and national estimates for intimate partner violence against women (WHO, 2021) reference the UN Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women(UN, 2014) and the UNODC International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes ICCS (UNODC, 2015. These international standards on measurement and reporting include &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;standardized definitions of physical, sexual, and psychological IPV against women;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; measurement of these forms of violence using acts-based questions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Appropriate sample size &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;disaggregation by age groups&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;application of the appropriate denominator/target population (ever-partnered women)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reporting by type of perpetrator&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;comprehensive interviewer training to administer violence against women questions, and following internationally agreed ethical and safety guidelines, including on privacy, confidentiality and support service information. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Survey measurement, should be guided by these international standards and documentation should report on all of the above to allow for an overall assessment of data quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, to date, individual studies and surveys use different measures, methodologies and reporting standards. This makes it challenging to compare the prevalence across studies and requires the use of adjusted estimates for international comparability (see section 4b).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
