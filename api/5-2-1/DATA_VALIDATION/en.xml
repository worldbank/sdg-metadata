	<message>The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 5-2-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;A country consultation on the intimate partner violence (IPV) estimates was conducted in early 2020. All countries received their country profile which included their data sources, estimate, and a technical note explaining the methodology (available in six official languages). The consultations ensured: i) countries had the opportunity to review their nationally modeled IPV estimate and the data sources (surveys/studies) used in the production of these estimates, ii) the identification of any additional surveys/studies that met the inclusion criteria (i.e published between 2000-2018, used acts-based measures of IPV, nationally or subnationally representative) but which may not have been previously identified; and iii) familiarize countries with the statistical modeling approach used to derive the global, regional, and national estimates. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
