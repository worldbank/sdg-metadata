{"status":"success","message":"The ADJUSTMENT field for indicator 5-2-1, translated into en","data":"<p>There have been significant improvements in the measurement, availability, and quality of population-based survey data on intimate partner violence (IPV) globally. However, substantial heterogeneity remains in how national surveys and studies measure the different forms of intimate partner violence against women (VAW). For international comparability, data are statistically adjusted to ensure harmonization concerning: definitions (e.g. severity); age groupings (5 year age groups and aggregate 15 to 49 or 15 years and above), type of IPV (physical IPV only or sexual IPV only), the perpetrator of partner violence (spouse only or spouse/partner; current or most recent spouse/partner only or any current or previous spouse/partner), sample profile (ever-married/partnered women or currently-married/partnered women or all women) and geographical scope (national or sub-national, rural, urban). </p>"}
