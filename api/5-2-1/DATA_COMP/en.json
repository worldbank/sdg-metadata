{"status":"success","message":"The DATA_COMP field for indicator 5-2-1, translated into en","data":"<p>This indicator calls for breakdown by form of violence and by age group. Countries are encouraged to compute prevalence data for each form of violence as detailed below to assist comparability at the regional and global levels: </p>\n<p><u>1. Physical intimate partner violence: </u></p>\n<p>Number of ever-partnered women (aged 15 years and above) subjected to any act of physical violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) in the population multiplied by 100 .</p>\n<p><u>2. Sexual intimate partner violence: </u></p>\n<p>Number of ever-partnered women (aged 15 years and above) subjected to any act of sexual violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women (aged 15 years and above) in the population multiplied by 100. </p>\n<p><u>3.

Regional and global reporting on this indicator currently only includes data computed by countries for #4 above (i.e., <em>any form of physical and/or sexual partner violence)</em>, and for both the 15-49 and the 15 years and older age groups).
