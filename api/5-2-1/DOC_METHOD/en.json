{"status":"success","message":"The DOC_METHOD field for indicator 5-2-1, translated into en","data":"<p>Countries gather data on intimate partner violence (IPV) through (1) specialized national prevalence surveys dedicated to measuring violence against women (VAW), (2) VAW modules that are added to international/national household surveys, such as the DHS; and (3) crime victimization surveys.</p>\n<p>Although administrative data from health, police, courts, justice, and social services, among other services used by survivors of violence, can provide information on VAW, these do not provide prevalence data, but rather incidence data or service use (i.e., number of cases received in/who seek services). Many women who are subjected to abuse do not report or seek help for the violence and those who do, tend to be the most serious cases. Therefore, administrative data are not recommended as a data source for this indicator. </p>\n<p>For more information on recommended practices in the production of VAW statistics, see <em>UN Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys</em> (UN, 2014). The WHO with other co-custodians are finalizing a &#x201C;Quality checklist for surveys on IPV against women&#x201D; as a tool for strengthening country capacity in collecting and reporting high-quality data on violence against women.</p>"}
