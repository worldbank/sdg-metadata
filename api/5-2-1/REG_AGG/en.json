Regional aggregates are weighted averages of all the countries within the region. Weights used are the population of women aged 15 to 49 from the most recent 2019 revision of the World Population Prospects. Where data are not available for all countries in any given region, regional aggregates may still be calculated. The number of countries included in the average is indicated.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that regional and global figures should be interpreted with caution, as they do not necessarily represent with accuracy the region or world, especially for regions where population coverage is below 50 percent. </p>\n<p>Custodian agencies, in consultation with the Member States, have produced-to-date global, regional, and country estimates, enhancing the quality and accuracy of 5.2.1 reporting and addressing the comparability challenges outlined above. These new regional and global estimates (2018) are included in this round and form a baseline for the monitoring of progress. These are also available for World Bank, Global Burden of Disease and individual agency regions. </p>"}
