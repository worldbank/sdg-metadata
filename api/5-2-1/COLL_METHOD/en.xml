	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data are collated by the WHO on behalf of the Inter-Agency Working Group on Violence against Women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data come from publicly available survey data or data provided by National Statistics Offices (NSOs) or other relevant national entities through the consultation process with countries. For efficiency, some data are collated using existing data-compiling online platforms (e.g., DHS StatCompiler and the EU-wide Survey on Violence Against Women (Fundamental Rights Agency) Data Explorer)). &lt;/p&gt;</data>
