	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 5-2-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2000, 161 countries have conducted violence against women (VAW) national or subnational prevalence surveys or have included a module on VAW in a DHS or other national household surveys. However, not all these data are comparable and in many cases, they are not collected on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some countries (~77) have data on physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence for two or more time points. Global time series with comparable data are not yet available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to form of violence and age, income/wealth, education, ethnicity (including indigenous status), disability status, marital/partnership status, relationship with the perpetrator (i.e., current/former partner), geographic location, migration status, and frequency of violence are suggested as desired variables for disaggregation for this indicator. Though disaggregated data by these variables is not yet feasible to report on at regional and global levels, countries are encouraged to report these levels of disaggregation in their national reports; and&amp;#x2014;whenever possible&amp;#x2014;include these data for the age group 15 to 49.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
