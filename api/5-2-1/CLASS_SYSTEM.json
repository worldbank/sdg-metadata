These international standards on measurement and reporting include: comprehensive and standardized definitions of physical, sexual and psychological intimate partner violence against women, measurement of these forms of violence using acts-based questions, sample size, disaggregation by age groups, application of the appropriate denominator/target population (ever-partnered women), classification and reporting by type of perpetrator, comprehensive interviewer training to administer violence against women questions, and following internationally agreed ethical and safety guidelines, including on privacy, confidentiality and support service information. Survey documentation, therefore, should allow for the assessment of overall data quality.</p>\n<p>However, individual studies and surveys use different measures and methodologies, which makes it challenging to compare the prevalence of intimate partner violence across studies and requires the use of adjusted estimates for international comparability (see section 4b).</p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
