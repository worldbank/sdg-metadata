			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;There have been significant improvements in the measurement, availability and quality of population-based survey data on intimate partner violence globally, especially data on physical and sexual violence perpetrated by a husband or male intimate partner. However, there continues to remain substantial heterogeneity in how national surveys and studies measure these forms of violence against women. For international comparability, data are statistically adjusted to ensure harmonization in relation to definitions (e.g. severity); age groupings (5 year age groups and aggregate 15 to 49 or 15 years and above), type of intimate partner violence (physical intimate partner violence only or sexual intimate partner violence only), perpetrator of partner violence (spouse only or spouse/partner; current or most recent spouse/partner only or any current or previous spouse/partner), sample profile (ever-married/partnered women or currently-married/partnered women or all women) and geographical scope (national or sub-national, rural, urban). &lt;/p&gt;
