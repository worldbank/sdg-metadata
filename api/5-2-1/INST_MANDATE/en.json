It supports countries as they coordinate the efforts of multiple sectors of the government and partners to attain their health objectives and support their national health policies and strategies, including through developing norms and standards, and strengthening data collection, reporting, and use. The organization produces estimates and statistics for a wide range of diseases and health conditions including in its annual world health statistics report. It has led work on the measurement of violence against women since 1998, developed and tested new instruments for measuring VAW cross-culturally, as well as ethical and safety standards for research on VAW. </p>\n<p>In 2016, WHO Member States endorsed the <em>Global plan of action on strengthening the health system role in addressing violence, in particular against women and girls, and against children</em>(WHA Resolution 69.5) Improving the collection and use of data was one of its four strategic directions and included: a) Developing and disseminating harmonized indicators and measurement tools to support Member States in collecting standardized information on VAWG; b) Supporting Member States to implement population-based surveys on VAW; c) Building capacity in the collection, analysis and use of data; d) Regularly updating estimates of the prevalence of VAW.</p>\n<p><strong>UNICEF</strong> is responsible for global monitoring and reporting on the wellbeing of children. It provides technical and financial assistance to the Member States to support their efforts to collect quality data on violence against children, including through the UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) household survey program.

In the area of methodological work, the Division develops international statistical standards and methods essential for the compilation of reliable and comparable statistics and methodological guidelines for the collection, processing, analysis, and dissemination of data. the Division has unparalleled recognition around gender statistics. Over the past 4 decades, it has supported countries in their efforts to produce and use high quality and timely gender data for better evidence-based policymaking; developed and promoted standards and methodological guidelines addressing emerging issues of gender concern; produced the World&#x2019;s Women report every 5 years, and compiled gender statistics and facilitated access to data.

The agency collects and facilitates the gathering of the most accurate population data available to empower countries to make informed decisions on crucial development issues and humanitarian response. Its Population Data strategy addresses long-standing shortfalls in population data and related human capacity. The strategy seeks to expand the scope and quality of modern census and registry data, increase the use of geo-referenced population data to accelerate progress towards the SDGs, and advance the objectives of its mandate. The agency provides census technical support to more than 125 countries, through strong partnerships with governments, UN country teams, the US Census Bureau, and the population and data sectors worldwide. Census data provide the denominators for computation of many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and a basis for weights when calculating regional and global aggregates of various indicators, including SDGs. </p>"}
