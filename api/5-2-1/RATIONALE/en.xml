	<data>&lt;p&gt;Intimate partner violence is the most common form of violence that women face globally. Given prevailing social norms that sanction male dominance over women, male violence towards their female intimate partners is often perceived as an ordinary/normal element of relationships in the context of marriage or other unions. Violence against women is an extreme manifestation of gender inequality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prevalence data are required to measure the magnitude of the problem; understand the various forms of violence and their consequences; identify groups at high risk; and explore the barriers to seeking help in order to inform that the appropriate responses are being provided. These data are the starting point for informing laws, policies, and developing effective responses and programmes. They also allow countries to monitor change over time and optimally target resources to maximise the effectiveness of interventions (especially in resource-constrained setting).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
