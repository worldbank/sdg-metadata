	<data>&lt;p&gt;The guidelines recommend carrying out loss surveys every three to five years, with lighter surveys in between based on declarations, as loss ratios tend to be stable, from one year to the next under normal conditions. The recommendation is also to add a loss module to existing surveys. The data collection calendar will therefore follow the calendar of the main survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To establish a baseline, it is recommended to carry out two or three consecutive comprehensive PHL surveys to establish a first solid set of preliminary estimates. Since estimates limited to a single year have a higher risk of being biased because of the occurrence of specific events (e.g. that are weather-related), as compared to estimates based on two- or three-year averages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss estimates for the compiling Supply Utilization Accounts should be carried out every year.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
