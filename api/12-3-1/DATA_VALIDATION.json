{"status":"success","message":"The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 12-3-1, translated into all languages","data":{"ar":"","en":"<p>Data sources for agricultural production and on-farm losses are mainly national agricultural surveys that are conducted by the Ministry of Agricultural/Livestock and/or the National Statistical Office. The surveys are usually annual, and in the absence of direct measurements, data are interview-based. Agricultural censuses, which FAO recommends conducting every ten years, may be the only available source of loss estimates in a number of countries that do not carry out annual surveys. Off-farm loss data along the value chain may be obtained through specialized surveys (supplemented by research) through the national agri-food industry system.</p>\n<p>The data are provided in the Agriculture Production Questionnaire, in the Utilization sections used to compile Supply Utilization Accounts. </p>\n<p>Utilizations of interest here are those quantities destined for, among others, animal feed, for industrial uses (e.g. biofuel production), for national/enterprise/farm stocks, for seed (sowing for the successive agricultural cycle) &#x2013; to be able to infer on quality and economic losses, that are not covered by the definition and data collection, and to assess the overall data consistency in the validation phase.</p>\n<p>These datasets (production, trade and utilizations including losses), once cross-checked and validated, form the basis for the compilation of the Food Balance Sheets (FBS). The FBS are an accounting framework whereby supply (production + imports + stock withdrawals) should equal utilization (export + food processing + feed + seed + industrial use + losses, etc.). It should be noted that, within the FBS framework, post-harvest/slaughter losses (up to the retail level) are considered as utilization, and thus a component in the balancing of the FBS. The FBS framework provides a snapshot of the agricultural supply situation at the national level, and allows for a cross-referenced structure whereby data, official or estimated/imputed, may be further analyzed and validated (e.g. animal numbers may result as being under-reported/estimated). </p>\n<p>The new FBS Guidelines for national compilation (completed recently in collaboration with the Global Strategy) and new compilation tool (R-based &#x2018;shiny&#x2019; application).</p>\n<p>Detail on FBS methodology: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/fbs/ess-fbs02/en/\">http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/fbs/ess-fbs02/en/</a>. </p>\n<p>The FBS Handbook shown here should not be confused with the recently completed FBS Guidelines. The Handbook is of a more technical nature and explains the methodology followed by FAO in compiling country FBS. The Guidelines on the other hand, while based on the Handbook, provide countries with a more revised and practical guidance and recommendations for compilation at the national level. </p>\n<p>Some FBS background text also available on FAOSTAT: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS\">http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS</a>.</p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
