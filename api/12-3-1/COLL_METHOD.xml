			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The methodology and guidelines consider a range of data collection methods to reduce the cost of data collection. The emphasis is put on the critical loss points along the value chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidelines recommend representative sample surveys to ensure statistically representative, accurate, and comparable estimates especially when the sector is characterized by a large number of small actors (for example smallholders). Countries that already have a farm survey can add a post-harvest loss (PHL) module for the sake of cost-efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food loss data collection can be interview based (subjective approach) or measurement based (objective approach), the former method is less costly but leads to under-estimation. &lt;/p&gt;
