The surveys are usually annual, and in the absence of direct measurements, results are based on interview-based data on lost quantities of crop, animals and animal products. Agricultural censuses, which FAO recommends conducting every ten years, may be the only available source of loss estimates in a number of countries that do not carry out annual surveys. Off-farm loss data along the value chain may be obtained through specialized surveys (supplemented by research) through the national agri-food industry system. </p>\n<p>The Methodology for monitoring SDG Target 12.3 : <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/CA2640EN/ca2640en.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/3/CA2640EN/ca2640en.pdf</a> has been published as a guide for countries in calculating the index along with a method to aggregate data from subnational stages of the supply chain to the national level. Subnational disaggregation will identify where losses occur and the scope of impact, sets the focus on where to make investments and aids in targeting intervention strategies and policies to decrease food losses along the supply chains.</p>\n<p>The Guidelines for the measurement of harvest and post-harvest losses of grain produced by the Global Strategy are available at <a href=\"http://gsars.org/en/guidelines-on-the-measurement-of-harvest-and-post-harvest-losses/\">http://gsars.org/en/guidelines-on-the-measurement-of-harvest-and-post-harvest-losses/</a> with an on-line training course available at <a href=\"http://gsars.org/en/training-course-on-post-harvest-losses-english/#more-3855\">http://gsars.org/en/training-course-on-post-harvest-losses-english/#more-3855</a> .
