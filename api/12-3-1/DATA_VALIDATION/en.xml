	<message>The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 12-3-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data sources for agricultural production and on-farm losses are mainly national agricultural surveys that are conducted by the Ministry of Agricultural/Livestock and/or the National Statistical Office. The surveys are usually annual, and in the absence of direct measurements, data are interview-based. Agricultural censuses, which FAO recommends conducting every ten years, may be the only available source of loss estimates in a number of countries that do not carry out annual surveys. Off-farm loss data along the value chain may be obtained through specialized surveys (supplemented by research) through the national agri-food industry system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data are provided in the Agriculture Production Questionnaire, in the Utilization sections used to compile Supply Utilization Accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizations of interest here are those quantities destined for, among others, animal feed, for industrial uses (e.g. biofuel production), for national/enterprise/farm stocks, for seed (sowing for the successive agricultural cycle) &amp;#x2013; to be able to infer on quality and economic losses, that are not covered by the definition and data collection, and to assess the overall data consistency in the validation phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These datasets (production, trade and utilizations including losses), once cross-checked and validated, form the basis for the compilation of the Food Balance Sheets (FBS). The FBS are an accounting framework whereby supply (production + imports + stock withdrawals) should equal utilization (export + food processing + feed + seed + industrial use + losses, etc.). It should be noted that, within the FBS framework, post-harvest/slaughter losses (up to the retail level) are considered as utilization, and thus a component in the balancing of the FBS. The FBS framework provides a snapshot of the agricultural supply situation at the national level, and allows for a cross-referenced structure whereby data, official or estimated/imputed, may be further analyzed and validated (e.g. animal numbers may result as being under-reported/estimated). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new FBS Guidelines for national compilation (completed recently in collaboration with the Global Strategy) and new compilation tool (R-based &amp;#x2018;shiny&amp;#x2019; application).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detail on FBS methodology: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/fbs/ess-fbs02/en/&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/fbs/ess-fbs02/en/&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBS Handbook shown here should not be confused with the recently completed FBS Guidelines. The Handbook is of a more technical nature and explains the methodology followed by FAO in compiling country FBS. The Guidelines on the other hand, while based on the Handbook, provide countries with a more revised and practical guidance and recommendations for compilation at the national level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some FBS background text also available on FAOSTAT: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
