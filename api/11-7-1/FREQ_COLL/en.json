{"status":"success","message":"The FREQ_COLL field for indicator 11-7-1, translated into en","data":"<p>The monitoring of the indicator can be repeated at regular intervals of 3-5 years, allowing for three reporting points until the year 2030. However, annual updates to the existing database will be done and hence data releases based on annual updates will be available every year. Monitoring in 3-5-year intervals will allow cities to determine whether the shares of open public space in the built-up areas of cities are increasing significantly over time, as well as deriving the share of the global urban population living in cities where the open public space is below the acceptable minimum.</p>\n<p>UN-Habitat has developed a simple reporting template to collect city level data which will be sent to countries on an annual basis for reporting. This reporting template, which requests for information on the major components described in this metadata is expected to be used until 2030, but slight changes may be effected based as data on more aspects becomes available. The template is appended to this metadata and can also be accessed <a href=\"https://data.unhabitat.org/datasets/template-for-compilation-of-sdg-indicator-11-7-1\">HERE</a>.</p>"}
