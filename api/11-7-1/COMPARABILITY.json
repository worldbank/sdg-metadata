Cities can inventory the spectrum of spaces, from natural areas to small neighbourhood parks owned by different government entities. For example, in some cities, cemeteries are publicly available spaces run by the city park and recreation department. UN-Habitat has developed a basic methodological guide and tools, which have enabled national statistical agencies and cities to apply these methods in a standard way and compile a comparable inventory of open public spaces.</p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
