	<message>The REG_AGG field for indicator 5-2-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Global aggregates are weighted averages of all the sub-regions that make up the world. Regional aggregates are weighted averages of all the countries within the region. Where data are not available for all countries in a given region, regional aggregates may still be calculated if the minimum threshold for population coverage is met. The number of countries included in the average is clearly indicated.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
