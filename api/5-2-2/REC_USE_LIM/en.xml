	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 5-2-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Comparability:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The availability of comparable data remains a challenge in this area as many data collection efforts have relied on different survey methodologies and used different definitions of sexual violence and different survey question formulation. Diverse age groups are also often utilized. Willingness to discuss experiences of violence and understanding of relevant concepts may also differ according to the cultural context and this can affect reported prevalence levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts and investment will be required to develop an internationally-agreed standard and definition of sexual violence by non-partners that will enable comparison across countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Regularity of data production:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 1995, only some 40 countries have conducted more than one survey on violence against women and girls. Obtaining data on violence against women and girls is a costly and time-consuming exercise, no matter if they are obtained through stand-alone dedicated surveys or through modules inserted in other surveys. Not all VAW surveys, however, collect information on non-intimate partner violence. Monitoring this indicator with certain periodicity may be a challenge if sustained capacities are not built and financial resources are not available.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
