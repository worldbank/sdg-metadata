{"status":"success","message":"The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 5-2-2, translated into en","data":"<p>The main sources of intimate partner violence prevalence data are (1) specialized national surveys dedicated to measuring violence against women and (2) international household surveys that include a module on experiences of violence by women, such as the DHS.</p>\n<p>Although administrative data from health, police, courts, justice and social services, among other services used by survivors of violence, can provide information on violence against women and girls, these do not produce prevalence data, but rather incidence data or number of cases received in/reported to these services. We know that many abused women do not report violence and those who do, tend to be only the most serious cases. Therefore, administrative data should not be used as a data source for this indicator. </p>\n<p>For more information on recommended practices in production of violence against women statistics see: <em>UN Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys</em> (UN, 2014).</p>"}
