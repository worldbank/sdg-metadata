	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 5-6-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Indicator 5.6.2 measures exclusively the existence of laws and regulations and their barriers. It does not measure the implementation of such laws/regulations. In addition, the 13 components are intended to be indicative of sexual and reproductive health care, information, and education, instead of a complete or exhaustive list of the care, information, and education. These components were selected because they were identified as key parameters according to international consensus documents and human rights standards.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
