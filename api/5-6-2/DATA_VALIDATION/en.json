Indicator data and methodology are shared back with National governments together with the original submissions. Indicator 5.6.2 relies on official responses provided by National governments. UNFPA may follow up with national governments and request further information if the responses differ from country-specific information on legal and regulatory developments on issues about respective mandates of key stakeholders including UN Country teams and UN agencies. UNFPA also encourages each country to establish a national validation committee to review and validate all input from the Inquiry.</p>"}
