It shifted from an emphasis on meeting particular demographic targets to a focus on individual women&apos;s and men&apos;s needs, aspirations, and rights.. The PoA asserted that everyone counts, that the true focus of development policy must be the improvement of individual lives and the measure of progress should be the extent to which we address inequalities.
