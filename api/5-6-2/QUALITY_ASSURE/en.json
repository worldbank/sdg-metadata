{"status":"success","message":"The QUALITY_ASSURE field for indicator 5-6-2, translated into en","data":"<p>Indicator 5.6.2 relies on official responses provided by national governments. UNFPA performs quality checks and follows-up with national governments, requesting further information if the responses differ from country-specific information on legal and regulatory developments on issues about respective mandates of key stakeholders including UN Country teams and UN agencies, or if the responses are incomplete or differ from the government&#x2019;s responses to a previous Inquiry. UNFPA also encourages each country to establish a national validation committee to review and validate all input from the Inquiry.</p>"}
