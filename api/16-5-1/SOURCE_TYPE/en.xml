	<message>The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 16-5-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;This indicator is derived from household surveys on corruption experience and/or victimisation surveys with a module on bribery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator refers to individual (&amp;#x201C;direct&amp;#x201D;) experiences of the respondent, who is randomly selected among the household members, while (&amp;#x201C;indirect&amp;#x201D;) experiences of bribery by other members should not be included. However, direct bribery experiences of the respondent can include instances where the giving of money (in addition to an official fee), gifts or provision of a service is done through someone else (e.g. middlemen). Experience of bribery is collected through a series of questions on concrete contacts and experiences of bribery with a list of public official and civil servants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The denominator refers only to those persons that had at least one direct interaction with a public official/civil servant as they form the population group at risk of experiencing bribery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) collects data on the prevalence of bribery through its annual data collection: the UN Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (UN-CTS). The data collection through the UN-CTS is facilitated by a network of over 140 national Focal Points appointed by responsible authorities.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
