			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;This indicator is derived from household surveys on corruption experience and/or victimisation surveys with a module on bribery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator refers to individual experience of the respondent, who is randomly selected among the household members, while experience of bribery by other members is not to be included. Experience of bribery is collected through a series of questions on concrete contacts and experiences of bribery with a list of public official and civil servants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The denominator refers only to those persons that had at least one direct interaction with a public official/civil servant as they form the population group at risk of experiencing bribery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNODC collects data on the prevalence of bribery through its annual data collection (UN-CTS). The data collection through the UN-CTS is facilitated by a network of over 130 national Focal Points appointed by responsible authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
