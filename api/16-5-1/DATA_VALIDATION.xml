			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Following the submission of the CTS questionnaire, UNODC checks the submitted data for consistency and coherence with other data sources. For survey-based indicators, metadata are assessed in relation to the representativeness and coverage of the survey as well as alignment of question wording and answer options with international standards. Member States which are also part of the European Union or the European Free Trade Association, or candidate or potential candidate to the European Union are sending their response to the UN-CTS to Eurostat for validation. The Organization for American States is also reviewing the responses of its Member States. All data submitted by Member States through other means or taken from other sources are added to the dataset after review and validation by Member States.&lt;/p&gt;
