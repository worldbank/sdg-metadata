	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 16-5-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 120 countries have at least one data point on bribery prevalence based on a nationally representative survey. A growing number of countries are implementing surveys using similar methodologies in order to assess the prevalence of bribery experiences in the population. However, the scale and methods of administration of the surveys vary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator has recently been included into the annual United Nations Crime Trends Survey (UN-CTS, the regular data collection used by UNODC to collect data from UN Member States. It is expected that countries will gradually report on this indicator as the methodological guidance is disseminated and relevant items are included in national surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended disaggregation for this indicator are by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;age and sex of the bribe-givers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;type of official (police officer, health care worker, customs officer, etc.)ethe bribe-givers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;educational attainment of the bribe-givers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</data>
