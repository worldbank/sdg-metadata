{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 16-5-1, translated into en","data":"<p>Bribery prevalence in the SDG indicator framework is defined as the percentage of persons who paid at least one bribe (gave a public official money, a gift or counter favour) to a public official, <u>or were asked for a bribe by these public officials</u>, in the last 12 months, as a percentage of persons who had at least one contact with a public official in the same period.</p>\n<p>In this formulation, the share of the population in contact with public officials who was asked to pay a bribe (but did not give it) is to beincluded in the numerator of the indicator. However, several historical and on-going survey programmes implemented at the national and international level do not include experiences of bribery refusal in the formulation and prevalence computation. It is expected that data according to the preferred definition (which includes bribery refusal) will become increasingly available at national and global level, as standardised question wording and indicator computation are applied.</p>\n<p>On a more general level, it should be noted that this indicator provides information on the experiences of bribery occurring during interactions between citizens and the public sector, while it does not cover other forms of corruption, such as &#xB4;grand corruption&#xB4;, trading in influence, or abuse of power.</p>"}
