The validation process is led by country governments, in-line with existing standards and mechanisms. UN Women, as lead custodian, supports validation through review of questionnaire submission and direct follow up with government focal points. Further, qualitative data is requested to support validation of &amp;#x2018;yes&amp;#x2019; responses by a country. &lt;/p&gt;
