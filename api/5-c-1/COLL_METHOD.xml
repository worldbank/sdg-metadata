			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;It is envisaged that data collection will be undertaken as part of the country-level monitoring of effective development cooperation (SDG 17.16.1) where the Global Partnership monitoring framework provides a useful platform and mechanism. The Global Partnership monitoring is led by national coordinators appointed by their respective government to coordinate data collection and validation across relevant government ministries, departments and agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this indicator, the national coordinator will liaise with the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Women and other relevant ministries to complete the questionnaire. UN Women country office focal points will be available for support. With the GPEDC monitoring process generally launched early in the year, national coordinators will have until the end of the year to complete the data collection and validation at country level before submission to the JST for consolidation and analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
