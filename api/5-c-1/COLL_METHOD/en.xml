	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 5-c-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data collection is undertaken as part of the country-level monitoring of effective development cooperation where the Global Partnership monitoring framework provides a useful platform and mechanism. The Global Partnership monitoring is led by national coordinators appointed by their respective government to coordinate data collection and validation across relevant government ministries, departments, and agencies. Where countries are not reporting through the Global Partnership, efforts are made to expand country coverage by reaching out to national coordinators/focal points directly or through custodian/co-custodian country offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this indicator, the national coordinator/focal point will liaise with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Women, and other relevant ministries to complete the questionnaire. UN Women&amp;#x2019;s country office focal points will be available for support. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
