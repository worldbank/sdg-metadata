			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The indicator does not measure allocation of resources but the existence of mechanisms to track resource allocations and that make that information available publicly. However, there is an optional question in the questionnaire (not scored) that requests countries to report the percentage of the government budget allocated for gender equality programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the indicator, which is process oriented, does not provide data on the adequacy or quality of resource allocations.&lt;/p&gt;
