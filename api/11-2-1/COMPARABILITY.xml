&lt;p&gt;For this indicator, national data built up from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://unhabitat.org/national-sample-of-cities/&quot;&gt;&amp;#x201C;national sample of cities approach&amp;#x201D;,&lt;/a&gt; complemented with internationally available spatial data sources will be used to derive final estimates for reporting at national and global figures. As national agencies are responsible for data collection, no differences between country produced data and international estimated data on the indicator are expected to arise. Where such discrepancies exist, these will be resolved through planned technical meetings and capacity development workshops.&lt;/p&gt;
