They however also pointed out that this distance computation is not enough to properly measure &#x201C;convenient access&#x201D; to public transport. At a minimum, they recommended that additional features of quality be taken into account, as described in the recommended secondary indicators section. Eventually, a complete shift to a measure of access of destinations and opportunities would be ideal, if data systems can be developed to support this, and applied in a consistent manner in cities around the world. </p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
