	<message>The IMPUTATION field for indicator 11-2-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#x2022; At country level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022;&lt;strong&gt; At regional and global levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data and information gaps are anticipated in the first few years of collection of data for this indicator, and this will be largely as a result of the slow adoption of the proposed methodology by the national governments and statistical systems. The spatial nature of the indicator and the variations in the definitions of what is public transport by countries will all affect the availability of data. Hence missing data for selected countries will be scored incrementally based initially on whether an existing public transport system is in place or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If public transport is in place, then a modelled level of availability will be used to estimate a score instead of reporting zero for missing data. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
