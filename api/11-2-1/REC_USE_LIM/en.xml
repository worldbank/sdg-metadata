	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 11-2-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Experts in the transport sector, during different Expert Group Meetings held in 2016, 2017 and 2019 established that measuring accessibility to public transport using the distance to stop metric (spatial access of 500 m or 1 km walking distance to a public transport stop) provides a good measurement of the indicator. They however also pointed out that this distance computation is not enough to properly measure &amp;#x201C;convenient access&amp;#x201D; to public transport. At a minimum, they recommended that additional features of quality be taken into account, as described in the recommended secondary indicators section. Eventually, a complete shift to a measure of access of destinations and opportunities would be ideal, if data systems can be developed to support this, and applied in a consistent manner in cities around the world. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
