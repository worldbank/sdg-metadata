	<message>The FREQ_COLL field for indicator 11-2-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The monitoring of the indicator can be repeated at an annual interval, allowing several reporting points until the year 2030. Monitoring at annual intervals will allow to determining whether the proportion of the population with convenient public transport is increasing significantly over time, as well as monitor what is the share of the global urban population living in cities where the convenient access to public transport is below the acceptable minimum. Indicator 11.2.1has the potential to measure improvement within short term intervals. Moreover, the disaggregated monitoring for this indicator will provide increasing attention on the access to transport especially among the vulnerable populations such as women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons. It will also help to track a modal shift towards more sustainable modes of transport including public transport integrated with walking and cycling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UN-Habitat has developed simple reporting template appended to this metadata to collect city level data. The template, which will be send to countries on an annual basis is expected to be used until 2030, but slight changes may be effected as data on more aspects becomes available. The template is appended to this metadata and can also be accessed &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.unhabitat.org/datasets/template-for-compilation-of-sdg-indicator-11-2-1&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
