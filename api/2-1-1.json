It is expressed as a percentage. </p>\n<h2>Concepts: </h2>\n<p>Undernourishment is defined as the condition by which a person has access, on a regular basis, to amounts of food that are insufficient to provide the energy required for conducting a normal, healthy and active life, given his or her own dietary energy requirements. </p>\n<p>Though strictly related, &#x201C;undernourishment&#x201D; as defined here is different from the physical conditions of &#x201C;malnutrition&#x201D; and &#x201C;undernutrition&#x201D; as it refers to the condition of insufficient intake of food, rather than to the outcome in terms of nutritional status. In French, Spanish and Italian the difference is marked by the use of the terms alimentation, alimentaci&#xF3;n, or alimentazione, instead of nutrition, nutrici&#xF3;n or nutrizione, in the name of the indicator. A more appropriate expression in English that would render the precise meaning of the indicator might have been &#x201C;prevalence of under-feeding&#x201D; but by now the term &#x201C;undernourishment&#x201D; has long been associated with the indicator. </p>\n<p>While the undernourishment condition applies to individuals, due to conceptual and data-related considerations, the indicator can only be referred to a population, or group of individuals. The prevalence of undernourishment is thus an estimate of the percentage of individuals in a group that are in that condition, but it does not allow for the identification of which individuals in the group are, in fact, undernourished. </p><h1>Data sources </h1>\n<h2>Description: </h2>\n<p>The ideal source of data to estimate the PoU would be a carefully designed and skillfully conducted individual dietary intake survey, in which actual daily food consumption, together with heights and weights for each surveyed individual, are repeatedly measured on a sample that is representative of the target population. Due to their cost, however, such surveys are rare.</p>\n<p>In principle, a well-designed household survey that collects information on food acquisitions might be sufficient to inform a reliable estimate of the Prevalence of Undernourishment in a population, at a reasonable cost and with the necessary periodicity to inform the SDG monitoring process, provided that: </p>\n<p>a) All sources of food consumption for all members of the households are properly accounted for, including, in particular, food that is consumed away from home; </p>\n<p>b) Sufficient information is available to convert the data on food consumption or on food expenditures into their contribution to dietary energy intake; </p>\n<p>c) The proper methods to compute the PoU are used, to control for excess variability in the estimated levels of habitual food consumption across households, allowing for the presence on normal variability in the distribution of food consumption across individuals, induced by the differences in energy requirements of the members of the population. </p>\n<p>Examples of surveys that could be considered for this purpose include surveys conducted to compute economic statistics and conduct poverty assessments, such as Household Income and Expenditure Surveys, Household Budget Surveys and Living Standard Measurement Surveys. </p>\n<p>In practice, however, it is often impossible, and not advisable, to rely only on data collected through a household survey, as the information needed to estimate the four parameters of the PoU model is either missing or imprecise. </p>\n<p>Household Survey food consumption data often must be integrated by </p>\n<p>a) Data on the demographic structure of the population of interest by sex and age; </p>\n<p>b) Data or information on the median height of individuals in each sex and age class; </p>\n<p>c) Data on the distribution of physical activity levels in the population; </p>\n<p>d) Alternative data on the total amounts of food available for human consumption, to correct for biases in the estimate of the national average daily dietary energy consumption in the population. </p>\n<p>Data for a), b) and c) could be available through the same multipurpose survey that provides food consumption data, but are more likely available from other sources, such as National Demographic and Health Surveys (for a) and b) ) and Time Use Surveys (for c) ). </p>\n<p>Correcting for bias in the estimated average daily dietary energy consumption might need to be based on alternative sources on food consumption, such as aggregate food supply and utilization accounts and food balance sheets. </p>\n<p>To inform its estimate of PoU at national, regional and global level, in addition to all household surveys for which it is possible to obtain micro data on food consumption, FAO relies on: </p>\n<p>a) UN Population Division&#x2019;s World Population Prospects (<a href=\"https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/\">https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/</a>, which provide updated estimates of the structures of the national population by sex and age every two years for most countries in the world; </p>\n<p>b) FAO Food Balance Sheets (<a href=\"http://faostat3.fao.org/download/FB/*/E\">http://faostat3.fao.org/download/FB/*/E</a>), which provides updated estimates of the national availability of food every year for most countries in the world.</p>\n<p>Micro data from household surveys that collect food consumption data are sourced by FAO directly through the National Statistical Agencies&#x2019; websites, or through specific bilateral agreements.</p><h2>Collection process: </h2>\n<p>Official information on food commodity production, trade and utilization used by FAO to compile Food Balance Sheets is provided mainly by Statistical Units of the Ministry of Agriculture. FAO sends out a data collection questionnaire every year to an identified focal point. </p>\n<p>Microdata of household surveys are generally owned and provided by National Statistical Agencies. When available, data is sourced by FAO directly through the NSA&#x2019; website. In several cases, when microdata is not available in the public domain, bilateral agreements have been signed, usually in the contexts of technical assistance and capacity development programs. </p>\n<p>Data on the population size and structure for all monitored countries is obtained from the UN Population Division&#x2019;s World Population Prospects. </p><h1>Calendar </h1>\n<h2>Data collection: </h2>\n<p>Continuing </p><h2>Data release: </h2>\n<p>September 2019 </p><h1>Data providers </h1>\n<p>Given the various data sources, national data providers vary. Official information on food commodity production, trade and utilization used by FAO to compile Food Balance Sheets is provided mainly by Statistical Units of the Ministry of Agriculture. Microdata of household surveys are generally owned and provided by National Statistical Agencies. </p><h1>Data compilers </h1>\n<p>Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Statistics Division, Food Security and Nutrition Statistics Team </p><h2>Rationale: </h2>\n<p>The indicator has been used by FAO to monitor the World Food Summit Target and the MDG Target 1C, at national, regional and global level, since 1999. It allows monitoring trends in the extent of dietary energy inadequacy in a population over time, generated as a result of the combination of changes in the overall availability of food, in the households&#x2019; ability to access it, and in the socio-demographic characteristics of the population, as well as differences across countries and regions in any given moment in time. </p>\n<p>The parametric approach adopted by FAO allows obtaining reliable estimated for relatively large population groups. As it reflects a severe condition of lack of food, it is fully consistent with the spirit of a Goal that aims at reducing hunger. </p><h2>Comments and limitations: </h2>\n<p>Over the years, the parametric approach informing the computation of the PoU has been criticized, based on the presumptions that undernourishment should be assessed necessarily starting at the individual level, by comparing individual energy requirements with individual energy intakes. According to such view, the prevalence of undernourishment could be simply computed by counting the number of individuals in a representative sample of the population that is classified as undernourished, based on a comparison of individual habitual food consumption and requirements. Unfortunately, such approach is not feasible for two reasons: first, due to the cost of individual dietary intake surveys, individual food consumption is measured only in a few countries, every several years, on relatively small samples; moreover, individual energy requirements are practically unobservable with standard data collection methods (to the point that observed habitual energy consumption of individuals in a healthy status is still the preferred way to infer individual energy requirements). This means that even if it were possible to obtain accurate observations of the individual dietary energy consumption, this would be insufficient to infer on the undernourishment condition at individual level, unless integrated by the observation on the physical status (body mass index) and of its dynamic over time, of the same individual. </p>\n<p>The model based approach to estimate the PoU developed by FAO integrates information that is available with sufficient regularity from different sources for most countries in the world, in a theoretically consistent way, thus providing what is still one of the most reliable tools to monitor progress towards reducing global hunger. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Further specific consideration:</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Feasibility </em></p>\n<p>Estimation of PoU at national level has been feasible for most countries in the world since 1999. In the worst case scenario, when no data on food consumption was available from a recent household survey, the model-based estimate of the PoU is informed by an estimate of mean level of dietary energy consumption (DEC) from Food Balance Sheets (FBS), an indirect estimate of the coefficient of variation (CV) based on information on the country&#x2019;s GDP, Gini coefficient of Income, an index of the relative price of food, or other indicators of development such as country&#x2019;s Under 5 Mortality Rate, and an estimate of the Minimum Dietary Energy Requirement (MDER) based on the UN Population Division&#x2019;s World Population Prospects data. </p>\n<p><em>Reliability </em></p>\n<p>Reliability mostly depends on the quality of the data used to inform the estimation of the model&#x2019;s parameters. </p>\n<p>DEC could be estimated either from survey data or from food balances. Neither source is devoid of problems. When comparing estimates of national DEC from FBS and from surveys, differences are frequently noted. </p>\n<p>DEC estimates from survey data can be affected by systematic measurement errors due to under-reporting of food consumption, or to incomplete recording of all food consumption sources. Recent research shows that a negative bias of up to more than 850 kcal can be induced on the estimated daily per capita caloric consumption can be induced by the type of food consumption module chosen to capture the data at the household level. (See De Weerdt et al., 2015, Table 2, <a href=\"https://feb.kuleuven.be/drc/licos/publications/dp/DP%20365%20Complete.pdf%20\">https://feb.kuleuven.be/drc/licos/publications/dp/DP%20365%20Complete.pdf</a> ). A detailed analysis of a recent Household Budget Survey in Brazil revealed how food provided for free through the school meals program and consumed by children while at school, had not been accounted among the sources of household food consumption, accounting for a downward bias of the average per capita daily dietary energy consumption of 674 kcal. (See Borlizzi, Cafiero &amp; Del Grossi, forthcoming.) </p>\n<p>DEC estimates from Food Balance Sheets can also be affected by errors, though it is difficult to establish the direction of induced bias. As average food availability is a residual in the FBS method, any errors in reported production, trade, and stocks might affect the estimates of national food availability. Moreover, errors might be induced by the difficulty in properly accounting for all forms of food commodity utilization. To the extent that all these errors are uncorrelated, though, the impact on the estimated average food consumption will be lower than each of the errors, considered separately, might imply. Nevertheless, considering how problematic it is to precisely account for variations in national reserves of food commodities, for which official data may be unreliable, it is recognized that the estimated annual stock variation is prone to considerable uncertainty that would be transferred to the estimated DEC in each given year. </p>\n<p>To limit the impact of such errors, FAO has traditionally presented estimates of PoU at national level as three-year averages, on the presumption that errors induced by imprecise recording of stocks variations in each single year might be highly reduced when considering an average over three consecutive years. </p>\n<p>Survey data are the only source to estimate the CV and Skewness. As described in the section of metadata on the method of computation, unless obtained from high quality individual dietary intake surveys, data needs to be treated to reduce the likely upward bias in the estimates of the CV that would be induced by the spurious variability due to errors in measuring individual habitual dietary energy intake. </p>\n<p><em>Comparability </em></p>\n<p>If the same method of computation is used, comparability across time and space is relatively high, with the only potential cause of inhomogeneity found in the different quality of the background data. </p>\n<p><em>Limitations </em></p>\n<p>Due to the probabilistic nature of the inference and the margins of uncertainty associated with estimates of each of the parameters in the model, the precision of the PoU estimates is generally low. Even though it is not possible to compute theoretical Margins of Error (MoE) for PoU estimates, these would very likely exceed plus or minus 2.5% in most cases. For this reason, FAO publishes national level PoU estimates only when they are larger than 2.5%. This also suggests that 2.5% is the lowest feasible target that can be set for the PoU indicator, a value that is unsatisfactorily large when the ambition is to fully eradicate the scourge of hunger. </p>\n<p>If no survey is available that collects food consumption data and that is representative at subnational level, the indicator can only be computed at national level.</p><h1>Methodology </h1>\n<h2>Computation method: </h2>\n<p>The indicator is computed at the population level. To this aim, the population is represented by an &#x201C;average&#x201D; individual for which a probability distribution of the habitual daily dietary energy intake levels is modelled through a parametric probability density function (pdf). </p>\n<p>Once the pdf is characterized, the indicator is obtained as the cumulative probability that daily habitual dietary energy intakes (x) are below the lower bound of the range of normal dietary energy requirements for that representative, or average individual (MDER), as in the formula below: </p>\n<p>PoU= &#x222B;_(x&lt;MDER) f(x | DEC; CV; Skew) dx </p>\n<p>where DEC, CV and Skew are the mean, coefficient of variation and skewness that characterize the distribution of habitual dietary energy consumption levels in the population. </p>\n<p>Until 2012, the probability distribution f(x) was modelled as a Log-normal pdf, informed by only two parameters: mean and coefficient of variation. In its most recent formulation, it is modelled as a three-parameter pdf, able to represent different degrees of skewness, ranging from that of a symmetric Normal distribution to that of the positively skewed Log-normal distribution. The flexibility in capturing different degrees of skewness is needed to take into account the fact that human energy consumption levels are naturally bounded by physiological limits. It is thus conceivable that, as mean consumption levels increases, the skewness of the distribution decreases, gradually moving from (positively skewed) Log-normal distributions, typical of populations where average food consumption is relatively low, towards (symmetric) Normal distributions. The skew-normal and skew-lognormal families of distribution allow for the characterization of all possible intermediate degrees of positive skewness. (See <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e.pdf%20\">http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e.pdf</a> for a detailed description) </p>\n<p>A custom R function is available from the Statistics Division at FAO to compute the PoU, given the four parameters DEC, CV, Skew and MDER. </p>\n<p>Different data sources can be used to estimate the different parameters of the model. </p>\n<p><strong><em>DEC </em></strong></p>\n<p>The mean of the distribution of dietary energy consumption levels for the average individual in a population (DEC) corresponds, by definition, to the average, daily per capita food consumption level in the population. </p>\n<p>DEC can be estimated from data on food consumption obtained through surveys that are representative of the population of interest. Depending on the survey design, they can be used to estimate DEC at national and at sub national levels, either by geographic areas or by socio-economic population groups. Unfortunately, though the situation is rapidly improving, representative surveys that collect food consumption data are still not available for every country and every year. </p>\n<p>For the national population only, DEC can be estimated also from accounts of the total supply and utilization of all food commodities in a country, where the contribution of each commodity to the availability of food for human consumption is expressed in their dietary energy content, and their total is divided by the size of the population. The major source of data on national food balances are the Food Balance Sheets (FBS) maintained by FAO for most countries in the world (see <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/fbs/en/\">http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/fbs/en/</a>), informed by official data reported by member countries, and disseminated through FAOSTAT (<a href=\"http://faostat3.fao.org/download/FB/*/E\">http://faostat3.fao.org/download/FB/*/E</a>) </p>\n<p><strong><em>CV </em></strong></p>\n<p>Surveys that contain information on food consumption at individual or household level are the only available source to directly estimate the CV of habitual food consumption for the representative individual in the population. Unfortunately, survey data on food consumption are fraught by many problems that complicate the reliable estimation of CV. </p>\n<p>In principle, repeated observations of daily consumption for each individual in a sample would be needed to estimate levels of habitual consumption and to control for measurement errors. Moreover, data should be collected in different periods of the year on the same individuals or households to account for possible seasonal variation in levels of dietary energy consumption. Due to their cost, nationally representative individual dietary intake surveys with such characteristics are very rare, and virtually inexistent for most developing countries. As a consequence, the most common sources of data to estimate CV are multipurpose household surveys, such as Living Standard Measurement Surveys, Household Incomes and Expenditure Surveys (or Household Budgets Survey), that collect also information on food consumption. When using data collected at household level however, careful attention should be taken in distinguishing levels of food purchases or acquisitions from levels of actual utilization (consumption and wastage) during the identified reference period and in properly recording the number of individuals who participate in consumption; moreover, household level data will mask the variability due to intra-household allocation of food. </p>\n<p>For all these reasons, the coefficient of variation calculated on the series of average per capita daily dietary energy consumption levels recorded for each household included in a survey is never a reliable estimate of CV, which should reflect variability in the levels of habitual (and not occasional) daily dietary energy consumption level, at the individual (and not household) level. Empirical estimates of CV from household survey data are upward biased due to the spurious variability induced by measurement error, differences between occasional and habitual consumption, differences between acquisition and actual consumption and seasonality; moreover, they do not reflect the variability in dietary energy consumption in the population associated with individual characteristics of the household members (such as sex, age, body mass and physical activity levels). </p>\n<p>When using data collected through household surveys, CV is thus best estimated indirectly, controlling for spurious variability, and adjusted to reflect inter-individuals (in addition to inter-households) variability. The simplest way to proceed is to classify households into homogeneous groups and to calculate the coefficient of variation of the average per capita dietary energy consumption across household groups. This yields an estimate of the inter-households component of CV, labelled CV_H. An estimate of the inter-individuals component of the CV, labelled CV_I, is obtained, for each population, from its structure by sex, age and body masses, and the two components are combined to obtain the needed estimate as: </p>\n<p>CV^ = v[(CV_H)^2+(CV_I)^2 )]. </p>\n<p>For countries and years when no data from household survey are available, an indirect estimate of the CV, CV_IND, is obtained via a regression that projects the values of per capita GDP, Gini coefficient of income, and an index of the relative price of food (FPI) on the CV, while controlling for a regional shifter (REG). </p>\n<p>CV^_IND=&#xDF;_0+&#xDF;_1 GDP+ &#xDF;_2 GINI+ &#xDF;_3 FPI+&#xDF;_4 REG. </p>\n<p>Coefficients of the regression are estimated from the set of data and years for which data on CV, GDP, GINI and FPI are available. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Skew </em></strong></p>\n<p>As skewness is not strongly affected by the presence of spurious variability, Skew is estimated directly from household level data on the average daily dietary consumption, with the only exception of eliminating rare extremely high or extremely low values. If the empirically estimated skewness exceeds the value that would correspond to the skewness of Log-normal distribution with given mean and coefficient of variation, the parameter is neglected and a two parameter lognormal distribution is used for f(x). (See <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e.pdf</a> for additional details). </p>\n<p><strong><em>MDER </em></strong></p>\n<p>Human energy requirements are computed by multiplying normative requirements for basic metabolic rate (BMR, expressed per kg of body mass) by the ideal weight of a healthy person of given height, and then multiplied by a coefficient of physical activity level (PAL). Ranges of normal energy requirements are thus computed for each sex and age group of the population, observing that there exist a whole range of Body Mass Index (BMI) values &#x2013; from 18.5 to 25 &#x2013; that are compatible with health. This implies that any given attained height might correspond to a whole range of healthy body weights, and therefore to a range of values for energy requirement for BMR. </p>\n<p>Given information on the median height and the consideration that the group might contain individuals engaged in different levels of physical activity, the minimum, average and maximum dietary energy requirement can be computed for every sex and age class by taking into consideration special allowances for growth in individuals aged 0-21 and for pregnancy and lactation. </p>\n<p>(See <a href=\"ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/007/y5686e/y5686e00.pdf\">ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/007/y5686e/y5686e00.pdf</a> for further details). </p>\n<p>The MDER for a given population group, including for the national population, is obtained as the weighted average of the minimums of the energy requirements ranges of each sex and age class, using the population size in each class as weights. </p>\n<p>In computing the prevalence of dietary energy inadequacy in a population there has often been confusion between the concept of MDER and that of the Recommended Dietary Energy Intake, and regarding the appropriate threshold to be used to compute the probability of inadequacy. The reason why the probability of dietary energy inadequacy should be computed with reference to the MDER, and not the ADER (which, instead, can be used as an estimate of the average recommended dietary intake level for the whole population) is simply to recognize the fact that in any population there exists a certain range of normal variability in requirements; using the ADER as a threshold would greatly overestimate undernourishment as it would count also the proportion of the healthy population that consumes less than average, simply because of having less than average requirements. When needed, the ADER, or the average Recommended Dietary Energy Intake level in a population must be used instead to compute the dietary energy gap.</p><h2>Treatment of missing values: </h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>At country level: </li>\n</ul>\n<p>When no data on food consumption is available from a recent household survey, the model-based estimate of the PoU is informed by an estimate of DEC from Food Balance Sheets, an indirect estimate of CV based on information on the country&#x2019;s GDP, Gini coefficient of Income, an index of the relative price of food, or other indicators of development such as country&#x2019;s Under 5 Mortality Rate, and an estimate of the MDER based on the UN Population Division&#x2019;s World Population Prospects data. </p>\n<p>See the section on method of computation for details. </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>At regional and global levels: </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Missing values for individual countries are implicitly imputed to be equal to the population weighted average of the estimated values of the countries present in the same region. </p><h2>Regional aggregates: </h2>\n<p>Regional and global aggregates of the PoU are computed as: </p>\n<p>PoU_REG = (_i PoU_i &#xD7; N_i) / (_i N_i) </p>\n<p>where PoU_i are the values of PoU estimated for all countries in the regions for which available data allow to compute a reliable estimate, and N_i the corresponding population size. </p><h2>Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level: </h2>\n<p>The main three sources of data at national level are: </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Official reports on the production, trade and utilization of the major food crop and livestock productions. </li>\n  <li>Household survey data on food consumption </li>\n  <li>Demographic characteristics of the national population </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Data sources for agricultural production are usually national surveys that are conducted by the Ministry of Agricultural/Livestock and/or the National Statistical Office. The surveys are usually annual, and in the absence of direct measurements, use information on areas/animal numbers and crop yields/carcass weights to calculate crop or livestock product quantities. Agricultural censuses, which FAO recommends conducting every ten years, may complement these surveys by providing more updated measured data on crops and livestock, and thus enable more precise projections/revisions. </p>\n<p>The data source for agricultural and food trade is almost exclusively the national customs office (with few exceptions where data may be obtained from the Central Bank). Countries often prepare these trade reports following international standard formats (commodity/country classifications, units of measurement, trading partner detail). While such trade data may be considered quite reliable, being the result of direct measurement/reporting by/to the customs office, issues of unreported border trade (and animal movement), misclassification of commodities, confidentiality, time-lag, to name a few, may necessitate some data analysis and validation (often by referring to &#x2018; mirror&#x2019; trade statistics to cross-check quantities and values). </p>\n<p>Data on the utilization of primary and processed crops and livestock may be obtained through specialized surveys (supplemented by research) through the national agri-food industry system. Utilizations of interest here are those quantities destined for, among others, animal feed, for industrial uses (e.g. biofuel production), for national/enterprise/farm stocks, for seed (sowing for the successive agricultural cycle) &#x2013; to enable as accurate an assessment as possible of the quantities destined/available for potential human consumption. </p>\n<p>These datasets (production, trade and utilizations), once cross-checked and validated, form the basis for the compilation of the Food Balance Sheets (FBS). The FBS are an accounting framework whereby supply (production + imports + stock withdrawals) should equal utilization (export + food processing + feed + seed + industrial use, etc.). It should be noted that, within the FBS framework, post-harvest/slaughter losses (up to the retail level) are considered as utilization, and thus a component in the balancing of the FBS. The FBS framework provides a snapshot of the agricultural supply situation at the national level, and allows for a cross-referenced structure whereby data, official or estimated/imputed, may be further analyzed and validated (e.g. animal numbers may result as being under-reported/estimated). The main result of the compilation of the FBS is the calculation of the Dietary Energy Supply (DES) in kilocalories per person (based on population figures) in a given year (quantities resulting as available for human consumption are converted into their caloric equivalents by using appropriate nutritive conversion factors by commodity). The DES, in the absence of direct consumption data from household surveys, is one of the key components in the calculation of the Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU). FAO is presently embarking on a more focused program of providing FBS capacity to countries, including an updated compilation tool. </p>\n<p>FAO obtains crop/livestock primary/processed production data, and principal utilization thereof, through country-tailored questionnaires that are dispatched to all countries annually. Official country trade statistics are obtained annually through bulk downloads of the United Nations trade database (countries are expected to report to UNSD annually). In some cases, when available, national FBS data are also used. These datasets are then validated and form inputs in the country FBS which FAO compiles.

Given prevailing practice in the design of national household surveys, sufficient reliable information is seldom available for disaggregation beyond the level of macro area of residence (urban-rural) and of the main Provinces/Divisions in a country. To the extent that most of the used surveys are designed to accurately capture the distribution of income, inference can be drawn on the PoU in different income classes of the population. Gender disaggregation is limited by the possibility to identify and group households by gender-related information (such as sex of the head of the household, or male/female ratio). </p><h2>Sources of discrepancies: </h2>\n<p>Many countries have produced and reported on estimates of the Prevalence of Undernourishment, including in their national MDG Reports, but almost invariably using a different methodology than the one developed by FAO, which makes national figures not comparable to those reported by FAO for global monitoring. </p>\n<p>The most common approach used in preparing national reports has been to calculate the percentage of households for which the average per capita daily dietary energy consumption is found to be below thresholds based on daily Recommended Dietary Intake, usually set at 2,100.00 kcal, based on household survey data. In some cases, also lower thresholds of around 1,400.00 kcal have been used, probably as a reaction to the fact that percentages of households reporting average daily consumption of less than 2,100.00 kcal per capita were implausibly high estimates of the prevalence of undernourishment. </p>\n<p>Almost without exception, no consideration related to the presence of excess variability in the dietary energy consumption data is made, and the reports reveal limited or no progress in the reduction of PoU over time. </p>\n<p>As discussed in the section on the method of computation, the results obtained through these alternative methods are highly unreliable and almost certainly biased toward overestimation. It is therefore advisable that a concerted effort is made to advocate for use of the FAO methods also in preparation of national reports.

La prévalence de la sous-alimentation est donc une estimation du pourcentage d'individus d'un groupe qui sont dans cette situation, mais elle ne permet pas de déterminer quels individus du groupe sont effectivement sous-alimentés. </p><h1>Source(s) de données </h1>\n<h2>Description : </h2>\n<p>La source de données idéale pour estimer la prévalence de la sous-alimentation serait une enquête sur l'apport alimentaire individuel, soigneusement conçue et habilement menée, dans laquelle la consommation alimentaire quotidienne réelle, ainsi que la taille et le poids de chaque personne interrogée, sont mesurés de manière répétée sur un échantillon représentatif de la population cible. Toutefois, en raison de leur coût, ces enquêtes sont rares.</p>\n<p>En principe, une enquête auprès des ménages bien conçue et recueillant des informations sur les acquisitions alimentaires pourrait être suffisante pour fournir une estimation fiable de la prévalence de la sous-alimentation dans une population, à un coût raisonnable et avec la périodicité nécessaire pour éclairer le processus de suivi des ODD, à condition que : </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Toutes les sources de consommation alimentaire de tous les membres des ménages soient correctement comptabilisées, y compris les aliments consommés hors du domicile;</li>\n  <li>Des informations suffisantes soient disponibles pour convertir les données sur la consommation alimentaire ou sur les dépenses alimentaires en contribution à l'apport énergétique alimentaire; </li>\n<li>Les méthodes appropriées de calcul de la prévalence de la sous-alimentation soient utilisées pour contrôler la variabilité excessive des niveaux estimés de consommation alimentaire habituelle des ménages, en tenant compte de la variabilité normale de la distribution de la consommation alimentaire entre les individus, liée aux différences de besoins énergétiques des membres de la population. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Des exemples d'enquêtes qui pourraient être envisagées à cette fin comprennent les enquêtes menées pour calculer des statistiques économiques et effectuer des évaluations de la pauvreté, telles que les enquêtes sur les revenus et les dépenses des ménages, les enquêtes sur le budget des ménages et les enquêtes sur la mesure du niveau de vie. </p>\n<p>Dans la pratique, cependant, il est souvent impossible, et déconseillé, de se fier uniquement aux données collectées dans le cadre d'une enquête auprès des ménages, car les informations nécessaires pour estimer les quatre paramètres du modèle de prévalence de la sous-alimentation sont soit manquantes, soit imprécises. </p>\n<p>Les données sur la consommation alimentaire de l'enquête sur les ménages doivent souvent être supportées par des : </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>données sur la structure démographique de la population concernée par sexe et âge; </li>\n  <li>données ou informations sur la taille médiane des individus de chaque sexe et tranche d'âge; </li>\n  <li>données sur la distribution des niveaux d'activité physique dans la population; </li>\n  <li>données alternatives sur les quantités totales d'aliments disponibles pour la consommation humaine, afin de corriger les biais dans l'estimation de la consommation énergétique alimentaire quotidienne moyenne nationale de la population. </li>\n</ol>\n<p> Les données pour a), b) et c) pourraient être disponibles par le biais d'une même enquête polyvalente fournissant des données sur la consommation alimentaire, mais sont plus probablement disponibles auprès d'autres sources, telles que les enquêtes nationales sur la démographie et la santé (pour a) et b)) et les enquêtes sur l'emploi du temps (pour c)).</p>\n<p>La correction du biais dans l'estimation de la consommation énergétique alimentaire quotidienne moyenne pourrait devoir être basée sur d'autres sources de consommation alimentaire, telles que les comptes globaux d'approvisionnement et d'utilisation des aliments et les bilans alimentaires. </p>\n<p>Pour étayer son estimation des prévalences de la sous-alimentation aux niveaux national, régional et mondial,  en plus de toutes les enquêtes auprès des ménages pour lesquelles il est possible d'obtenir des microdonnées sur la consommation alimentaire, la FAO s'appuie sur : </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>UN Population Division&#x2019;s World Population Prospects (<a href=\"https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/\">https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/</a>), qui fournit des estimations actualisées des structures de la population nationale par sexe et âge tous les deux ans pour la plupart des pays du monde; </li>\n  <li>FAO Food Balance Sheets (<a href=\"http://faostat3.fao.org/download/FB/*/E\">http://faostat3.fao.org/download/FB/*/E</a>), qui fournit chaque année des estimations actualisées des disponibilités alimentaires nationales pour la plupart des pays du monde.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Les microdonnées provenant des enquêtes sur les ménages recueillant des données sur la consommation alimentaire sont fournies à la FAO directement par les bureaux nationaux de statistique (BNS), ou via leurs sites Internet ou des accords bilatéraux spécifiques.</p><h2>Processus de collecte : </h2>\n<p>Les informations officielles sur la production, le commerce et l'utilisation des denrées alimentaires utilisées par la FAO pour établir les bilans alimentaires sont principalement fournies par les unités statistiques des ministères de l'agriculture nationaux.

Il permet de suivre les tendances de l'ampleur de l'insuffisance énergétique alimentaire dans une population au fil du temps, générée par la combinaison des changements dans la disponibilité globale de la nourriture, dans la capacité des ménages d'y accéder, et dans les caractéristiques sociodémographiques de la population, ainsi que les différences entre les pays et les régions à un moment donné dans le temps.</p>\n<p>L'approche paramétrique adoptée par la FAO permet d'obtenir des estimations fiables pour des groupes de population relativement importants. Comme elle reflète une situation grave de manque de nourriture, elle est pleinement conforme à l'esprit d'un objectif visant à réduire la faim.</p><h2>Commentaires et limites : </h2>\n<p>Au fil des ans, l'approche paramétrique qui sous-tend le calcul de la prévalence de la sous-alimentation a été critiquée, car elle repose sur l'hypothèse que la sous-alimentation doit nécessairement être évaluée au niveau individuel, en comparant les besoins énergétiques individuels avec les apports énergétiques individuels. Selon ce point de vue, la prévalence de la sous-alimentation pourrait être simplement calculée en comptant le nombre d'individus dans un échantillon représentatif de la population classés comme sous-alimentés, sur la base d'une comparaison de la consommation alimentaire habituelle et des besoins individuels. Malheureusement, une telle approche n'est pas réalisable et ce pour deux raisons. Premièrement, en raison du coût des enquêtes sur les apports alimentaires individuels, la consommation alimentaire individuelle n'est mesurée que dans quelques pays, selon une périodicité pluriannuelle, sur des échantillons relativement petits. De plus, les besoins énergétiques individuels sont pratiquement inobservables avec les méthodes de collecte de données standards (à un tel point que la consommation énergétique habituelle observée des individus en bonne santé reste le moyen privilégié pour déduire les besoins énergétiques individuels). Cela signifie que même s'il était possible d'obtenir des observations précises de la consommation énergétique alimentaire individuelle, cela serait insuffisant pour déduire l'état de sous-alimentation au niveau individuel, à moins que le tout soit ajusté en fonction de l'état physique (indice de masse corporelle) et de la dynamique dans le temps d’un même individu.</p>\n<p>L'approche modélisée, développée et utilisée par la FAO pour estimer la prévalence de la sous-alimentation, intègre des variables disponibles régulièrement et ce pour la plupart des pays du monde. Le tout permet d’obtenir ce qui demeure l'un des outils les plus fiables pour suivre les progrès réalisés dans la réduction de la faim dans le monde.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Autres considérations spécifiques : </em></strong></p>\n<p><em> Faisabilité </em></p>\n<p>Depuis 1999, la plupart des pays du monde peuvent estimer la prévalence de la sous-alimentation au niveau national. Lorsqu'aucune donnée sur la consommation alimentaire n'est disponible à partir d'une enquête récente auprès des ménages, l'estimation de la prévalence de la sous-alimentation est basée sur un modèle incluant différentes variables : l’estimation du niveau moyen de la consommation énergétique alimentaire tirée des bilans alimentaires et l’estimation indirecte du coefficient de variation (CV) basée sur des informations sur le PIB national, le coefficient Gini du revenu, un indice du prix relatif des aliments, ou d'autres indicateurs de développement tels que le taux de mortalité des moins de 5 ans, ou une estimation des besoins énergétiques alimentaires minimums basés sur les données du World Population Prospects de la Division de la population des Nations unies.</p>\n<p><em>Fiabilité</em></p>\n<p>La fiabilité dépend principalement de la qualité des données utilisées pour l'estimation des paramètres du modèle. </p>\n<p>La consommation énergétique alimentaire peut être estimée soit à partir de données d'enquêtes, soit à partir de bilans alimentaires. Toutefois, aucune de ces sources n'est exempte de problème. Lorsque l'on compare les estimations tirées des consommations énergétiques alimentaires nationales provenant des bilans alimentaires à celles tirées des enquêtes, des différences sont fréquemment constatées. </p>\n<p>Les estimations de la consommation énergétique alimentaire à partir des données d'enquête peuvent être affectées par des erreurs de mesure systématiques dues à une sous-déclaration de la consommation alimentaire ou à un enregistrement incomplet de toutes les sources de consommation alimentaire. Des recherches récentes montrent qu'un biais négatif de plus de 850 kcal peut être introduit sur l'estimation de la consommation calorique quotidienne par habitant selon le type de module de consommation alimentaire choisi pour saisir les données au niveau des ménages. (Voir De Weerdt et al., 2015, tableau 2, <a href=\"https://feb.kuleuven.be/drc/licos/publications/dp/DP%20365%20Complete.pdf\">https://feb.kuleuven.be/drc/licos/publications/dp/DP%20365%20Complete.pdf</a>). Une analyse détaillée d'une récente enquête sur le budget des ménages au Brésil a révélé que les aliments fournis gratuitement dans le cadre du programme de repas scolaires et consommés par les enfants à l'école n'avaient pas été pris en compte parmi les sources de consommation alimentaire des ménages, ce qui explique un biais à la baisse de la consommation énergétique alimentaire quotidienne moyenne par habitant de 674 kcal. (Voir Borlizzi, Cafiero &amp; Del Grossi, à paraître). </p>\n<p>Les estimations de la consommation énergétique alimentaire provenant des bilans alimentaires peuvent également être affectées par des erreurs, bien qu'il soit difficile d'établir la direction du biais. Comme la disponibilité alimentaire moyenne est un résidu de la méthode du bilan financier, toute erreur dans la production, le commerce et les stocks déclarés peut affecter les estimations de la disponibilité alimentaire nationale. De plus, des erreurs peuvent être introduites par la difficulté de comptabiliser correctement toutes les formes d'utilisation des produits alimentaires. Dans la mesure où toutes ces erreurs ne sont pas corrélées, l'impact sur la consommation alimentaire moyenne estimée sera toutefois inférieur à ce que chacune des erreurs, considérée séparément, pourrait impliquer. Néanmoins, compte tenu de la difficulté de comptabiliser avec précision les variations des réserves nationales de denrées alimentaires, pour lesquelles les données officielles peuvent être peu fiables, il est admis que la variation annuelle estimée des stocks est sujette à une incertitude considérable qui est transférée à la consommation énergétique alimentaire estimée pour chaque année donnée.</p>\n<p>Pour limiter l'impact de ces erreurs, la FAO a toujours présenté les estimations de la prévalence de la sous-alimentation au niveau national en tant que moyennes sur trois ans, en partant du principe que les erreurs induites par un enregistrement imprécis des variations des stocks au cours d'une année donnée pourraient être fortement réduites si l'on considère une moyenne sur trois années consécutives.</p>\n<p>Les données d'enquête sont la seule source permettant d'estimer le CV et l'asymétrie. Tel que décrit dans la section des métadonnées sur la méthode de calcul, à moins d'être obtenues à partir d'enquêtes de haute qualité sur les apports alimentaires individuels, les données doivent être traitées de manière à réduire le biais à la hausse probable dans les estimations du CV qui serait introduit par la variabilité fausse due aux erreurs de mesure des apports énergétiques alimentaires individuels habituels.</p>\n<p><em> Comparabilité </em></p>\n<p>Si la même méthode de calcul est utilisée, la comparabilité dans le temps et l'espace est relativement élevée, la seule cause potentielle d'inhomogénéité se trouvant dans la qualité différente des données de base. </p>\n<p><em>Limites</em></p>\n<p>En raison de la nature probabiliste de l'inférence et des marges d'incertitude associées aux estimations de chacun des paramètres du modèle, la précision des estimations des prévalences de sous-alimentation est généralement faible. Même s'il n'est pas possible de calculer les marges d'erreur théoriques pour les estimations de la prévalence de la sous-alimentation, celles-ci dépasseraient très probablement plus ou moins 2,5 % dans la plupart des cas. C'est pourquoi la FAO ne publie des estimations de la prévalence de la sous-alimentation au niveau national que lorsqu'elles sont supérieures à 2,5 %. Cela suggère également que 2,5 % est l'objectif le plus bas qui puisse être fixé pour l'indicateur de la prévalence de la sous-alimentation, une valeur qui est trop élevée lorsque l'ambition est d'éradiquer complètement le fléau de la faim.</p>\n<p>Si aucune enquête recueillant des données sur la consommation alimentaire et représentative au niveau infranational n'est disponible, l'indicateur ne peut être calculé qu'au niveau national. </p><h1>Méthodologie  </h1>\n<h2> Méthode de calcul : </h2>\n<p> L'indicateur est calculé au niveau de la population. À cette fin, la population est représentée par une moyenne des &#x201C;individus&#x201D; pour lesquels une distribution de probabilité des niveaux d'apport énergétique alimentaire quotidien habituel est modélisée par une fonction de densité de probabilité paramétrique (DPP). </p>\n<p>Une fois la DPP caractérisée, l'indicateur est obtenu en calculant la probabilité cumulative que les apports énergétiques alimentaires habituels quotidiens (x) soient inférieurs à la limite inférieure de la fourchette des besoins énergétiques alimentaires normaux pour un individu représentatif ou moyen (MDER), comme dans la formule ci-dessous : </p>\n<p>PoU (prévalence de la sous-alimentation) = &#x222B;_(x&lt;MDER) f(x | DEC ; CV ; Skew) dx </p>\n<p>où DEC (consommation énergétique alimentaire), CV et Skew sont la moyenne, le coefficient de variation et l'asymétrie qui caractérisent la distribution des niveaux de consommation énergétique alimentaire habituelle dans la population. </p>\n<p>Jusqu'en 2012, la distribution de probabilité f(x) était modélisée comme une DPP log-normale, incluant seulement deux paramètres : la moyenne et le coefficient de variation. Dans sa formulation la plus récente, elle inclut trois paramètres, capable de représenter différents degrés d'asymétrie, allant de celle d'une distribution normale symétrique à celle d'une distribution log-normale positivement asymétrique. La flexibilité dans la saisie des différents degrés d'asymétrie est nécessaire pour tenir compte du fait que les niveaux de consommation d'énergie humaine sont naturellement limités par des limites physiologiques. Il est donc concevable que, lorsque les niveaux de consommation moyens augmentent, l'asymétrie de la distribution diminue, passant progressivement de distributions log-normales (positivement asymétriques), typiques des populations où la consommation alimentaire moyenne est relativement faible, à des distributions normales (symétriques). Les familles de distribution skew-normale et skew-lognale permettent de caractériser tous les degrés intermédiaires possibles d'asymétrie positive. (Voir <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e.pdf%20\">http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e.pdf</a> pour une description détaillée) </p>\n<p>Une fonction R est disponible auprès de la Division des statistiques de la FAO pour calculer la prévalence de la sous-alimentation, compte tenu des paramètres DEC, CV, Skew et MDER.</p>\n<p>Différentes sources de données peuvent être utilisées pour estimer les différents paramètres du modèle. </p>\n<p><strong><em>DEC </em></strong></p>\n<p>La moyenne de la distribution des niveaux de consommation énergétique alimentaire (DEC) pour l'individu moyen d'une population correspond, par définition, au niveau moyen de consommation alimentaire quotidien par habitant dans la population.</p>\n<p>La DEC peut être estimée à partir de données sur la consommation alimentaire obtenues par des enquêtes représentatives de la population concernée. Selon la conception de l'enquête, elles peuvent être utilisées pour estimer la DEC au niveau national et sous-national, soit par zones géographiques, soit par groupes socio-économiques de la population. Malheureusement, bien que la situation s'améliore rapidement, les enquêtes représentatives qui recueillent des données sur la consommation alimentaire ne sont toujours pas disponibles pour chaque pays et chaque année.</p>\n<p>Pour la population nationale uniquement, la DEC peut également être estimée à partir des comptes de l'offre totale et de l'utilisation de tous les produits alimentaires dans un pays, où la contribution de chaque produit à la disponibilité des aliments pour la consommation humaine est exprimée en fonction de son contenu énergétique alimentaire. Le total est divisé par la taille de la population afin d’obtenir une moyenne par habitant. La principale source de données pour les bilans alimentaires nationaux est la Food Balance Sheets (FBS), compilée par la FAO pour la plupart des pays du monde (voir <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/bilans-alimentaires/fr/\">http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/bilans-alimentaires/fr/</a>), Bilans alimentaires</a>), alimenté par les données officielles communiquées par les pays membres et diffusé par FAOSTAT (<a href=\"http://faostat3.fao.org/download/FB/*/E\">http://faostat3.fao.org/download/FB/*/E</a>) </p>\n<p><strong><em>CV </em></strong></p>\n<p>Les enquêtes contenant des informations sur la consommation alimentaire au niveau des individus ou des ménages constituent la seule source disponible pour estimer directement le CV de la consommation alimentaire habituelle de l'individu représentatif dans la population. Malheureusement, les données d'enquête sur la consommation alimentaire se heurtent à de nombreux problèmes qui compliquent l'estimation fiable du CV.</p>\n<p>En principe, des observations répétées de la consommation quotidienne de chaque individu d'un échantillon seraient nécessaires pour estimer les niveaux de consommation habituelle et pour contrôler les erreurs de mesure. De plus, les données devraient être recueillies à différentes périodes de l'année pour les mêmes individus ou ménages afin de tenir compte d'éventuelles variations saisonnières des niveaux de consommation d'énergie alimentaire. En raison de leur coût, les enquêtes individuelles représentatives au niveau national sur la consommation alimentaire présentant de telles caractéristiques sont très rares, et pratiquement inexistantes pour la plupart des pays en développement. Par conséquent, les sources de données les plus courantes pour estimer le CV sont les enquêtes polyvalentes sur les ménages, telles que les enquêtes de mesure du niveau de vie, les enquêtes sur les revenus et les dépenses des ménages (ou enquête sur les budgets des ménages), qui recueillent également des informations sur la consommation alimentaire. Toutefois, lors de l'utilisation des données recueillies au niveau des ménages, il convient de veiller à distinguer les niveaux d'achat ou d'acquisition de denrées alimentaires des niveaux d'utilisation réelle (consommation et gaspillage) au cours de la période de référence identifiée et à enregistrer correctement le nombre de personnes participant à la consommation. Enfin, les données au niveau des ménages masquent la variabilité due à la répartition des denrées alimentaires au sein des ménages.</p>\n<p>Pour toutes ces raisons, le CV calculé sur la série des niveaux moyens de consommation énergétique alimentaire quotidienne par habitant enregistrés pour chaque ménage inclus dans une enquête n'est jamais une estimation fiable du CV, qui devrait refléter la variabilité des niveaux de consommation énergétique alimentaire quotidienne habituelle (et non occasionnelle), au niveau de l'individu (et non du ménage). Les estimations empiriques du CV à partir des données des enquêtes sur les ménages sont biaisées à la hausse en raison de la variabilité fausse introduite par l'erreur de mesure, des différences entre la consommation occasionnelle et habituelle, des différences entre l'acquisition et la consommation réelle et de la saisonnalité. De plus, elles ne reflètent pas la variabilité de la consommation d'énergie alimentaire dans la population associée aux caractéristiques individuelles des membres du ménage (telles que le sexe, l'âge, la masse corporelle et le niveau d'activité physique).</p>\n<p>Lorsque l'on utilise des données recueillies dans le cadre d'enquêtes auprès des ménages, la meilleure estimation du CV est donc indirecte, en tenant compte de la variabilité erronée, et ajustée pour refléter la variabilité interindividuelle (en plus de la variabilité inter-ménages). La façon la plus simple de procéder consiste à classer les ménages en groupes homogènes et à calculer le coefficient de variation de la consommation moyenne d'énergie alimentaire par habitant dans les différents groupes de ménages. On obtient ainsi une estimation de la composante inter-ménages du CV, appelée CV_H. Une estimation de la composante interindividuelle du CV, appelée CV_I, est obtenue, pour chaque population, à partir de sa structure par sexe, âge et masse corporelle, et les deux composantes sont combinées pour obtenir l'estimation nécessaire :</p>\n<p>CV^ = v[(CV_H)^2+(CV_I)^2 )]. </p>\n<p>Pour les pays et les années où aucune donnée provenant de l'enquête sur les ménages n'est disponible, une estimation indirecte du CV, CV_IND, est obtenue par une régression projetant les valeurs du PIB par habitant, du coefficient Gini du revenu et d'un indice du prix relatif des denrées alimentaires (FPI) sur le CV, tout en tenant compte d'un changement de région (REG).</p>\n<p>CV^_IND=&#xDF;_0+&#xDF;_1 PIB+ &#xDF;_2 GINI+ &#xDF;_3 FPI+&#xDF;_4 REG. </p>\n<p>Les coefficients de la régression sont estimés à partir de l'ensemble des données et des années pour lesquelles des données sur le CV, le PIB, le coefficient GINI et le FPI sont disponibles.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Asymétrie </em></strong></p>\n<p>Comme l'asymétrie n'est pas fortement affectée par la présence d'une fausse variabilité, l'asymétrie est estimée directement à partir des données des ménages sur la consommation alimentaire quotidienne moyenne, à la seule exception de l'élimination des rares valeurs extrêmement élevées ou extrêmement faibles. Si l'asymétrie estimée dépasse la valeur qui correspondrait à l'asymétrie de la distribution log-normale avec une moyenne et un coefficient de variation donnés, le paramètre est négligé et une distribution log-normale à deux paramètres est utilisée pour f(x). (Voir <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e.pdf</a> pour plus de détails). </p>\n<p><strong><em>MDER </em></strong></p>\n<p>Les besoins énergétiques humains sont calculés en multipliant les exigences normatives du taux métabolique de base (BMR, exprimé par kg de masse corporelle) par le poids idéal d'une personne en bonne santé de taille donnée, puis en le multipliant par un coefficient de niveau d'activité physique (PAL). Des fourchettes de besoins énergétiques normaux sont ainsi calculées pour chaque sexe et chaque groupe d'âge de la population, en retenant qu'il existe toute une gamme de valeurs de l'indice de masse corporelle (IMC) &#x2013; allant de 18,5 à 25 &#x2013; qui sont compatibles avec la santé. Cela implique que toute taille atteinte peut correspondre à toute une gamme de poids corporels sains, et donc à une gamme de valeurs de besoins énergétiques.</p>\n<p>Compte tenu des informations sur la taille médiane et du fait que le groupe peut comprendre des individus pratiquant différents niveaux d'activité physique, les besoins énergétiques alimentaires minimums, moyens et maximums peuvent être calculés pour chaque sexe et chaque classe d'âge en tenant compte des allocations spéciales pour la croissance des individus âgés de 0 à 21 ans, ainsi que pour la grossesse et l'allaitement. </p>\n<p>(Pour plus de détails, il est possible de consulter <a href=\"ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/007/y5686e/y5686e00.pdf\">ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/007/y5686e/y5686e00.pdf</a>). </p>\n<p>Le MDER pour un groupe de population donné, y compris pour la population nationale, est obtenu comme la moyenne pondérée des minimums des fourchettes de besoins énergétiques de chaque sexe et de chaque classe d'âge, en utilisant la taille de la population dans chaque classe comme poids. </p>\n<p>Lors du calcul de la prévalence de l'insuffisance énergétique alimentaire dans une population, il y a souvent eu confusion entre le concept de MDER et celui d'apport énergétique alimentaire recommandé, et concernant le seuil approprié à utiliser pour calculer la probabilité d'insuffisance. La raison pour laquelle la probabilité d'un apport énergétique insuffisant doit être calculée par rapport à la MDER, et non à l'apport énergétique alimentaire recommandé (qui, au contraire, peut être utilisé comme une estimation de l'apport alimentaire moyen recommandé pour l'ensemble de la population) est simplement de reconnaître le fait que dans toute population, il existe une certaine plage de variabilité normale des besoins. Ainsi, utiliser l'apport énergétique alimentaire recommandé comme seuil reviendrait à surestimer considérablement la sous-alimentation, car cela permettrait également de compter la proportion de la population en bonne santé qui consomme moins que la moyenne, simplement parce qu'elle a des besoins inférieurs à la moyenne. Néanmoins, en cas de besoin, l'apport énergétique alimentaire recommandé, ou le niveau moyen d'apport énergétique alimentaire recommandé dans une population, peut être utilisé pour calculer l'écart énergétique alimentaire.</p><h2>Traitement des valeurs manquantes : </h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Au niveau national : </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lorsqu'aucune donnée sur la consommation alimentaire n'est disponible à partir d'une enquête récente auprès des ménages, l'estimation de la prévalence de la sous-alimentation est basée sur un modèle incluant différentes variables : l’estimation du niveau moyen de la consommation énergétique alimentaire tirée des bilans alimentaires et l’estimation indirecte du coefficient de variation (CV) basée sur des informations sur le PIB national, le coefficient Gini du revenu, un indice du prix relatif des aliments, ou d'autres indicateurs de développement tels que le taux de mortalité des moins de 5 ans, ou une estimation des besoins énergétiques alimentaires minimums basés sur les données du World Population Prospects de la Division de la population des Nations unies.</p>\n<p>Voir la section Méthode de calcul pour plus de détails.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Aux niveaux régional et mondial : </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Les valeurs manquantes pour chaque pays sont implicitement imputées pour être égales à la moyenne pondérée de la population des valeurs estimées des pays présents dans la même région. </p><h2>Agrégats régionaux : </h2>\n<p>Les agrégats régionaux et mondiaux de la prévalence de la sous-alimentation (PoU) sont calculés comme suit :</p>\n<p>PoU_REG = (_i PoU_i &#xD7; N_i) / (_i N_i) </p>\n<p>où PoU_i correspond aux valeurs de la prévalence de la sous-alimentation estimées pour tous les pays dans les régions pour lesquelles les données disponibles permettent de calculer une estimation fiable, et N_i correspond à la taille de la population correspondante.</p><h2>Méthodes et instructions à la disposition des pays pour la compilation des données au niveau national : </h2>\n<p> Les trois principales sources de données au niveau national sont : </p>\n<ol>\n  <li> Les rapports officiels sur la production, le commerce et l'utilisation des principales cultures vivrières et les élevages.</li>\n  <li> Les données d'enquêtes auprès des ménages sur la consommation alimentaire.</li>\n  <li> Les caractéristiques démographiques de la population nationale.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Les sources de données sur la production agricole sont généralement des enquêtes nationales menées par le Ministère de l'agriculture (et de l'élevage) et/ou par le bureau national de statistique. Les enquêtes sont généralement annuelles et, en l'absence de mesures directes, utilisent des informations sur les superficies, le nombre d'animaux, les rendements des cultures et/ou le poids des carcasses pour calculer les quantités de produits au chapitre des cultures ou du bétail. Les recensements agricoles, que la FAO recommande de mener à tous les dix ans, peuvent compléter ces enquêtes en fournissant des données plus récentes sur les cultures et le bétail, et ainsi permettre des projections/révisions plus précises.</p>\n<p> La source de données pour le commerce agricole et alimentaire est presque toujours le bureau national des douanes (à quelques exceptions près où les données peuvent être obtenues auprès de la Banque centrale). Les pays préparent souvent ces rapports commerciaux selon des formats normalisés internationaux (classifications des produits/pays, unités de mesure, détail des partenaires commerciaux). Bien que ces données commerciales puissent être considérées comme assez fiables, étant le résultat de mesures/déclarations directes par/au bureau de douane, des problèmes de commerce frontalier non déclaré (et de mouvement des animaux), de classification erronée des produits, de confidentialité, de décalage, pour n'en nommer que quelques-uns, peuvent nécessiter une analyse et une validation des données (souvent en se référant aux statistiques commerciales &#x2018;miroir&#x2019; pour vérifier les quantités et les valeurs). </p>\n<p>Les données sur l'utilisation primaire et transformée des cultures et du bétail, peuvent être obtenues par le biais d'enquêtes spécialisées (complétées par des recherches) auprès de l'industrie agroalimentaire nationale. Les utilisations qui nous intéressent ici sont les quantités destinées, entre autres, à l'alimentation animale, à des usages industriels (par exemple la production de biocarburants), aux stocks nationaux/d'entreprises/agricoles, aux semences (semis pour le cycle agricole successif) – pour permettre une évaluation aussi précise que possible des quantités destinées et/ou disponibles à la consommation humaine potentielle.</p>\n<p> Ces ensembles de données (production, commerce et utilisations), une fois recoupés et validés, constituent la base de la compilation des bilans alimentaires. Les bilans alimentaires constituent un cadre comptable dans lequel l'offre (production + importations + retraits de stocks) doit être égale à l'utilisation (exportation + transformation alimentaire + aliments + semences + utilisation industrielle, etc.). Il convient de noter que, dans le cadre des bilans alimentaires, les pertes après récolte/abattage (jusqu'au niveau de détail) sont considérées comme une utilisation, et donc une composante de l'équilibrage du bilan. Le cadre des bilans alimentaires fournit un portrait de la situation de l'offre agricole au niveau national et une structure de références croisées par laquelle les données, officielles ou estimées/imputées, peuvent être davantage analysées et validées (par exemple, le nombre d'animaux peut être sous-déclaré/estimé). Le principal résultat de la compilation du bilan alimentaire est le calcul de l'offre énergétique alimentaire (DES) en kilocalories par personne (sur la base des chiffres de la population) au cours d'une année donnée (les quantités résultant de la disponibilité pour la consommation humaine sont converties en leurs équivalents caloriques en utilisant facteurs de conversion nutritifs appropriés par produit). En l'absence de données directes sur la consommation provenant des enquêtes auprès des ménages, la DES constitue l'un des éléments clés du calcul de la prévalence de la sous-alimentation. La FAO travaille actuellement à la mise en place d'un programme plus ciblé visant à fournir de l’appui aux pays pour l’établissement de bilans alimentaires, comprenant un outil de compilation mis à jour.</p>\n<p>La FAO obtient des données sur la production primaire/transformée des cultures/du bétail, et leur utilisation principale, par le biais de questionnaires adaptés qui sont envoyés à tous les pays et ce à chaque année. Les statistiques officielles du commerce avec les pays sont obtenues chaque année grâce à des téléchargements en masse de la base de données sur le commerce des Nations unies (les pays doivent faire rapport annuellement à la DSNU). Dans certains cas, lorsqu'elles sont disponibles, les données des bilans alimentaires nationaux sont également utilisées. Ces ensembles de données sont ensuite validés et constituent des entrées dans le bilan alimentaire du pays que la FAO compile. Il convient de noter que lorsque les données ne sont pas officiellement déclarées/disponibles (comme c'est souvent le cas avec les données d'utilisation des produits), il est nécessaire de recourir à des imputations pour combler les lacunes dans les données.</p>\n<p>Les nouvelles directives pour la compilation des bilans alimentaires nationaux (achevées récemment en collaboration avec la Stratégie mondiale) et le nouvel outil de compilation (application R shiny) sont maintenant disponibles.</p>\n<p> <strong> <em>Détails sur la méthodologie des bilans alimentaires :</em> </strong> <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/fbs/ess-fbs02/fr/\"> http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/fbs/ess-fbs02/fr/ </a>. </p>\n<p>Le manuel présenté ici ne doit pas être confondu avec les directives récemment complétées.

Compte tenu de la pratique courante dans la conception des enquêtes nationales auprès des ménages, il est rare que des informations fiables suffisantes soient disponibles pour une désagrégation au-delà du niveau de la macro-zone de résidence (urbaine-rurale) et des principales provinces/divisions d'un pays. Dans la mesure où la plupart des enquêtes utilisées sont conçues pour capturer avec précision la distribution des revenus, l'inférence peut être tirée sur la prévalence de la sous-alimentation dans différentes catégories de revenus de la population. La désagrégation par sexe est limitée par la possibilité d'identifier et de regrouper les ménages en fonction des informations liées au genre (comme le sexe du chef de ménage ou le ratio hommes/femmes). </p><h2> Sources de divergences : </h2>\n<p>De nombreux pays ont produit et diffusé des estimations de la prévalence de la sous-alimentation, y compris dans leurs rapports nationaux sur les OMD, mais en utilisant presque toujours une méthodologie différente de celle élaborée par la FAO, ce qui rend les chiffres nationaux non comparables à ceux communiqués par la FAO.</p>\n<p> L'approche la plus couramment utilisée dans la préparation des rapports nationaux a été de calculer le pourcentage de ménages pour lesquels la consommation énergétique alimentaire quotidienne moyenne par habitant est inférieure aux seuils de l'apport alimentaire quotidien recommandé, généralement fixé à 2 100,00 kcal, basé sur les données d'enquêtes auprès des ménages. Dans certains cas, des seuils inférieurs d'environ 1 400,00 kcal ont également été utilisés, probablement en réaction au fait que les pourcentages de ménages déclarant une consommation quotidienne moyenne inférieure à 2 100,00 kcal par habitant donnaient des estimations invraisemblablement élevées de la prévalence de la sous-alimentation. </p>\n<p> Presque sans exception, aucune considération liée à la présence d'une variabilité excessive dans les données de consommation énergétique alimentaire n'est faite, et les rapports révèlent des progrès limités ou nuls dans la réduction de la prévalence de la sous-alimentation au fil du temps. </p>\n<p>Tel qu’indiqué dans la section Méthode de calcul, les résultats obtenus grâce à ces méthodes alternatives sont très peu fiables et très certainement biaisés en faveur d'une surestimation. Il est donc souhaitable qu'un effort concerté soit fait pour plaider en faveur de l'utilisation des méthodes de la FAO dans la préparation des rapports nationaux.

Данная оценка выражается в процентах. </p>\n<h2>Понятия: </h2>\n<p> Недоедание определяется как состояние, при котором человек имеет регулярный доступ к количеству еды, которого недостаточно, чтобы обеспечить его энергией, необходимой для ведения нормального, активного и здорового образа жизни, учитывая необходимую для него или нее калорийность питания. </p>\n<p>Хотя, строго говоря, \"недоедание\", как здесь определено, отличается от физических состояний \"плохое питание\" и \"недостаточное питание\", поскольку оно относится к состоянию недостаточного потребления пищи, а не к результату с точки зрения уровня питания. На французском, испанском и итальянском языках разница отражается в использовании в названии показателя терминов alimentation, alimentacin или alimentazione вместо nutrition, nutricin или nutrizione. Более подходящим выражением на английском языке, которое бы отображало точное значение показателя, могло бы быть \"prevalence of under-feeding\" (распространенность недостаточного потребления пищи), но к настоящему времени термин \"недоедание\" уже давно ассоциируется с этим показателем. </p>\n<p>Принимая во внимание, что состояние недоедания применяется к отдельным лицам вследствие концептуальных и связанных с данными соображений, показатель может относиться только к населению или группе лиц. Таким образом, распространенность недоедания является оценкой доли лиц в группе, которые находятся в этом состоянии, но не позволяет определить, какие именно люди в группе фактически недоедают. </p><h1>Источники данных </h1>\n<h2>Описание: </h2>\n<p>Идеальным источником данных для оценки распространенности недоедания (РН) было бы тщательно разработанное и умело проведенное обследование индивидуального рациона питания, в котором исследовалось бы фактическое ежедневное потребление пищи вместе с измерением роста и веса для каждого обследуемого индивида, многократно фиксируемые в выборочной совокупности, являющейся репрезентативной для целевой группы населения. Однако из-за их стоимости такие обследования проводятся редко.</p>\n<p>В принципе, хорошо спланированное обследование домашних хозяйств, в ходе которого собирается информация о приобретении продуктов питания, может оказаться достаточным для получения достоверной оценки распространенности недоедания среди населения при разумных затратах на их проведение и с необходимой периодичностью для информационной поддержки процессе мониторинга показателей Целей устойчивого развития, при условии, что: </p>\na) Должным образом учитывается потребление продуктов питания всеми членами домохозяйств из всех источников, включая, в частности, пищу, потребляемую вне дома;\nb) Имеется достаточно информации для пересчета данных по потреблению продовольствия или по расходам на продукты питания в их вклад в калорийность пищи;\nc) Используются правильные методы для расчета распространенности недоедания, чтобы контролировать избыточную дисперсию оцениваемого уровня привычного потребления продуктов питания среди домашних хозяйств, допуская наличие нормальной дисперсии в распределении потребления продуктов питания среди отдельных лиц, вызванной различиями в энергетических потребностях людей.\n<p>Примерами обследований, которые можно принять во внимание для достижения этой цели, являются обследования, проводимые для расчета показателей экономической статистики и проведения оценок уровня бедности, например, такие как обследования доходов и расходов домашних хозяйств, обследования бюджетов домашних хозяйств и обследования оценки уровня жизни.</p>\n<p>Однако на практике зачастую невозможно и не рекомендуется полагаться только на данные, собранные в ходе обследования домохозяйств, поскольку информация, необходимая для оценки четырех параметров модели распространенности недоедания (РН), отсутствует или является неточной.</p>\n<p>С данными обследования по потреблению продуктов питания домашними хозяйствами зачастую должны учитываться </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Данные по демографической половозрастной структуре исследуемого населения; </li>\n  <li>Данные или информация о среднем росте лиц каждого пола и возрастной группы; </li>\n  <li>Данные по распределению уровней физической активности населения; </li>\n  <li>Альтернативные данные по общему количеству продовольствия, имеющегося для потребления людьми, чтобы корректировать погрешности в среднем значении национального потребления населением калорий с приёмом пищи. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Данные по пунктам a), b) и c) могут быть получены с помощью того же многоцелевого обследования, которое предоставляет данные по потреблению продуктов питания, но более вероятно, что они доступны из других источников, таких как национальные демографические и медицинские обследования (для a) и b)) и обследования бюджетов времени (для c)). </p>\n<p>Коррекция отклонений в оценках среднего значения суточного потребления калорий, возможно, должна основываться на альтернативных источниках информации о потреблении продуктов питания, таких как суммарный показатель снабжения продуктами питания, счета использования и продовольственные балансы.</p>\n<p>Для формирования оценки распространенности недоедания (РН) на национальном, региональном и глобальном уровнях, в дополнение ко всем обследованиям домашних хозяйств, по которым можно получить микроданные по потреблению продуктов питания, ФАО полагается на: </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Мировые демографические перспективы Отдела народонаселения ООН (<a href=\"https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/\">https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/</a>), которые предоставляют раз в два года для большинства стран мира обновленные оценки половозрастной структуры населения; </li>\n  <li>Продовольственные балансы ФАО (<a href=\"http://faostat3.fao.org/download/FB/*/E\">http://faostat3.fao.org/download/FB/*/E</a>), которые предоставляют каждый год для большинства стран мира обновленные национальные оценки доступности продовольствия.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Микро-данные из обследований домашних хозяйств, собирающих данные по потреблению продуктов питания, которые ФАО скачивает непосредственно из веб-сайтов национальных статистических управлений или получает в рамках конкретных двусторонних соглашений.</p><h2>Процесс сбора: </h2>\n<p>Официальная информация о производстве, торговле и потреблении продуктов питания, используемая ФАО для составления продовольственных балансов, предоставляется, главным образом, статистическими подразделениями Министерства сельского хозяйства.

Показатель позволяет отслеживать пределы недостаточности энергетической калорийности рациона питания населения с течением времени, возникающие в результате сочетания изменений в общей доступности продуктов питания, в возможностях домашних хозяйств получить к ним доступ, в социально-демографических характеристиках населения, а также в различиях между странами и регионами в любой данный момент времени. </Р>\n<p> Параметрический подход, принятый ФАО, позволяет получать достоверные оценки для относительно больших групп населения. Поскольку показатель отражает тяжелое состояние, связанное с нехваткой продовольствия, он полностью соответствует духу цели, направленной на сокращение голода. </Р><h2>Комментарии и ограничения: </h2>\n<p>На протяжении многих лет параметрический подход, использующийся при расчете оценки распространенности недоедания, подвергался критике, исходя из предположения, что недоедание следует оценивать, основываясь на уровне индивидуума, путем сравнения индивидуальных потребностей в энергии с индивидуальным потреблением энергии, поступающей с пищей. Согласно такому мнению, распространенность недоедания может быть просто вычислена путем подсчета количества лиц в репрезентативной выборке населения, которые классифицируются как недоедающие, на основе сопоставления привычного потребления пищи и потребностей в пище на уровне индивидуума. К сожалению, реализовать такой подход не представляется возможным по двум причинам: во-первых, из-за стоимости обследований индивидуального пищевого рациона, индивидуальное потребление продуктов питания оценивается лишь в нескольких странах каждые несколько лет на относительно небольших выборках; кроме того, индивидуальные энергетические потребности практически невозможно наблюдать с помощью стандартных методов сбора данных (до такой степени, что наблюдаемое обычное потребление энергии индивидуумом в здоровом состоянии – это по-прежнему предпочтительный способ определения индивидуальных энергетических потребностей). Это означает, что даже если бы можно было получить данные точных наблюдений индивидуального потребления калорий, этого будет недостаточно, чтобы сделать вывод о состоянии недоедания на уровне индивидуума, если только не учитывать обследование физического статуса (Индекс массы тела) одного и того же человека и его динамику во времени. </p>\n<p>Модельный подход для оценки распространенности недоедания, разработанный ФАО, учитывает информацию, которая доступна с достаточной регулярностью из разных источников для большинства стран мира, теоретически последовательным способом, таким образом, обеспечивая то, что до сих пор является одним из самых надежных инструментов для отслеживания прогресса в деле сокращения масштабов голода в мире. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Дальнейшее конкретное рассмотрение:</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Реализуемость </em></p>\n<p>Оценка распространенности недоедания на национальном уровне стала возможной для большинства стран мира с 1999 года. В худшем случае, когда данные по потреблению продуктов питания нельзя было получить в ходе недавнего обследования домашних хозяйств, оценка распространенности недоедания, основанная на модели, опиралась на оценку среднего уровня калорийность пищи (DEC) на основе продовольственных балансов (ПБ), на косвенную оценку коэффициента вариации (CV) на основе данных по ВВП страны, на коэффициент дохода Джини, на индекс относительных цен на продовольствие или иных показателях развития, таких как уровень смертности детей в возрасте до 5 лет и оценка минимально необходимой калорийности пищи (MDER) на основе данных Мировых демографических перспектив Отдела народонаселения ООН</p>\n<p><em>Надежность </em></p>\n<p>Надежность в основном зависит от качества данных, используемых для формирования параметров модели.</p>\n<p>Уровень калорийность пищи (DEC) может быть оценен либо на основе данных обследования, либо на основе продовольственных балансов. Оба источника не лишены недостатков. При сравнении оценок калорийности пищи в стране (DEC) на основе продовольственных балансов (ПБ) и обследований часто отмечаются различия.</p>\n<p>Оценки калорийности пищи на основе данных обследований могут быть подвержены влиянию систематических погрешностей измерений из-за занижения данных по потреблению продуктов питания или неполного учета всех источников потребления продуктов питания. Недавние исследования показывают, что отрицательное смещение до более чем 850 ккал может быть вызвано предполагаемым ежедневным потреблением калорий в расчете на душу населения, вызванное типом программы потребления продуктов питания, выбранной для сбора данных на уровне домохозяйств. (См. De Weerdt et al., 2015, Table 2, <a href=\"https://feb.kuleuven.be/drc/licos/publications/dp/DP%20365%20Complete.pdf%20\">https://feb.kuleuven.be/drc/licos/publications/dp/DP%20365%20Complete.pdf</a>). Детальный анализ недавнего обследования бюджетов домашних хозяйств в Бразилии показал, что питание, предоставляемое бесплатно в рамках программы школьного питания и употребляемое детьми в школе, не было учтено среди источников потребления продуктов питания домохозяйством, что означало занижение суточной калорийности потребленных продуктов питания в среднем на душу населения, составляющей 674 ккал. (См. Borlizzi, Cafiero Del Grossi, готовится к выпуску.) </p>\n<p>В оценках потребления калорий на основе продовольственных балансов также могут быть ошибки, хотя трудно установить направление вызванных погрешностей. Так как средний уровень доступности продовольствия является остаточным в методе продовольственных балансов, любые ошибки в данных по производству, торговле и запасах могут повлиять на оценки наличия продовольствия на страновом уровне. Кроме того, ошибки могут быть вызваны трудностями в надлежащем бухгалтерском учете всех форм использования продовольственных товаров. Поскольку все эти ошибки являются некоррелированными, влияние на предполагаемое среднее потребление продуктов питания будет меньше, чем у каждой из ошибок, рассматриваемых отдельно. Тем не менее, учитывая, насколько проблематично точно учитывать различия в государственных резервах продовольственных товаров, относительно которых официальные данные могут быть недостоверны, следует признать, что, по оценкам, изменения годового запаса подвержены значительной неопределенности, которые перейдут в оценку потребления калорий в каждом конкретном году. </p>\n<p>В целях ограничения последствий от влияния таких ошибок ФАО традиционно представляет оценки распространенности недоедания на страновом уровне в виде средних показателей за три года, исходя из предположения о том, что ошибки, вызванные неточным учетом колебаний запасов в каждом отдельном году, могут сильно сократиться при рассмотрении среднего показателя за три года подряд. </p>\n<p>Данные обследований являются единственным источником для оценки CV и асимметрии. Как описано в разделе \"Метаданные, относящиеся к методу расчета\", если данные не получены из высококачественных обследований индивидуального пищевого рациона, то их необходимо обработать, чтобы снизить вероятность завышения оценки коэффициента вариации CV, вызванную ложными колебаниями из-за ошибок в оценке обычного потребления калорий на уровне индивидуума. </p>\n<p><em>Сопоставимость</em></p>\n<p>Если используется один и тот же метод расчета, то сопоставимость во времени и пространстве относительно высока, и единственной потенциальной причиной неоднородности является различное качество исходных данных. </p>\n<p><em>Ограничения </em></p>\n<p>Из-за вероятностного характера вывода и спектра неопределенности, связанных с оценками каждого из параметров модели, точность оценки распространенности недоедания, как правило, низкая. Хотя невозможно рассчитать теоретические пределы погрешности (MoE) для оценки распространенности недоедания, вероятно, они превышают плюс или минус 2,5% в большинстве случаев. По этой причине ФАО публикует оценки распространенности недоедания на страновом уровне только тогда, когда они превышают 2,5%. Это также предполагает, что 2,5% - это самые низкие осуществимые цели, которые могут быть установлены для показателя распространенности недоедания, т.е. величина, которая является неудовлетворительно большой, когда речь идет о стремлении полностью искоренить такое бедствие, как голод.</p>\n<p>Если не проводятся обследования, в рамках которых собираются данные по потреблению продуктов питания и которые являются репрезентативными на субнациональном уровне, то этот показатель может быть рассчитан только на национальном уровне.</p><h1>Методология </h1>\n<h2>Метод расчета: </h2>\n<p>Показатель рассчитывается на уровне населения. С этой целью население представлено “среднестатистическим” индивидом, для которого распределение вероятностей привычного ежедневного уровня потребления калорий моделируется путем параметрической функции плотности вероятностей (ФПВ). </p>\n<p>Как только параметрическая функция плотности вероятностей охарактеризована, показатель рассчитывается как интегральная вероятность того, что ежедневные привычные уровни потребления калорий (х) находятся ниже нижней границы диапазона нормальных калорийностей пищевого рациона для этого представителя или среднестатистического индивидуума (MDER), как показано в нижеприведенной формуле: </p>\n<p>PoU= &#x222B;_(x&lt;MDER) f(x | DEC; CV; Skew) dx </p>\n<p>где DEC, CV и Skew – это средние значения, коэффициент вариации и асимметрия характеризуют распределение привычных уровней потребления калорий в рационе населения. </p>\n<p>До 2012 года, распределение вероятностей f(х) моделировалась как логарифмически нормальная параметрическая функция плотности вероятностей, опиравшаяся только на два параметра: среднее арифметическое значение и коэффициент вариации. В своей последней формулировке она моделируется как параметрическая функция плотности вероятностей из трех параметров, способная представлять различные степени асимметрии, начиная от симметричного нормального распределения до положительной асимметрии логарифмически нормального распределения. Гибкость в захвате разных степеней асимметрии необходима, чтобы учесть тот факт, что уровни потребления энергии человеком естественным образом ограничены физиологическими пределами. Поэтому можно предположить, что по мере увеличения средних уровней потребления, асимметрия распределения уменьшается, постепенно переходя от логарифмически нормального распределения (с положительной асимметрией), характерного для населения, у которого среднее потребление продуктов питания является относительно низким, к (симметричным) нормальным распределениям. Нормальная асимметрия и логарифмически нормальная асимметрия семейства распределения позволяют охарактеризовать все возможные промежуточные степени положительной асимметрии. (Подробное описание см. <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e.pdf%20\">http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e.pdf</a>).</p>\n<p>Пользовательская функция R может быть получена из статистического отдела ФАО для расчета оценки распространенности недоедания, с учетом четырех параметров оценки уровня потребления калорий (DEC), коэффициента вариации CV, асимметрии (Skew) и минимальной калорийности пищевого рациона (MDER). </p>\n<p>Для оценки различных параметров модели могут использоваться различные источники данных. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Уровень потребления калорий (DEC) </em></strong></p>\n<p>Среднее значение распределения уровней потребления калорий (DEC) для среднестатистического индивида из населения в среднем соответствует, по определению, ежедневному среднедушевому уровню потребления продуктов питания населением. </p>\n<p>Уровень потребления калорий (DEC) можно оценить на основе данных по потреблению продуктов питания, полученных в ходе обследований, которые являются репрезентативными для исследуемой группы населения. В зависимости от плана выборки обследования, они могут быть использованы для оценки DEC на национальном и субнациональном уровнях, либо в разбивке по географическим районам или социально-экономическим группам населения. К сожалению, хотя ситуация стремительно улучшается, репрезентативные обследования, собирающие данные по потреблению продуктов питания, по-прежнему не осуществляются во всех странах и не проводятся каждый год. </p>\n<p>Только для населения страны уровень потребления калорий (DEC) может быть оценен на основе сведений об общем объеме поставок и потребления всех продовольственных товаров в стране, где вклад каждого товара в наличие продовольствия для потребления человеком выражается в энергетической калорийности питания, а их сумма делится на численность населения. Основным источником данных по национальным продовольственным балансам являются продовольственные балансы (FBS), которые ведутся ФАО для большинства стран мира (см. <ref=\"http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/fbs/en/\">http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/fbs/en/</a>), которые составляются на основе официальных данных, представляемых странами-членами, и распространяются через ФАОСТАТ (<a href=\"http://faostat3.fao.org/download/FB/*/E\">http://faostat3.fao.org/download/FB/*/E</a>). </p>\n<p><strong><em>CV </em></strong></p>\n<p>Обследования, которые поставляют информацию о потреблении продуктов питания на индивидуальном уровне и уровне домохозяйства, являются единственным доступным источником для прямой оценки коэффициента вариации (CV) обычного потребления продуктов питания для репрезентативного представителя населения. К сожалению, с данными обследования о потреблении продуктов питания связано много проблем, которые усложняют получение достоверной оценки коэффициента вариации CV. </p>\n<p>В принципе, для оценки уровня привычного потребления и для определения погрешностей оценки было бы необходимо проводить неоднократные наблюдения суточного потребления для каждого человека в выборке. Кроме того, данные следовало бы собирать в различные периоды года для одних и тех же лиц или домашних хозяйств, чтобы учесть возможные сезонные колебания в уровнях потребления калорий. Но из-за их стоимости национальные обследования индивидуального пищевого рациона с такими характеристиками проводятся очень редко и практически отсутствуют в большинстве развивающихся стран. Как следствие, наиболее распространенными источниками данных для оценки коэффициента вариации CV являются многоцелевые обследования домашних хозяйств, такие как исследования критериев оценки уровня жизни, обследования доходов и расходов домашних хозяйств (или обследование бюджетов домашних хозяйств), в ходе которых также собирается информация о потреблении продуктов питания. Однако, при использовании данных, собранных на уровне домохозяйств, следует обращать пристальное внимание на отличие уровней закупок или приобретения продуктов питания от уровней их фактического использования (потребления и нерациональных потерь) в течение указанного отчетного периода и с учетом надлежащей регистрации числа лиц, которые участвуют в потреблении; кроме того, данные на уровне домохозяйств будут маскировать изменчивость из-за распределения продовольствия внутри домашнего хозяйства. </p>\n<p>С учетом всех этих причин коэффициент вариации, рассчитанный на основе ряда среднедушевых показателей ежедневных уровней потребления калорий, зарегистрированных для каждого домашнего хозяйства, включенного в обследование, никогда не является надежной оценкой коэффициента вариации CV, которая должна была бы отражать вариацию в уровнях привычного (а не случайного) суточного потребления калорий на индивидуальном уровне (а не на уровне домохозяйства). Эмпирические оценки коэффициента вариации CV с использованием данных обследования домашних хозяйств являются завышенными из-за ложной вариации, вызванной погрешностью измерения, различиями между эпизодическим и привычным потреблением, различиями между приобретением и фактическим потреблением и сезонностью; кроме того, они не отражают вариации в уровне потребления калорий населением, связанной с индивидуальными особенностями членов домохозяйства (например, пол, возраст, масса тела и уровень физической активности). </p>\n<p>Таким образом, при использовании данных, собранных в ходе обследований домашних хозяйств, коэффициент вариации CV лучше всего оценивать косвенно с учетом ложной вариации и скорректировать для отражения вариации между людьми (в дополнение к вариации между домохозяйствами). Начать проще всего с классифицирования домашних хозяйств по однородным группам и рассчитать коэффициент вариации среднедушевых показателей уровня потребления калорий по группам домашних хозяйств. Это дает оценку междомохозяйственной составляющей коэффициента вариации CV, обозначенной как CV_H. Оценка межиндивидуальной составляющей коэффициента вариации CV, обозначенная как CV_I, формируется для каждой группы населения на основе ее состава по полу, возрасту и массе тела, и эти два компонента объединяют, чтобы получить необходимую оценку: </p>\n<p>CV^ = v[(CV_H)^2+(CV_I)^2 )]. </p>\n<p>Для стран и тех лет, когда отсутствуют данные по обследованию домашних хозяйств, косвенная оценка коэффициента вариации CV, CV_IND формируется с помощью регрессии, которая отражает значения ВВП на душу населения, коэффициент Джини и индекс относительных цен на продовольствие (FPI) по коэффициенту вариации CV, при этом учитывая региональный сдвиг (REG). </p>\n<p>CV^_IND=&#xDF;_0+&#xDF;_1 GDP+ &#xDF;_2 GINI+ &#xDF;_3 FPI+&#xDF;_4 REG. </p>\n<p>Коэффициенты регрессии оцениваются на основе набора данных и лет, за которые имеются данные по коэффициенту вариации CV, ВВП (GDP), коэффициенту Джини (GINI) и индексу относительных цен на продовольствие (FPI). </p>\n<p><strong><em>Skew </em></strong></p>\n<p>Так как на асимметрию не сильно влияет наличие ложной вариации, асимметрия оценивается непосредственно из данных средних показателей ежедневного потребления калорий на уровне домашних хозяйств, с единственным условием исключения редких крайне высоких или крайне низких значений. Если эмпирически оцененная асимметрии превышает значение, которое будет соответствовать асимметрии логарифмически нормального распределения с заданными средним значением и коэффициентом вариации, этим параметром пренебрегают и логарифмически нормальное распределение двух параметров используется для f(х). (Для получения дополнительной информации см. <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e.pdf</a>). </p>\n<p><strong><em>MDER </em></strong></p>\n<p>Потребности человека в энергии рассчитываются путем умножения нормативных требований к базовому уровню метаболизма (BMR, выраженному в кг массы тела), на идеальный вес здорового человека заданного роста, а затем умножают на коэффициент уровня физической активности (PAL). Таким образом, диапазоны нормальных энергетических потребностей рассчитываются для каждой половозрастной группы населения, учитывая, что существует целый ряд значений индекса массы тела (ИМТ) (BMI) – от 18,5 до 25 – которые соответствуют состоянию здоровья. Это означает, что любой заданный рост может соответствовать целому ряду значений здоровой массы тела, и, следовательно, диапазону значений для количества энергии, требуемого для базового уровня метаболизма (BMR). </p>\n<p>Учитывая информацию о среднем росте и ввиду того, что в группе могут быть лица, имеющие разные уровни физической активности, минимальную, среднюю и максимальную калорийность пищевого рациона можно вычислить для каждого пола и возрастной категории с учетом специальной надбавки на рост у лиц в возрасте от 0 до 21 года и для женщин в период беременности и лактации. </p>\n<p>(См. <a href=\"ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/007/y5686e/y5686e00.pdf\">ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/007/y5686e/y5686e00.pdf</a> для более подробной информации). </p>\n<p>Минимальная калорийность пищевого рациона (MDER) определенной группы населения, в том числе для населения страны, получается как средневзвешенное значение минимумов диапазонов пищевого рациона каждого пола и возрастной категории, с использованием численности населения в каждой категории в качестве весов. </p>\n<p>При расчете распространенности недостаточной калорийности питания среди населения часто происходила путаница между понятиями минимальной калорийности пищевого рациона (MDER) и рекомендуемым уровнем потребления калорий, а также относительно соответствующего порогового значения, которое следует использовать для вычисления вероятности недостаточности. Причиной, по которой вероятность недостаточной калорийности питания должна быть рассчитана со ссылкой на минимальную калорийность пищевого рациона (MDER), а не на среднюю калорийность пищевого рациона (ADER) (который, вместо этого, может быть использован в качестве оценки среднего уровня рекомендуемого потребления пищи для всего населения) состоит в том, что нужно просто признать тот факт, что в любом населении существует определенный диапазон нормальной изменчивости в потребностях; использование ADER в качестве порогового значения сильно переоценило бы недоедание, поскольку при этом учитывалась бы и часть здорового населения, которое потребляет меньше среднего уровня, просто потому, что их потребности ниже среднего уровня. При необходимости, ADER, или средний рекомендуемый уровень потребления калорий среди населения, должен быть использован для расчета разницы в потреблении калорий.</p><h2>Обработка отсутствующих значений: </h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>На страновом уровне: </li></strong> </em>\n</ul>\n<p>При отсутствии данных по потреблению продуктов питания в недавнем обследовании домашних хозяйств, моделируемая оценка распространенности недоедания (РН) формируется с использованием оценки уровня потребления калорий (DEC) из продовольственных балансов (Food Balance Sheets), косвенной оценки коэффициента вариации (CV), основанной на информации о ВВП страны, коэффициента Джини, индекса относительных цен на продовольствие или другие показателей развития таких, как уровень смертности детей в стране в возрасте до 5 лет и оценка минимальной калорийности пищевого рациона (MDER) на основе данных Мировых демографических перспектив Отдела народонаселения ООН. </p>\n<p>См. подробнее раздел о методике расчетов. </p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>На региональном и глобальном уровнях:</strong></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Недостающие значения для отдельных стран неявно вменяются, чтобы они стали равны средневзвешенным значениям показателей населения стран, которые находятся в том же регионе. </p><h2>Региональные агрегаты: </h2>\n<p>Региональные и глобальные показатели распространенности недоедания (РН) рассчитываются как: </p>\n<p>PoU_REG = (_i PoU_i &#xD7; N_i) / (_i N_i) </p>\n<p>где PoU_i являются значениями распространенности недоедания (РН) для всех стран региона, по которым имеются данные, позволяющие рассчитать достоверную оценку, и N_i - численностью соответствующего населения. </p><h2>Методы и руководства, доступные странам для составления данных на национальном уровне: </h2>\n<p>На национальном уровне существуют три основных источника данных: </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Официальные отчеты о производстве, торговле и использовании основных продовольственных культур и продукции животноводства. </li>\n  <li>Данные обследования домохозяйств по потреблению продуктов питания</li>\n  <li>Демографические характеристики населения страны </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Источниками данных для сельскохозяйственного производства обычно являются национальные обследования, которые проводятся Министерством сельского хозяйства / животноводства и / или Национальным статистическим управлением. Обследования обычно проводятся ежегодно, и, при отсутствии прямых оценок, используется информация о площадях / количестве животных и урожайности / весах туши для расчета количества продуктов растениеводства или животноводства. Сельскохозяйственные переписи, которые ФАО рекомендует проводить каждые десять лет, могут дополнять эти обследования, предоставляя более обновленные результаты оценок по сельскохозяйственным культурам и поголовью скота, и, таким образом, позволяют составлять более точные прогнозы / корректировки. </p>\n<p>Источником данных по торговле сельскохозяйственной и пищевой продукцией является почти исключительно национальная таможня (за немногими исключениями, когда данные могут быть получены из Центрального банка). Страны часто готовят эти торговые отчеты в соответствии с международными стандартными форматами (классификации товаров / стран, единицы измерения, данные по торговым партнерам). Хотя такие данные по торговле могут считаться достаточно надежными, поскольку они являются результатом непосредственного измерения / представления данных таможенной службой / ее отчетности, но проблемы незарегистрированной приграничной торговли (и перемещения животных), неправильная классификация товаров, вопросы конфиденциальности данных, временная задержка и многое другое могут потребовать некоторого анализа и проверки данных (часто обращаясь к зеркальной статистике торговли для перекрестной проверки количеств и цен). </p>\n<p>Данные по использованию первичных и переработанных культур и домашнего скота могут быть получены в результате специализированных обследований (дополненных исследованиями) в рамках национальной системы промышленности переработки сельскохозяйственной продукции. В данном случае интерес представляют количества, предназначенные, в частности, для кормов для животных, для промышленного использования (например, для производства биотоплива), для национальных запасов/предприятий/ферм, для семян (посевы для последующего сельскохозяйственного цикла); для того, чтобы обеспечить как можно более точную оценку количества, предназначенного/доступного для потенциального потребления человеком. </p>\n<p>Эти наборы данных (производство, торговля и использование) после перекрестной проверки и валидации образуют основу для составления продовольственных балансов (FBS). Продовольственный баланс- это система учета, при которой предложение (производство + импорт + уменьшение запасов) должно равняться использованию (экспорт + переработка продуктов питания + корм + семена + промышленное использование и т. д.). Следует отметить, что в рамках продовольственного баланса потери после уборки / убоя (вплоть до уровня розничной торговли) рассматриваются как использование и, таким образом, являются компонентом сальдирования продовольственного баланса. Структура продовольственного баланса предоставляет зафиксированный снимок ситуации с сельскохозяйственными поставками на национальном уровне и позволяет создать структуру с перекрестными ссылками, посредством которой данные, официальные или оценочные / вмененные, могут быть дополнительно проанализированы и проверены (например, отчетность по численности животных может быть занижена / недооценена). Основным результатом составления продовольственного баланса является расчет уровня потребления калорий (DES) в килокалориях на человека (на основе численности населения) в конкретном году (количество, которое может использоваться человеком, преобразуется в их калорийные эквиваленты с использованием соответствующих коэффициентов пересчета питательных веществ по товарам). Уровень потребления калорий, в отсутствие данных по прямому потреблению, получаемых в ходе обследований домашних хозяйств, является одним из ключевых компонентов при расчете распространенности недоедания (РН). В настоящее время ФАО приступает к осуществлению более целенаправленной программы по предоставлению странам возможностей продовольственного баланса, включая обновленный инструмент для его составления. </p>\n<p>ФАО получает данные по первичной / переработанной продукции растениеводства / животноводства и их основном использовании с помощью специальных вопросников, которые ежегодно рассылаются во все страны. Официальные статистические данные по торговле по странам получаются ежегодно путем массовой загрузки базы данных по торговле Организации Объединенных Наций (ожидается, что страны будут отчитываться перед СОООН ежегодно). В некоторых случаях, когда это возможно, также используются национальные данные продовольственных балансов. Эти наборы данных затем проверяются и формируют исходные данные для продовольственных балансов стран, которые собирает ФАО. Следует отметить, что когда данные официально не представляются / недоступны (как это часто бывает в случае данных по использованию сырьевых товаров), то тогда необходимо прибегнуть к вменениям для восполнения пробелов в данных. </p>\n<p>Новое Руководство по составлению национальных продовольственных балансов (завершено недавно в сотрудничестве с Глобальной стратегией) и новый инструмент составления (приложение, основанное на R-методе). </p>\n<p><strong><em>Детальное описание методологии продовольственного баланса: </em></strong><a href=\"http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/fbs/ess-fbs02/en/\">http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/fbs/ess-fbs02/en/</a>. </p>\n<p>Руководство по продовольственным балансам, показанное здесь, не следует путать с недавно завершенными Рекомендациями по продовольственным балансам. Руководство носит более технический характер и разъясняет методологию, которой придерживается ФАО при составлении продовольственного баланса страны.

Учитывая сложившуюся практику в проведении национальных обследований домашних хозяйств, достаточно достоверная информация, помимо уровня макро-региона проживания (город-село) и основных областей/округов в стране, редко доступна для дезагрегирования. В той степени, в которой большинство используемых обследований спланированы для точной оценки распределения доходов, можно сделать вывод об оценке распространенности недоедания в слоях населения с различными доходами. Распределение по полу ограничивается возможностью выявлять и группировать домашние хозяйства по гендерным признакам (например, пол главы домашнего хозяйства или соотношение мужчин и женщин). </p><h2>Источники расхождений: </h2>\n<p>Многие страны готовили и представляли отчеты об оценках распространенности недоедания, в том числе в своих национальных докладах по ЦРТ, но почти всегда использовалась другая методология, отличная от той, которая была разработана ФАО, что делает национальные данные несопоставимыми с данными, представленными ФАО для целей глобального мониторинга. </p>\n<p>Наиболее распространенный подход, используемый при подготовке национальных отчетов, состоит в расчете доли домохозяйств, для которых среднесуточный уровень потребления калорий в расчете на душу населения оказывается ниже пороговых значений на основе ежедневного рекомендуемого пищевого рациона, как правило, установленного на уровне 2100.00 ккал, основываясь на данных обследования домашних хозяйств. В некоторых случаях использовались более низкие пороговые значения, составляющие около 1400.00 ккал, вероятно, в качестве реакции на тот факт, что доли домохозяйств, отчитывающихся о среднесуточном потреблении, составляющем менее 2100.00 ккал на душу населения, являлись неправдоподобно высокими оценками распространенности недоедания. </p>\n<p>Почти без исключения не рассматривается наличие избыточной вариации в данных по потреблению калорий и отчеты показывают ограниченный, либо отсутствующий прогресс в сокращении распространенности недоедания с течением времени. </p>\n<p>Как уже говорилось в разделе, посвященном методологии расчета, результаты, полученные с помощью этих альтернативных методов, весьма ненадежны и почти наверняка смещены в сторону завышения. Поэтому желательно приложить согласованные усилия для пропаганды использования методов ФАО также при подготовке национальных докладов. ФАО готова оказывать всю необходимую техническую поддержку. </p><h1>Ссылки </h1>\n<h2>URL: </h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-fs/en/\">http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-fs/en/</a> </p>\n<p><strong>Ссылки: </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/012/w0931e/w0931e16.pdf%20\">http://www.fao.org/docrep/012/w0931e/w0931e16.pdf</a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/Y4249E/y4249e06.htm%23bm06%20\">http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/Y4249E/y4249e06.htm#bm06</a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4060e.pdf%20\">http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4060e.pdf</a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e.pdf</a> </p>"}}
