	<message>The DOC_METHOD field for indicator 4-c-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The UIS has elaborated guidance for the countries on the methodology that should be used to calculate this indicator. ISCED mappings that help countries report their data in an internationally comparable framework are available on the website of the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (&lt;a href=&quot;http://uis.unesco.org/en/isced-mappings&quot;&gt;http://uis.unesco.org/en/isced-mappings&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Administrative teachers&amp;#x2019; data from schools and other organized learning centres are gathered through the national annual schools census. The collected data are usually stored in the national Education Management Information System (EMIS) according to procedures in place in each country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assist countries to make a more informed choice in relation to EMIS, by developing standards about what an EMIS must be able to do in order to supply accurate and valid information to education sector policymakers, school managers, and international organisations as part of international data reporting, the UIS in collaboration with the Global Partnership for Education, has developed EMIS user&amp;#x2019;s and buyer&amp;#x2019;s guides ( &lt;a href=&quot;http://emis.uis.unesco.org/buyers-and-users-guide/&quot;&gt;http://emis.uis.unesco.org/buyers-and-users-guide/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
