	<message>The QUALITY_ASSMNT field for indicator 4-c-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Accurate data on the number of teachers at each level of education who have the minimum required qualifications and the total number of teachers at each level in a given academic year are essential for calculating this indicator. Criteria for quality assessment include: data sources must include proper documentation; data values must be representative at the national population level and, if not, should be footnoted; data are plausible and based on trends and consistency with previously published/reported values for the indicator. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
