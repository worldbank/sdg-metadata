{"status":"success","message":"The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 4-c-1, translated into en","data":"<p>Teachers&#x2019; data used to produce this indicator are gathered through the annual Survey of Formal Education. The data received are validated using electronic error detection systems that check for arithmetic errors and inconsistencies and trend analysis for implausible results. Queries are taken up with the relevant agencies in individual countries or country representatives reporting the data so that corrections can be made (of errors) or explanations given (of implausible but correct results). During this process countries are also encouraged to provide estimates for missing or incomplete data items.</p>\n<p>In addition, countries have an opportunity to review, comment on, and validate the main indicators the UIS produces in an annual &#x201C;country review&#x201D; of indicators before the publication of the data by the UIS. </p>"}
