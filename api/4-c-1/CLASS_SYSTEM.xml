&lt;p&gt;The minimum organized pedagogical teacher training pre-service and in-service required for teaching at the relevant level is defined according to national standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UIS is developing an International Standard Classification of Teacher Training Programmes (ISCED-T) to support the production of internationally comparable data on teacher training programmes, and to improve the availability and quality of teacher statistics, especially in reference to national programmes for pre-service teacher education. ISCED-T will also aid explore the development of an international standard for &amp;#x201C;trained&amp;#x201D; and &amp;#x201C;qualified&amp;#x201D; teachers that could be used alongside the national standards currently used for the monitoring of this target. A draft proposal of ISCED-T is submitted to the 41st Session of the UNESCO General Conference for consideration and adoption in November 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
