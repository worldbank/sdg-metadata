	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 4-c-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Teachers play a key role in ensuring the quality of education provided. Ideally all teachers should receive adequate, appropriate and relevant pedagogical training to teach at the chosen level of education and be academically well-qualified in the subject(s) they are expected to teach. This indicator measures the share of the teaching work force which is pedagogically well-trained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high value indicates that students are being taught by teachers who are pedagogically well-trained to teach.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
