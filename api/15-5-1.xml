&lt;p&gt;The Red List Index measures change in aggregate extinction risk across groups of species. It is based on genuine changes in the number of species in each category of extinction risk on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (www.iucnredlist.org) is expressed as changes in an index ranging from 0 to 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concepts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threatened species are those listed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in the categories Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered (i.e., species that are facing a high, very high, or extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the medium-term future). Changes over time in the proportion of species threatened with extinction are largely driven by improvements in knowledge and changing taxonomy. The indicator excludes such changes to yield a more informative indicator than the simple proportion of threatened species. It therefore measures change in aggregate extinction risk across groups of species over time, resulting from genuine improvements or deteriorations in the status of individual species. It can be calculated for any representative set of species that have been assessed for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species at least twice (Butchart et al. 2004, 2005, 2007). To calculate the Red List Index for individual countries and regions, each species contributing to the index is weighted by the proportion of its global range within the particular country or region. The resulting index therefore shows the aggregate extinction risk for species within the country or region relative to its potential contribution to global species extinction risk (within the taxonomic groups included).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Red List Index for a particular country or region is an index of the aggregate extinction risk for species within the country or region relative to its potential contribution to global species extinction risk (within the taxonomic groups included).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is measured on a scale of 0 to 1, where 1 is the maximum contribution that the country or region can make to global species survival, equating to all species being classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, and 0 is the minimum contribution that the country or region can make to global species survival, equating to all species in the country or region having gone extinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Red List Index is based on categorisations of species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iucnredlist.org&quot;&gt;www.iucnredlist.org&lt;/a&gt;), defined following IUCN (2012a).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Red List Index is based on data from The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iucnredlist.org&quot;&gt;www.iucnredlist.org&lt;/a&gt;), in particular the numbers of species in each Red List category of extinction risk, and changes in these numbers over time resulting from genuine improvements or deteriorations in the status of species. Data on species&amp;#x2019; distribution, population size, trends and other parameters that underpin Red List assessments are gathered from published and unpublished sources, species experts, scientists, and conservationists through correspondence, workshops, and electronic fora. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A detailed description of the Red List Assessment process is provided at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucnredlist.org/assessment/process&quot;&gt;https://www.iucnredlist.org/assessment/process&lt;/a&gt;. See also information under other categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is updated at least three times per year. Red List Indices for sets of species that have been comprehensively reassessed are usually released alongside the relevant update of the IUCN Red List. Data are stored and managed in the Species Information Service database, and are made freely available for non-commercial use through the IUCN Red List website (www.iucnredlist.org). Re-assessments of extinction risk are required for every species assessed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species once every ten years, and ideally undertaken once every five years. A Red List Strategic Plan details a calendar of upcoming re-assessments for each taxonomic group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Red List Index is updated annually in November-December using the latest data from reassessments on the IUCN Red List.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National agencies producing relevant data include government, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and academic institutions working jointly and separately. Data are gathered from published and unpublished sources, species experts, scientists, and conservationists through correspondence, workshops, and electronic fora. Data are submitted by national agencies to IUCN, or are gathered through initiatives of the Red List Partnership. The members of the Red List Partnership are listed at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucnredlist.org/about/partners&quot;&gt;https://www.iucnredlist.org/about/partners&lt;/a&gt;, and currently include: ABQ BioPark; Arizona State University Centre for Biodiversity Outcomes; BirdLife International; Botanic Gardens Conservation International; Conservation International; Global Wildlife Conservation; Missouri Botanical Garden; NatureServe; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; Sapienza University of Rome; Texas A&amp;amp;M University; and Zoological Society of London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compilation and reporting of the Red List Index at the global level is conducted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and BirdLife International, on behalf of the Red List Partnership. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responsibility for overseeing Red List assessments, which underpin the Red List Index, is assigned to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red List Authorities according to the IUCN Red List Rules of Procedure (https://nc.iucnredlist.org/redlist/content/attachment_files/Rules_of_Procedure_for_IUCN_Red_List_2017-2020.pdf). The role of Red List Authorities is to ensure that all species within their remit are correctly assessed against the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria at least once every ten years and, if possible, every five years. Further details of the roles and responsibilities of Red List Authorities are provided at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucnredlist.org/assessment/authorities&quot;&gt;https://www.iucnredlist.org/assessment/authorities&lt;/a&gt;, and the full list and contact details for all appointed Red List Authorities are available at https://www.iucn.org/commissions/ssc-groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world&amp;#x2019;s species are impacted by a number of threatening processes, including habitat destruction and degradation, overexploitation, invasive alien species, human disturbance, pollution and climate change. This indicator can be used to assess overall changes in the extinction risk of groups of species as a result of these threats and the extent to which threats are being mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Red List Index value ranges from 1 (all species are categorized as &amp;#x2018;Least Concern&amp;#x2019;) to 0 (all species are categorized as &amp;#x2018;Extinct&amp;#x2019;), and so indicates how far the set of species has moved overall towards extinction. Thus, the global Red List Index allows comparisons between sets of species in both their overall level of extinction risk (i.e., how threatened they are on average), and in the rate at which this risk changes over time. A downward trend in the global Red List Index over time means that the expected rate of future species extinctions is worsening (i.e., the rate of biodiversity loss is increasing). An upward trend means that the expected rate of species extinctions is abating (i.e., the rate of biodiversity loss is decreasing), and a horizontal line means that the expected rate of species extinctions is remaining the same, although in each of these cases it does not mean that biodiversity loss has stopped. An upward global Red List Index trend would indicate that the SDG Target 15.5 of reducing the degradation of natural habitats and protecting threatened species is on track. A global Red List Index value of 1 would indicate that biodiversity loss has been halted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name &amp;#x201C;Red List Index&amp;#x201D; should not be taken to imply that the indicator is produced as a composite indicator of a number of disparate metrics (in the same way that, e.g., the Multidimensional Poverty Index is compiled). The Red List Index provides an indicator of trends in species&amp;#x2019; extinction risk, as measured using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (Mace et al. 2008, IUCN 2012a), and is compiled from data on changes over time in the Red List Category for each species, excluding any changes driven by improved knowledge or revised taxonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Red List Index was used as an indicator towards the 2011&amp;#x2013;2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014, CBD 2020a), the Convention on Biological Diversity&amp;#x2019;s 2010 Target (Butchart et al. 2010) and Millennium Development Goal 7. It has been proposed as a Headline Indicator in the draft post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (CBD 2020b).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are four main sources of uncertainty associated with Red List Index values and trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inadequate, incomplete or inaccurate knowledge of a species&amp;#x2019; status. This uncertainty is minimized by assigning estimates of extinction risk to categories that are broad in magnitude and timing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Delays in knowledge about a species becoming available for assessment. Such delays apply to a small (and diminishing) proportion of status changes, and can be overcome in the Red List Index through back-casting (Butchart et al. 2007).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inconsistency between species assessments. These can be minimized by the requirement to provide supporting documentation detailing the best available data, with justifications, sources, and estimates of uncertainty and data quality, which are checked and standardized by IUCN through Red List Authorities, a Red List Technical Working Group and an independent Standards and Petitions Sub-committee. Further, detailed Guidelines on the Application of the Categories and Criteria are maintained (IUCN SPSC 2019), as is an online training course (in English, Spanish and French).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Species that are too poorly known for the Red List Criteria to be applied are assigned to the Data Deficient category. For birds, only 0.8% of extant species are evaluated as Data Deficient, compared with 24% of amphibians. If Data Deficient species differ in the rate at which their extinction risk is changing, the Red List Index may give a biased picture of the changing extinction risk of the overall set of species. The degree of uncertainty this introduces is estimated through a bootstrapping procedure that randomly assigns each Data Deficient species a category based on the numbers of non-Data Deficient species in each Red List category for the set of species under consideration, and repeats this for 1,000 iterations, plotting the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles as lower and upper confidence intervals for the median.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main limitation of the Red List Index is related to the fact that the Red List Categories are relatively broad measures of status, and thus the Red List Index for any individual taxonomic group can practically be updated at intervals of at least four years. However, as the overall index is aggregated across multiple taxonomic groups, with groups reassessed asynchronously, it can be updated annually. A further limitation is that the Red List Index does not reflect particularly well the deteriorating status of common species that remain abundant and widespread but are declining slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Red List Index is calculated at a point in time by first multiplying the number of species in each Red List Category by a weight (ranging from 1 for &amp;#x2018;Near Threatened&amp;#x2019; to 5 for &amp;#x2018;Extinct&amp;#x2019; and &amp;#x2018;Extinct in the Wild&amp;#x2019;) and summing these values. This is then divided by a maximum threat score, which is the total number of species multiplied by the weight assigned to the &amp;#x2018;Extinct&amp;#x2019; category. This final value is subtracted from 1 to give the Red List Index value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematically this calculation is expressed as: &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;mi&gt;E&lt;/mi&gt;
            &lt;mi&gt;X&lt;/mi&gt;
          &lt;/mrow&gt;
        &lt;/msub&gt;
        &lt;mi&gt;*&lt;/mi&gt;
        &lt;mi&gt;N&lt;/mi&gt;
        &lt;mo&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;
      &lt;/mrow&gt;
    &lt;/mfrac&gt;
  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where Wc(t,s) is the weight for category (c) at time (t) for species (s) (the weight for &amp;#x2018;Critically Endangered&amp;#x2019; = 4, &amp;#x2018;Endangered&amp;#x2019; = 3, &amp;#x2018;Vulnerable&amp;#x2019; = 2, &amp;#x2018;Near Threatened&amp;#x2019; = 1, &amp;#x2018;Least Concern&amp;#x2019; = 0. &amp;#x2018;Critically Endangered&amp;#x2019; species tagged as &amp;#x2018;Possibly Extinct&amp;#x2019; or &amp;#x2018;Possibly Extinct in the Wild&amp;#x2019; are assigned a weight of 5); WEX = 5, the weight assigned to &amp;#x2018;Extinct&amp;#x2019; or &amp;#x2018;Extinct in the Wild&amp;#x2019; species; and N is the total number of assessed species, excluding those assessed as Data Deficient in the current time period, and those considered to be &amp;#x2018;Extinct&amp;#x2019; in the year the set of species was first assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formula requires that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exactly the same set of species is included in all time periods, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The only Red List Category changes are those resulting from genuine improvement or deterioration in status (i.e., excluding changes resulting from improved knowledge or taxonomic revisions), and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data Deficient species are excluded (or treated according to the procedure described above).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, species lists will change slightly from one assessment to the next (e.g., owing to taxonomic revisions). The conditions can therefore be met by retrospectively adjusting earlier Red List categorizations using current information and taxonomy. This is achieved by assuming that the current Red List Categories for the taxa have applied since the set of species was first assessed for the Red List, unless there is information to the contrary that genuine status changes have occurred. Such information is often contextual (e.g., relating to the known history of habitat loss within the range of the species). If there is insufficient information available for a newly added species, it is not incorporated into the Red List Index until it is assessed for a second time, at which point earlier assessments are retrospectively corrected by extrapolating recent trends in population, range, habitat and threats, supported by additional information. To avoid spurious results from biased selection of species, Red List Indices are typically calculated only for taxonomic groups in which all species worldwide have been assessed for the Red List, or for samples of species that have been systematically or randomly selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The methods and scientific basis for the Red List Index were described by Butchart et al. (2004, 2005, 2007, 2010). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butchart et al. (2010) also described the methods by which Red List Indices for different taxonomic groups are aggregated to produce a single multi-taxon Red List Index. Specifically, aggregated Red List Indices are calculated as the arithmetic mean of modelled Red List Indices. Red List Indices for each taxonomic group are interpolated linearly for years between data points and extrapolated linearly (with a slope equal to that between the two closest assessed points) to align them with years for which Red List Indices for other taxa are available. The Red List Indices for each taxonomic group for each year are modelled to take into account various sources of uncertainty: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data Deficiency: Red List categories (from Least Concern to Extinct) are assigned to all Data Deficient species, with a probability proportional to the number of species in non-Data Deficient categories for that taxonomic group; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extrapolation uncertainty: although RLIs were extrapolated linearly based on the slope of the closest two assessed point, there is uncertainty about how accurate this slope may be. To incorporate this uncertainty, rather than extrapolating deterministically, the slope used for extrapolation is selected from a normal distribution with a probability equal to the slope of the closest two assessed points, and standard deviation equal to 60% of this slope (i.e., the CV is 60%); &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Temporal variability: the &amp;#x2018;true&amp;#x2019; Red List Index likely changes from year to year, but because assessments are repeated only at multi-year intervals, the precise value for any particular year is uncertain. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this uncertainty explicit, the Red List Index value for a given taxonomic group in a given year is assigned from a moving window of five years, centred on the focal year (with the window set as 3-4 years for the first two and last two years in the series). Note that assessment uncertainty cannot yet be incorporated into the index. Practically, these uncertainties are incorporated into the aggregated Red List Indices as follows: Data Deficient species were allotted a category as described above, and a Red List Index for each taxonomic group was calculated interpolating and extrapolating as described above. A final Red List Index value was assigned to each taxonomic group for each year from a window of years as described above. Each such &amp;#x2018;run&amp;#x2019; produced a Red List Index for the complete time period for each taxonomic group, incorporating the various sources of uncertainty. Ten thousand such runs are generated for each taxonomic group, and the mean is calculated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods for generating national disaggregations of the Red List Index are described below in section 5 on Data availability and disaggregation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red List Assessments are checked before submission to IUCN by Assessors and Red List Authority Coordinators, to ensure that all of the required supporting information is provided in the appropriate format, distribution maps follow the required mapping standards (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/mappingstandards&quot;&gt;https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/mappingstandards&lt;/a&gt;), and the IUCN Red List Criteria have been applied appropriately and consistently following IUCN Guidelines (IUCN SPSC 2019). For further details, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucnredlist.org/assessment/process&quot;&gt;https://www.iucnredlist.org/assessment/process&lt;/a&gt;. All submitted assessments must be reviewed by at least one Reviewer designated by the Red List Authority. For more details on the review process, see the Rules of Procedure (&lt;a href=&quot;https://nc.iucnredlist.org/redlist/content/attachment_files/Rules_of_Procedure_for_IUCN_Red_List_2017-2020.pdf&quot;&gt;https://nc.iucnredlist.org/redlist/content/attachment_files/Rules_of_Procedure_for_IUCN_Red_List_2017-2020.pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Red List Indices are updated each year, the updated index (and underlying numbers of species in each Red List Category) are made available for review by countries prior to submission to the SDG Indicators Database. This is achieved through updating the country profiles in the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles&quot;&gt;https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles&lt;/a&gt;) and circulating these for consultation and review to CBD National Focal Points, SDG National Statistical Office Focal Points, and IUCN State Members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No adjustments are made to the index with respect to harmonization of breakdowns or for compliance with specific international or national definitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At country level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red List Indices for each taxonomic group are interpolated linearly for years between data points and extrapolated linearly (with a slope equal to that between the two closest assessed points, except for corals) back to the earliest time point and forwards to the present for years for which estimates are not available. The start year of the aggregated index is set as ten years before the first assessment year for the taxonomic group with the latest starting point. Corals are not extrapolated linearly because declines are known to have been much steeper subsequent to 1996 (owing to extreme bleaching events) than before. Therefore, the rate of decline prior to 1996 is set as the average of the rates for the other taxonomic groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At regional and global levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Red List Index is calculated globally based on assessments of extinction risk of each species included, because many species have distributions that span many countries. Thus, while there is certainly uncertainty around the Red List Index, there are no missing values as such, and so no imputation is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Red List Categories and Criteria are applied for each species on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and are determined globally and provided principally by the Specialist Groups and stand-alone Red List Authorities of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, IUCN Secretariat-led initiatives, and Red List partner organizations. The staff of the IUCN Global Species Programme compile, validate, and curate these data, and are responsible for publishing and communicating the results. Each individual species assessment is supported by the application of metadata and documentation standards (IUCN 2013), including classifications of, for example, threats and conservation actions (Salafsky et al. 2008). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red List assessments are undertaken either through open workshops or open-access web-based discussion fora. Assessments are reviewed by the appropriate Red List Authority (an individual or organization appointed by the IUCN Species Survival Commission to review assessments for specific species or groups of species) to ensure standardisation and consistency in the interpretation of information and application of the criteria. A Red List Technical Working Group and the IUCN Red List Unit work to ensure consistent categorization between species, groups and assessments. Finally, a Standards and Petitions Sub-committee monitors the process and resolves challenges and disputes over Red List assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, IUCN publishes guidelines on applying the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria at regional or national scales (IUCN 2012b). Based on these, many countries have initiated programmes to assess the extinction risk of species occurring within their borders. These countries will be able to implement the Red List Index based on national extinction risk, once they have carried out at least two national Red Lists using the IUCN system in a consistent way (Bubb et al. 2009). An increasing number of countries have now completed national Red List Indices for a range of taxa (e.g., G&amp;#xE4;rdenfors 2010, Pihl &amp;amp; Flensted 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While global Red List Indices can be disaggregated to show trends for species at smaller spatial scales, the reverse is not true. National or regional Red List Indices cannot be aggregated to produce Red List Indices showing global trends. This is because a taxon&amp;#x2019;s global extinction risk has to be evaluated at the global scale and cannot be directly determined from multiple national scale assessments across its range (although the data from such assessments can be aggregated for inclusion in the global assessment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods for generating regional disaggregations of the Red List Index are described below in section 5 on Data availability and disaggregation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See above. In sum: the data underlying the Red List Index are compiled under the authority of the IUCN Red List Committee, through application of the IUCN Red List Categories &amp;amp; Criteria (&lt;a href=&quot;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10315&quot;&gt;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10315&lt;/a&gt;). This includes submissions of endemics from national red list processes, where these have been conducted following the &amp;#x201C;Guidelines for application of IUCN Red List Criteria at Regional and National Levels&amp;#x201D; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10336&quot;&gt;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10336&lt;/a&gt;) and following the &amp;#x201C;Required and Recommended Supporting Information for IUCN Red List Assessments&amp;#x201D; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/supporting-information-guidelines&quot;&gt;https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/supporting-information-guidelines&lt;/a&gt;). Assessments may be submitted in all three IUCN languages (English, French and Spanish) and Portuguese. All assessments are peer reviewed through the relevant Red List Authority for the species or species group in question, as documented in the Red List Rules of Procedure (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/rules-of-procedure&quot;&gt;https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/rules-of-procedure&lt;/a&gt;); see in particular Annex 3, the &amp;#x201C;Details of the Steps Involved in the IUCN Red List Process&amp;#x201D; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://nc.iucnredlist.org/redlist/content/attachment_files/Details_of_the_Steps_Involved_in_the_IUCN_Red_List_Process.pdf&quot;&gt;https://nc.iucnredlist.org/redlist/content/attachment_files/Details_of_the_Steps_Involved_in_the_IUCN_Red_List_Process.pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key document providing international recommendations and guidelines to countries and all involved in application of the IUCN Red List Categories &amp;amp; Criteria (&lt;a href=&quot;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10315&quot;&gt;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10315&lt;/a&gt;) is the &amp;#x201C;Guidelines for Using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria&amp;#x201D; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/redlistguidelines&quot;&gt;https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/redlistguidelines&lt;/a&gt;; available in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese) accompanied by the &amp;#x201C;Required and Recommended Supporting Information for IUCN Red List Assessments&amp;#x201D;. For countries (and regions), this is supplemented by the &amp;#x201C;Guidelines for application of IUCN Red List Criteria at Regional and National Levels&amp;#x201D; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10336&quot;&gt;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10336&lt;/a&gt;). To support the calculation of Red List Indices for any given country (or region), &amp;#x201C;Code (and documentation) for calculating and plotting national RLIs weighted by the proportion of each species&amp;#x2019; distribution within a country or region&amp;#x201D; is posted online (Dias et al. 2020; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BirdLifeInternational/rli-codes&quot;&gt;https://github.com/BirdLifeInternational/rli-codes&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods for generating national disaggregations of the Red List Index are described below in section 5 on Data availability and disaggregation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See above and below, and full documentation in the Red List Rules of Procedure (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/rules-of-procedure&quot;&gt;https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/rules-of-procedure&lt;/a&gt;) in particular Annex 3, the &amp;#x201C;Details of the Steps Involved in the IUCN Red List Process&amp;#x201D; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://cmsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/keydocuments/Details_of_the_Steps_Involved_in_the_IUCN_Red_List_Process.pdf&quot;&gt;https://cmsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/keydocuments/Details_of_the_Steps_Involved_in_the_IUCN_Red_List_Process.pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See above, and full documentation in the Red List Rules of Procedure (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/rules-of-procedure&quot;&gt;https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/rules-of-procedure&lt;/a&gt;) in particular Annex 3, the &amp;#x201C;Details of the Steps Involved in the IUCN Red List Process&amp;#x201D; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://cmsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/keydocuments/Details_of_the_Steps_Involved_in_the_IUCN_Red_List_Process.pdf&quot;&gt;https://cmsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/keydocuments/Details_of_the_Steps_Involved_in_the_IUCN_Red_List_Process.pdf&lt;/a&gt;). In sum: all Red List assessments are peer reviewed through the relevant Red List Authority for the species or species group in question; and all Red List assessments undergo consistency checks (to ensure consistency with assessments submitted for other taxonomic groups, regions, processes, etc.) by the Red List Unit before publication on the Red List website (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iucnredlist.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.iucnredlist.org/&lt;/a&gt;). Finally, the Chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission (elected each four years by the government and non-governmental Members of IUCN) appoints a Chair for a Standards and Petitions Sub-Committee (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucn.org/our-union/commissions/group/iucn-ssc-standards-and-petitions-committee&quot;&gt;https://www.iucn.org/our-union/commissions/group/iucn-ssc-standards-and-petitions-committee&lt;/a&gt;), which is responsible for ensuring the quality and standards of the IUCN Red List and for ruling on petitions against the listings of species on the IUCN Red List. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IUCN Red List is governed by a Red List Committee (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucn.org/our-union/commissions/group/iucn-ssc-red-list-committee&quot;&gt;https://www.iucn.org/our-union/commissions/group/iucn-ssc-red-list-committee&lt;/a&gt;), comprising representatives from the Red List Partnership, the IUCN Species Survival Commission, and the IUCN Secretariat. This committee establishes and maintains the Red List Strategic Plan, including ongoing evaluation of fitness for use i.e. the degree to which the IUCN Red List meets user&amp;#x2019;s requirements. This encompasses, inter alia, considerations of relevance, accuracy, timeliness, consistency, comprehensiveness, and accessibility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Red List Index has been classified by the IAEG-SDGs as Tier 1. Current data are available for all countries in the world, and these are updated annually. Index values for each country are available in the UN SDG Indicators Database &lt;a href=&quot;https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/&quot;&gt;https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/&lt;/a&gt;. Red List Index graphs and underlying index data are available for each country, SDG regions, IPBES region, CMS region and various thematic disaggregations at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucnredlist.org/search&quot;&gt;https://www.iucnredlist.org/search&lt;/a&gt;. Red List Index graphs are also available for each country in the BIP Indicators Dashboard (&lt;a href=&quot;https://bipdashboard.natureserve.org/bip/SelectCountry.html&quot;&gt;https://bipdashboard.natureserve.org/bip/SelectCountry.html&lt;/a&gt;), the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool Country Profiles (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles&quot;&gt;https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles&lt;/a&gt;), and (for birds) on the BirdLife International Data Zone (http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/dashboard).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Red List Index can be downscaled to show national and regional Red List Indices, weighted by the fraction of each species&amp;#x2019; distribution occurring within the country or region, building on the method published by Rodrigues et al. (2014) PLoS ONE 9(11): e113934. These show an index of how well species are conserved in a country or region to its potential contribution to global species conservation (for the taxonomic groups of species included). The index is calculated as: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where t is the year of comprehensive reassessment, u is the spatial unit (i.e. country), W_((t,s)) is the weight of the global Red List category for species s at time t (Least Concern =0, Near Threatened =1, Vulnerable =2, Endangered =3, Critically Endangered =4, Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) =5, Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct in the Wild) =5, Extinct in the Wild =5 and Extinct =5), WEX = 5 is the weight for Extinct species, r_su is the fraction of the total range of species s in unit u, and R_s is the total range size of species s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index varies from 1 if the country has contributed the minimum it can to the global RLI (i.e., if the numerator is 0 because all species in the country are Least Concern) to 0 if the country has contributed the maximum it can to the global RLI (i.e., if the numerator equals the denominator because all species in the country are Extinct or Possibly Extinct). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The taxonomic groups included are those in which all species have been assessed for the IUCN Red List more than once. Red List categories for years in which comprehensive assessments (i.e. those in which all species in the taxonomic group have been assessed) were carried out are determined following the approach of Butchart et al. 2007; PLoS ONE 2(1): e140, i.e. they match the current categories except for those taxa that have undergone genuine improvement or deterioration in extinction risk of sufficient magnitude to qualify for a higher or lower Red List category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator can also be disaggregated by ecosystems, habitats, and other political and geographic divisions (e.g., Han et al. 2014), by taxonomic subsets (e.g., Hoffmann et al. 2011), by suites of species relevant to particular international treaties or legislation (e.g., Croxall et al. 2012), by suites of species exposed to particular threatening processes (e.g., Butchart 2008), and by suites of species that deliver particular ecosystem services, or have particular biological or life-history traits (e.g., Regan et al. 2015). In each case, information can be obtained from The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species to determine which species are relevant to particular subsets (e.g., which occur in particular ecosystems, habitats, and geographic areas of interest). These disaggregations are available on the IUCN Red List website at https://www.iucnredlist.org/search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disaggregations of the Red List Index are also of particular relevance as indicators towards the following SDG targets (Brooks et al. 2015): SDG 2.4 Red List Index (species used for food and medicine); SDG 2.5 Red List Index (wild relatives and local breeds); SDG 12.2 Red List Index (impacts of utilisation) (Butchart 2008); SDG 12.4 Red List Index (impacts of pollution); SDG 13.1 Red List Index (impacts of climate change); SDG 14.1 Red List Index (impacts of pollution on marine species); SDG 14.2 Red List Index (marine species); SDG 14.3 Red List Index (reef-building coral species) (Carpenter et al. 2008); SDG 14.4 Red List Index (impacts of utilisation on marine species); SDG 15.1 Red List Index (terrestrial &amp;amp; freshwater species); SDG 15.2 Red List Index (forest-specialist species); SDG 15.4 Red List Index (mountain species); SDG 15.7 Red List Index (impacts of utilisation) (Butchart 2008); and SDG 15.8 Red List Index (impacts of invasive alien species) (Butchart 2008, McGeoch et al. 2010).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some countries have assessed the national extinction risk of species occurring in the country, and have repeated such assessments, allowing a national Red List Index to be produced. This may differ from the indicator described here because (a) it considers national rather than global extinction risk, and (b) because it takes no account of the national responsibility for the conservation of each species, treating as equal both those species that occur nowhere outside the country (i.e. national endemics) and those with large ranges that occur in many other countries. Any such differences will be smaller for countries within which a high proportion of species are endemic (i.e., only found in that country), as in many island nations and mountainous countries, especially in the tropics. The differences will be larger for countries within which a high proportion of species have widespread distributions across many nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Definición: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Índice de la Lista Roja mide el cambio en el riesgo de extinción agregado entre grupos de especies. Se basa en cambios genuinos en el número de especies en cada categoría de riesgo de extinción en La Lista Roja de Especies Amenazadas de la UICN (UICN 2015) se expresa como cambios en un índice que varía de 0 a 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conceptos: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Las especies amenazadas son aquellas que figuran en la Lista Roja de Especies Amenazadas de la UICN en las categorías Vulnerables, En Peligro o Críticamente Amenazadas (es decir, especies que enfrentan un alto, muy alto o extremadamente alto riesgo de extinción en la naturaleza en el futuro a medio plazo). Los cambios a lo largo del tiempo en la proporción de especies en peligro de extinción están impulsados en gran medida por mejoras en el conocimiento y cambios en la taxonomía. El indicador excluye tales cambios para producir un indicador más informativo que la simple proporción de especies amenazadas. Por lo tanto, mide el cambio en el riesgo de extinción agregado entre grupos de especies a lo largo del tiempo, como resultado de mejoras o deterioros genuinos en el estado de las especies individuales. Puede calcularse para cualquier conjunto representativo de especies que hayan sido evaluadas para la Lista Roja de Especies Amenazadas de la UICN al menos dos veces (Butchart et al. 2004, 2005, 2007). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Fuentes de datos&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Descripción:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entre los organismos nacionales que producen datos pertinentes figuran el Gobierno, las organizaciones no gubernamentales (ONG) y las instituciones académicas que trabajan conjuntamente y por separado. Los datos se recopilan de fuentes publicadas e inéditas, expertos en especies, científicos y conservacionistas a través de correspondencia, talleres y programas electrónicos. Los datos son presentados por los organismos nacionales a la UICN, o se recopilan a través de iniciativas de la Asociación de la Lista Roja. Desde 2013&amp;#x2013;6, la Asociación de la Lista Roja abarcó: BirdLife International; Botanic Gardens Conservation International; Conservación Internacional; Microsoft; NatureServe; Real Jardín Botánico, Kew; Universidad Sapienza de Roma; Universidad de Texas A&amp;amp;M; Pantalla salvaje; y Zoological Society of London. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Proceso de recolección:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ver información en otras categorías. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Calendario &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recopilación de datos: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Lista Roja de Especies Amenazadas de la UICN se actualiza anualmente. Los índices de la Lista Roja para cualquier conjunto de especies que se hayan reevaluado exhaustivamente en ese año generalmente se publican junto con la actualización de la Lista Roja de la UICN. Los datos se almacenan y gestionan en la base de datos del Servicio de Información de Especies y están disponibles gratuitamente para uso no comercial a través del sitio web de la Lista Roja de la UICN. Se requieren reevaluaciones del riesgo de extinción para cada especie evaluada en la Lista Roja de Especies Amenazadas de la UICN una vez cada diez años, e idealmente una vez cada cuatro años. Un Plan Estratégico de la Lista Roja detalla un calendario de próximas reevaluaciones para cada grupo taxonómico. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lanzamiento de datos:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Por lo general, cada año se dispone de nuevos datos para el Índice de la Lista Roja. Por ejemplo, el primer Índice de la Lista Roja para las cícadas se publicó en 2015, las actualizaciones de los Índices de la Lista Roja para aves y mamíferos se publicarán en 2016, y las actualizaciones para las coníferas y los tiburones se anticipan en 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Proveedores de datos&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entre los organismos nacionales que producen datos pertinentes figuran el gobierno, las organizaciones no gubernamentales (ONG) y las instituciones académicas que trabajan conjuntamente y por separado.

&lt;h2&gt;Nombre:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UICN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Descripción:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La compilación y presentación de informes del Índice de la Lista Roja a nivel mundial está a cargo de la Unión Internacional para la Conservación de la Naturaleza (UICN) y BirdLife International, en nombre de la Asociación de la Lista Roja. Por ejemplo, Baillie et al. (2004) y Hoffmann et al. (2010) han publicado síntesis exhaustivas de la Lista Roja de Especies Amenazadas de la UICN. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Justificación:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Las especies del mundo se ven afectadas por una serie de procesos amenazantes, incluyendo la destrucción y degradación del hábitat, la sobreexplotación, las especies exóticas invasoras, la perturbación humana, la contaminación y el cambio climático. Este indicador puede utilizarse para evaluar los cambios generales en el riesgo de extinción de grupos de especies como resultado de estas amenazas y la medida en que se están mitigando las amenazas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El valor del Índice de la Lista Roja varía de 1 (todas las especies se clasifican como &amp;#x2018;Preocupación menor&amp;#x2019;) a 0 (todas las especies se clasifican como &amp;#x2018;Extintas&amp;#x2019;), y por lo tanto indica hasta qué punto el conjunto de especies se ha movido en general hacia la extinción. Por lo tanto, el Índice de la Lista Roja permite comparaciones entre conjuntos de especies tanto en su nivel general de riesgo de extinción (es decir, qué tan amenazadas están en promedio), como en la tasa a la que este riesgo cambia con el tiempo. Una tendencia a la baja en el Índice de la Lista Roja a lo largo del tiempo significa que la tasa esperada de extinciones futuras de especies está empeorando (es decir, la tasa de pérdida de biodiversidad está aumentando). Una tendencia al alza significa que la tasa esperada de extinciones de especies está disminuyendo (es decir, la tasa de pérdida de biodiversidad está disminuyendo), y una línea horizontal significa que la tasa esperada de extinciones de especies sigue siendo la misma, aunque en cada uno de estos casos no significa que la pérdida de biodiversidad se haya detenido. Una tendencia al alza del Índice de la Lista Roja indicaría que la Meta 15.5 de los ODS de reducir la degradación de los hábitats naturales y proteger las especies amenazadas va por buen camino. Un valor de índice de la Lista Roja de 1 indicaría que se ha detenido la pérdida de biodiversidad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El nombre &amp;#x201C;Índice de la Lista Roja&amp;#x201D; no debe entenderse como un indicador compuesto de una serie de métricas dispares (de la misma manera que, por ejemplo, se compila el Índice de Pobreza Multidimensional). El Índice de la Lista Roja proporciona un indicador de las tendencias en el riesgo de extinción de especies, medido utilizando las Categorías y Criterios de la Lista Roja de la UICN (Mace et al. 2008, IUCN 2012a), y se compila a partir de datos sobre los cambios a lo largo del tiempo en la Categoría de la Lista Roja para cada especie, excluyendo cualquier cambio impulsado por un mejor conocimiento o una taxonomía revisada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Índice de la Lista Roja se utiliza como indicador hacia el Plan Estratégico para la Diversidad Biológica 2011&amp;#x2013;2020 (CDB 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014), y se utilizó como indicador hacia la Meta 2010 del Convenio sobre la Diversidad Biológica (Butchart et al. 2010) y el Objetivo de Desarrollo del Milenio 7. También se puede proyectar para evaluar escenarios de desarrollo futuros (Visconti et al. 2015). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Comentarios y limitaciones:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hay cuatro fuentes principales de incertidumbre asociadas con los valores y las tendencias del Índice de la Lista Roja. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conocimiento inadecuado, incompleto o inexacto del estado de una especie. Esta incertidumbre se minimiza asignando estimaciones del riesgo de extinción a categorías que son amplias en magnitud y momento. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Retrasos en el conocimiento de una especie que está disponible para su evaluación. Tales retrasos se aplican a una pequeña (y decreciente) proporción de cambios de estatus, y pueden ser superados en el Índice de la Lista Roja a través del cálculo retrospectivo. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inconsistencia entre las evaluaciones de especies. Estos pueden reducirse al mínimo mediante el requisito de proporcionar documentación de apoyo que detalle los mejores datos disponibles, con justificaciones, fuentes y estimaciones de incertidumbre y calidad de los datos, que son verificadas y estandarizadas por la UICN a través de las Autoridades de la Lista Roja, un Grupo de Trabajo Técnico de la Lista Roja y un Subcomité independiente de Normas y Peticiones. Además, se mantienen directrices detalladas sobre la aplicación de las categorías y criterios (IUCN SPSC 2016), así como un curso de formación en línea (en inglés, español y francés). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Las especies que son demasiado poco conocidas para que se apliquen los Criterios de la Lista Roja se asignan a la categoría de Datos Deficientes y se excluyen del cálculo del Índice de la Lista Roja. De las aves, solo el 0,8% de las especies existentes se evalúan como Deficientes en Datos, en comparación con el 24% de los anfibios. Si las especies con datos deficientes difieren en la tasa a la que su riesgo de extinción está cambiando, el Índice de la Lista Roja puede dar una imagen sesgada del riesgo de extinción cambiante del conjunto general de especies. El grado de incertidumbre que esto introduce se estima a través de un procedimiento autodecimante que asigna aleatoriamente a cada especie con datos deficientes una categoría basada en el número de especies no deficientes en datos en cada categoría de la Lista Roja para el conjunto de especies bajo consideración, y repite esto para 1,000 iteraciones, trazando los percentiles 2.5 y 97.5 como intervalos de confianza inferior y superior para la mediana. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La principal limitación del Índice de la Lista Roja está relacionada con el hecho de que las Categorías de la Lista Roja son medidas relativamente amplias de estatus, y por lo tanto el Índice de la Lista Roja para cualquier grupo taxonómico individual puede actualizarse prácticamente a intervalos de al menos cuatro años. Como el índice general se agrega a través de múltiples grupos taxonómicos, se puede actualizar típicamente anualmente. Además, el Índice de la Lista Roja no refleja particularmente bien el estado de deterioro de las especies comunes que siguen siendo abundantes y generalizadas, pero que están disminuyendo lentamente. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Metodología&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Método de cálculo:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Índice de la Lista Roja se calcula en un momento dado multiplicando primero el número de especies en cada categoría de la Lista Roja por una ponderación (que va de 1 para &amp;#x2018;Casi Amenazado&amp;#x2019; a 5 para &amp;#x2018;Extinto&amp;#x2019; y &amp;#x2018;Extinto en estado salvaje&amp;#x2019;) y sumando estos valores. A continuación se divide por una puntuación de amenaza máxima que es el número total de especies multiplicado por la ponderación asignada a la categoría &amp;#x2018;Extinta&amp;#x2019;. Este valor final se resta de 1 para obtener el valor del Índice de la Lista Roja.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matemáticamente este cálculo se expresa como: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ILRt = 1 &amp;#x2013; [(Ss Wc(t,s) / (WEX * N)]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donde Wc(t,s) es la ponderación de la categoría (c) en el momento (t) para la especie (s) (la ponderación para &amp;#x2018;En peligro crítico&amp;#x2019; = 4, &amp;#x2018;En peligro&amp;#x2019; = 3, &amp;#x2018;Vulnerable&amp;#x2019; = 2, &amp;#x2018;Casi amenazada&amp;#x2019; = 1, &amp;#x2018;Preocupación menor&amp;#x2019; = 0. A las especies &amp;#x2018;En peligro crítico&amp;#x2019; etiquetadas como &amp;#x2018;Posiblemente extinta&amp;#x2019; o &amp;#x2018;Posiblemente extinta en estado salvaje&amp;#x2019; se les asigna una ponderación de 5); WEX = 5, la ponderación asignada a las especies &amp;#x2018;Extinto&amp;#x2019; o &amp;#x2018;Extinta en estado salvaje&amp;#x2019;; y N es el número total de especies evaluadas, excluyendo las evaluadas como Datos Insuficientes en el período actual, y las consideradas como &amp;#x2018;Extintas&amp;#x2019; en el año en que el conjunto de especies fue evaluado por primera vez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; La fórmula requiere que:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Se incluya exactamente el mismo conjunto de especies en todos los periodos de tiempo, y&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;los únicos cambios en la categoría de la Lista Roja sean los que resultan de una auténtica mejora o deterioro del estado (es decir, se excluyen los cambios resultantes de la mejora de los conocimientos o de las revisiones taxonómicas), y&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;se excluyan las especies con datos insuficientes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En muchos casos, las listas de especies cambiarán ligeramente de una evaluación a la siguiente (por ejemplo, debido a revisiones taxonómicas). Por lo tanto, las condiciones pueden cumplirse ajustando retrospectivamente las categorizaciones anteriores de la Lista Roja utilizando la información y la taxonomía actuales. Esto se consigue asumiendo que las categorías actuales de la Lista Roja para los taxones se han aplicado desde que el conjunto de especies fue evaluado por primera vez para la Lista Roja, a menos que haya información que indique lo contrario y que se hayan producido verdaderos cambios de estado. Dicha información suele ser contextual (por ejemplo, relacionada con la historia conocida de pérdida de hábitat dentro del área de distribución de la especie). Si no se dispone de suficiente información sobre una especie recién añadida, no se incorpora al Índice de la Lista Roja hasta que se evalúa por segunda vez, momento en el que las evaluaciones anteriores se corrigen retrospectivamente extrapolando las tendencias recientes de la población, el área de distribución, el hábitat y las amenazas, con el apoyo de información adicional. Para evitar resultados espurios derivados de una selección sesgada de especies, los Índices de la Lista Roja suelen calcularse sólo para grupos taxonómicos en los que todas las especies del mundo han sido evaluadas para la Lista Roja, o para muestras de especies que han sido seleccionadas sistemática o aleatoriamente.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Los métodos y la base científica del Índice de la Lista Roja fueron descritos por Butchart et al. (2004, 2005, 2007, 2010). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butchart et al. (2010) también describieron los métodos por los cuales los Índices de la Lista Roja para diferentes grupos taxonómicos se agregan para producir un único Índice de la Lista Roja multi-taxón. En concreto, los Índices de la Lista Roja agregados se calculan como la media aritmética de los Índices de la Lista Roja modelados. Los Índices de la Lista Roja para cada grupo taxonómico se interpolan linealmente para los años entre los puntos de datos y se extrapolan linealmente (con una pendiente igual a la de los dos puntos evaluados más cercanos) para alinearlos con los años para los que se dispone de Índices de la Lista Roja para otros taxones. Los Índices de la Lista Roja para cada grupo taxonómico para cada año se modelan para tener en cuenta varias fuentes de incertidumbre: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deficiencia de datos: las categorías de la Lista Roja (desde Preocupación Menor hasta Extinto) se asignan a todas las especies con Datos Insuficientes, con una probabilidad proporcional al número de especies en categorías no insuficientes para ese grupo taxonómico; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Incertidumbre en la extrapolación: aunque los ILR se extrapolaron linealmente basándose en la pendiente del punto más cercano de dos evaluaciones, existe incertidumbre sobre la precisión de esta pendiente. Para incorporar esta incertidumbre, en lugar de extrapolar de forma determinista, la pendiente utilizada para la extrapolación se selecciona a partir de una distribución normal con una probabilidad igual a la pendiente de los dos puntos evaluados más cercanos, y una desviación estándar igual al 60% de esta pendiente (es decir, el CV es del 60%); &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Variabilidad temporal: el &amp;#x2018;verdadero&amp;#x2019; Índice de la Lista Roja probablemente cambie de un año a otro, pero como las evaluaciones se repiten solo a intervalos de varios años, el valor preciso para cualquier año en particular es incierto. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Para hacer explícita esta incertidumbre, el valor del Índice de la Lista Roja para un grupo taxonómico dado en un año determinado se asigna a partir de una ventana móvil de cinco años, centrada en el año focal (con la ventana fijada en 3-4 años para los dos primeros y los dos últimos años de la serie). Obsérvese que la incertidumbre de la evaluación no puede incorporarse aún al índice. En la práctica, estas incertidumbres se incorporan a los índices agregados de la Lista Roja de la siguiente manera: a las especies con datos insuficientes se les asignó una categoría como se ha descrito anteriormente, y se calculó un Índice de la Lista Roja para cada grupo taxonómico interpolando y extrapolando como se ha descrito anteriormente. Se asignó un valor final del Índice de la Lista Roja a cada grupo taxonómico para cada año de una ventana de años como se ha descrito anteriormente. Cada una de estas &amp;#x2018;ejecuciones&amp;#x2019; produjo un Índice de la Lista Roja para el período completo de cada grupo taxonómico, incorporando las diversas fuentes de incertidumbre. Se generan diez mil ejecuciones de este tipo para cada grupo taxonómico y se calcula la media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A continuación se describen los métodos para generar desagregaciones nacionales del Índice de la Lista Roja.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tratamiento de valores faltantes:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A nivel de país:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Los Índices de la Lista Roja para cada grupo taxonómico se interpolan linealmente para los años entre los puntos de datos y se extrapolan linealmente (con una pendiente igual a la de los dos puntos evaluados más cercanos, excepto para los corales) hasta el punto de tiempo más antiguo y hacia el presente para los años para los que no se dispone de estimaciones. El año de inicio del índice agregado se establece como diez años antes del primer año de evaluación para el grupo taxonómico con el punto de inicio más tardío. Los corales no se extrapolan linealmente porque se sabe que los descensos han sido mucho más pronunciados después de 1996 (debido a los eventos de blanqueo extremo) que antes. Por lo tanto, la tasa de disminución anterior a 1996 se establece como la media de las tasas de los otros grupos taxonómicos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A nivel regional y global:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Índice de la Lista Roja se calcula a nivel mundial basándose en las evaluaciones del riesgo de extinción de cada especie incluida, ya que muchas especies tienen distribuciones que abarcan muchos países. Por lo tanto, aunque ciertamente hay incertidumbre en torno al Índice de la Lista Roja, no hay valores faltantes como tales, por lo que no es necesaria la imputación.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Agregados regionales:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Las categorías y los criterios de la Lista Roja se aplican a cada una de las especies de la Lista Roja de Especies Amenazadas de la UICN y se determinan a nivel mundial y las proporcionan principalmente los Grupos Especialistas y las Autoridades independientes de la Lista Roja de la Comisión de Supervivencia de Especies de la UICN, las iniciativas dirigidas por la Secretaría de la UICN, la asociación BirdLife International y las demás organizaciones asociadas a la Lista Roja de la UICN. El personal del Programa Mundial de Especies de la UICN recopila, valida y conserva estos datos, y es responsable de publicar y comunicar los resultados. Cada evaluación individual de las especies se apoya en la aplicación de metadatos y normas de documentación (UICN 2013), incluyendo clasificaciones de, por ejemplo, amenazas y acciones de conservación (Salafsky et al. 2008). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Las evaluaciones de la Lista Roja se realizan a través de talleres abiertos o de foros de debate de libre acceso en la web. Las evaluaciones son revisadas por la Autoridad de la Lista Roja correspondiente (una persona u organización designada por la Comisión de Supervivencia de Especies de la UICN para revisar las evaluaciones de especies o grupos de especies específicos) para garantizar la normalización y la coherencia en la interpretación de la información y la aplicación de los criterios. Un Grupo de Trabajo Técnico de la Lista Roja y la Unidad de la Lista Roja de la UICN trabajan para garantizar una categorización coherente entre especies, grupos y evaluaciones. Por último, un Subcomité de Normas y Peticiones supervisa el proceso y resuelve las impugnaciones y disputas sobre las evaluaciones de la Lista Roja.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Además, la UICN publica directrices sobre la aplicación de las categorías y criterios de la Lista Roja de la UICN a escala regional o nacional (UICN 2012b). Basándose en ellas, muchos países han iniciado programas para evaluar el riesgo de extinción de las especies que se encuentran dentro de sus fronteras. Estos países podrán aplicar el Índice de la Lista Roja basado en el riesgo de extinción nacional, una vez que hayan realizado al menos dos Listas Rojas nacionales utilizando el sistema de la UICN de forma coherente (Bubb et al. 2009). Un número cada vez mayor de países ha completado los Índices de la Lista Roja nacional para una serie de taxones (por ejemplo, G&amp;#xE4;rdenfors 2010, Pihl &amp;amp; Flensted 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mientras que los Índices de la Lista Roja globales pueden desglosarse para mostrar las tendencias de las especies a escalas espaciales más pequeñas, lo contrario no es cierto. Los Índices de la Lista Roja nacionales o regionales no pueden agregarse para producir Índices de la Lista Roja que muestren las tendencias globales. Esto se debe a que el riesgo de extinción global de un taxón debe evaluarse a escala global y no puede determinarse directamente a partir de múltiples evaluaciones a escala nacional en su área de distribución (aunque los datos de dichas evaluaciones pueden agregarse para incluirlos en la evaluación global).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Métodos y directrices a disposición de los países para la compilación de los datos a nivel nacional:&lt;/h2&gt;

En resumen: los datos en los que se basa el Índice de la Lista Roja se compilan bajo la autoridad del Comité de la Lista Roja de la UICN, mediante la aplicación de los Criterios y Categorías de la Lista Roja de la UICN(&lt;a href=&quot;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10315&quot;&gt;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10315&lt;/a&gt;).

Las evaluaciones pueden presentarse en los tres idiomas de la UICN (inglés, francés y español) y en portugués.

En resumen: todas las evaluaciones de la Lista Roja son revisadas por pares a través de la Autoridad de la Lista Roja pertinente para la especie o grupo de especies en cuestión; y todas las evaluaciones de la Lista Roja se someten a controles de coherencia (para garantizar la coherencia con las evaluaciones presentadas para otros grupos taxonómicos, regiones, procesos, etc.) por la Unidad de la Lista Roja antes de su publicación en el sitio web de la Lista Roja (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iucnredlist.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.iucnredlist.org/&lt;/a&gt;). Por último, el Presidente de la Comisión de Supervivencia de Especies de la UICN (elegido cada cuatro años por los miembros gubernamentales y no gubernamentales de la UICN) nombra a un Presidente para un Subcomité de Normas y Peticiones (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucn.org/theme/species/about/species-survival-commission/ssc-leadership-and-steering-committee/sub-committees/standards-and-petitions-subcommittee&quot;&gt;https://www.iucn.org/theme/species/about/species-survival-commission/ssc-leadership-and-steering-committee/sub-committees/standards-and-petitions-subcommittee&lt;/a&gt;), que se encarga de garantizar la calidad y las normas de la Lista Roja de la UICN y de resolver las peticiones contra la inclusión de especies en la Lista Roja de la UICN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Además de la difusión a través del sitio web de la Lista Roja (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iucnredlist.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.iucnredlist.org/&lt;/a&gt;), los datos de la Lista Roja se difunden a través de la Herramienta Integrada de Evaluación de la Biodiversidad, disponible para la investigación y la conservación en línea (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/&quot;&gt;https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/&lt;/a&gt;). En ella se incorporan los documentos de los perfiles de país de todos los países del mundo que incluyen la documentación del indicador del Índice de la Lista Roja del año en curso, a partir de 2016. La primera edición de cada uno de estos Perfiles de País se envió para consulta a los Puntos Focales Nacionales del Convenio sobre la Diversidad Biológica (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml&quot;&gt;https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml&lt;/a&gt;), en la 13ª reunión de la Conferencia de las Partes del Convenio sobre la Diversidad Biológica; y este proceso se repetirá anualmente.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Disponibilidad de datos&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Descripción:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Índice de la Lista Roja ha sido clasificado por el IAEG-SDG como Nivel 1. Se dispone de datos actuales para todos los países del mundo, que se actualizan periódicamente (aproximadamente una vez cada cuatro años).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Series temporales:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desde 1980 (aproximadamente 35 años). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Desagregación:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Índice de la Lista Roja puede reducirse para mostrar los Índices de la Lista Roja nacionales y regionales, ponderados por la fracción de la distribución de cada especie que se da en el país o región, basándose en el método publicado por Rodrigues et al. (2014) PLoS ONE 9(11): e113934. Estos muestran un índice de probabilidad de supervivencia agregada (el inverso del riesgo de extinción) para todas las aves, mamíferos, anfibios, corales y cícadas que se dan en el país o región. El índice muestra el grado de conservación de las especies en un país o región en relación con su contribución potencial a la conservación global de las especies. El índice se calcula como: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RLI(t,u) = 1 &amp;#x2013; [(Ss(W(t,s) * (rsu/Rs)) / (WEX * Ss (rsu/Rs))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;donde t es el año de la reevaluación global, u es la unidad espacial (es decir país), W_((t,s)) es la ponderación de la categoría global de la Lista Roja para la especie s en el momento t (Preocupación mínima =0, Casi amenazada =1, Vulnerable =2, En peligro =3, En peligro crítico =4, En peligro crítico (posiblemente extinto) =5, En Peligro Crítico (Posiblemente Extinto en Estado Silvestre) =5, Extinto en Estado Silvestre =5 y Extinto =5), WEX = 5 es la ponderación de las especies Extintas, r_su es la fracción del área de distribución total de la especie s en la unidad u, y R_s es el tamaño total del área de distribución de la especie s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El índice varía de 1 si el país ha contribuido lo mínimo que puede al ILR global (es decir, si el numerador es 0 porque todas las especies en el país son LC) a 0 si el país ha contribuido lo máximo que puede al ILR global (es decir, si el numerador es igual al denominador porque todas las especies en el país están Extintas o Posiblemente Extintas). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Los grupos taxonómicos incluidos son aquellos en los que todas las especies han sido evaluadas para la Lista Roja de la UICN más de una vez. Las categorías de la Lista Roja correspondientes a los años en los que se han realizado evaluaciones completas (es decir, aquellas en las que se han evaluado todas las especies del grupo taxonómico) se determinan siguiendo el enfoque de Butchart et al. 2007; PLoS ONE 2(1): e140, es decir, coinciden con las categorías actuales, excepto en el caso de aquellos taxones que han experimentado una auténtica mejora o deterioro del riesgo de extinción de magnitud suficiente como para optar a una categoría de la Lista Roja superior o inferior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El indicador también se puede desglosar por ecosistemas, hábitats y otras divisiones políticas y geográficas (p. ej., Han et al. 2014), por subconjuntos taxonómicos (p. ej., Hoffmann et al. 2011), por conjuntos de especies relevantes para determinados tratados internacionales o legislación (p. ej, Croxall et al. 2012), por conjuntos de especies expuestas a determinados procesos de amenaza (p. ej., Butchart 2008) y por conjuntos de especies que prestan determinados servicios ecosistémicos o tienen determinados rasgos biológicos o vitales (p. ej., Regan et al. 2015). En cada caso, se puede obtener información de la Lista Roja de Especies Amenazadas de la UICN para determinar qué especies son relevantes para determinados subconjuntos (por ejemplo, las que se dan en determinados ecosistemas, hábitats y áreas geográficas de interés).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Los desgloses del Índice de la Lista Roja también son de especial relevancia como indicadores para las siguientes metas de los ODS (Brooks et al. 2015): ODS 2.4 Índice de la Lista Roja (especies utilizadas para la alimentación y la medicina); ODS 2.5 Índice de la Lista Roja (parientes silvestres y razas locales); ODS 12.2 Índice de la Lista Roja (impactos de la utilización) (Butchart 2008); ODS 12.4 Índice de la Lista Roja (impactos de la contaminación); ODS 13.1 Índice de la Lista Roja (impactos del cambio climático); ODS 14.1 Índice de la Lista Roja (impactos de la contaminación en las especies marinas); ODS 14.2 Índice de la Lista Roja (especies marinas); ODS 14.3 Índice de la Lista Roja (especies de coral constructoras de arrecifes) (Carpenter et al. 2008); ODS 14.4 Índice de la Lista Roja (impactos de la utilización sobre las especies marinas) &amp;#x2013; un Grupo de Expertos Técnicos ad hoc FAO-UICN está trabajando actualmente para desarrollar recomendaciones acordadas sobre el uso y la interpretación de este indicador; ODS 15.1 Índice de la Lista Roja (especies terrestres y de agua dulce); ODS 15.2 Índice de la Lista Roja (especies forestales); ODS 15.4 Índice de la Lista Roja (especies de montaña); ODS 15.7 Índice de la Lista Roja (impactos de la utilización) (Butchart 2008); y ODS 15.8 Índice de la Lista Roja (impactos de las especies exóticas invasoras) (Butchart 2008, McGeoch et al. 2010).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fuentes de discrepancia:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algunos países han evaluado el riesgo de extinción nacional de las especies presentes en el país y han repetido dichas evaluaciones, lo que permite elaborar un índice nacional de la Lista Roja. Esto puede diferir del indicador descrito aquí porque (a) considera el riesgo de extinción nacional en lugar del global, y (b) porque no tiene en cuenta la responsabilidad nacional de la conservación de cada especie, tratando como iguales tanto a las especies que no se dan en ninguna parte fuera del país (es decir, las endémicas nacionales) como a las que tienen una gran área de distribución y se dan en muchos otros países. Las diferencias serán menores en el caso de los países en los que una alta proporción de especies son endémicas (es decir, que solo se encuentran en ese país), como en muchas naciones insulares y países montañosos, especialmente en los trópicos. Las diferencias serán mayores en los países en los que una alta proporción de especies se distribuyen ampliamente en muchas naciones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Referencias&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Международная ассоциация по защите птиц (BLI) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Понятия и определения &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Определение: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Индекс Красной книги показывает изменение совокупного риска исчезновения по группам видов. Он основан на реальных изменениях количества видов в каждой категории риска исчезновения в Красной книге МСОП видов, находящихся под угрозой исчезновения (МСОП 2015), выражается в виде изменений индекса в диапазоне от 0 до 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Понятия: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Находящиеся под угрозой виды - это виды, внесенные в Красную книгу МСОП угрожаемых видов в категориях « В уязвимом положении&quot;, &quot;В опасности&quot; или &quot;В критической опасности&quot; (т. е. виды, находящиеся в дикой природе, которым грозит высокий, очень высокий или чрезвычайно высокий риск исчезновения в среднесрочной перспективе). Изменения в динамике по времени доли видов, которым угрожает исчезновение, в значительной степени обусловлены повышением компетентности и изменением систематизации. Показатель исключает такие изменения, чтобы получить более информативный показатель, а не простую долю видов, которые находятся под угрозой исчезновения. Таким образом, показатель отражает изменение совокупного риска исчезновения групп видов с течением времени в результате реального улучшения или ухудшения статуса отдельных видов. Его можно рассчитать для любого репрезентативного набора видов, которые не менее двух раз подвергались оценке на предмет включения в Красную книгу МСОП исчезающих видов (Butchart et al. 2004, 2005, 2007).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Источники данных &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Описание: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Национальные агентства, разрабатывающие соответствующие данные, включают правительство, неправительственные организации (НПО) и академические учреждения, работающие совместно и отдельно друг от друга. Данные собираются из опубликованных и неопубликованных источников, от экспертов, ученых, занимающихся определенными видами, и защитников природы посредством переписки, семинаров и электронных форумов. Данные предоставляются национальными агентствами в МСОП или собираются в рамках инициатив Партнерства Красной книги. С 2013 по 2016 годы Партнерство Красной книги включало: Международную ассоциацию по защите птиц (BLI); Международную организацию по охране ботанических садов; международную компанию, занимающуюся разработкой природоохранных технологий Conservation International; компанию &quot;Майкрософт&quot;; некоммерческую организацию NatureServe; Королевские ботанические сады, Кью; Римский университет Ла Сапиенца; Техасский механико-сельскохозяйственный университет; благотворительный фонд Wildscreen; и Зоологическое общество Лондона.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Процесс сбора: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; См. информацию в других категориях. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Календарь &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Сбор данных: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Красная книга МСОП видов, находящихся под угрозой исчезновения, обновляется ежегодно. Индексы Красной книги для любых наборов видов, которые были подвергнуты всестороннему пересмотру в этом году, обычно публикуются вместе с обновлением Красной книги МСОП. Данные хранятся и управляются в базе данных Службы информации о видах, а также предоставляются бесплатно для некоммерческого использования через веб-сайт Красной книги МСОП. Повторную оценку риска исчезновения необходимо проводить для каждого вида, включенного в Красную книгу МСОП угрожаемых видов, один раз в десять лет, а в идеале - один раз в четыре года. В Стратегическом плане Красной книги подробно описан календарь предстоящих пересмотров для каждой таксономической группы. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Выпуск данных: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Новые данные для Индекса Красной книги обычно становятся доступными каждый год. Например, первый Индекс Красной книги для саговников был выпущен в 2015 году, обновления Красной книги для птиц и млекопитающих будут выпущены в 2016 году, а обновления для хвойных пород и акул ожидаются в 2017 году.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Поставщики данных &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Национальные агентства, подготавливающие соответствующие данные, включают правительство, неправительственные организации (НПО) и академические учреждения, работающие совместно и отдельно друг от друга. Данные собираются из опубликованных и неопубликованных источников, от экспертов, ученых и защитников природы посредством переписки, семинаров и электронных форумов. Данные предоставляются национальными агентствами в МСОП или собираются в рамках инициатив Партнерства Красной книги.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Составители данных &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Название: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; МСОП &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Описание: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Разработка и представление отчетности по Индексу Красной книги на глобальном уровне проводится Международным союзом охраны природы (МСОП) и Международной ассоциацией по защите птиц (BLI) от имени Партнерства Красной книги. Исчерпывающая обобщающая Красная книга МСОП исчезающих видов была опубликована, например, Baillie и др. (2004г.) и Hoffmann и др. (2010г.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Обоснование: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; На мировые биологические виды влияет ряд угрожающих процессов, включая разрушение и деградацию среды обитания, чрезмерную эксплуатацию, инвазивные чужеродные виды, вмешательство человека, загрязнение и изменение климата. Этот показатель может использоваться для оценки общих изменений в факторах риска исчезновения групп видов в результате этих угроз и пределов, до каких эти угрозы могут снизиться.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Значение индекса Красной книги варьируется от 1 (все виды отнесены к категории &quot;Находятся под наименьшей угрозой&quot;) до 0 (все виды отнесены к категории &quot;Исчезнувший вид&quot;) и, таким образом, показывает, насколько близко категория видов приблизилась к исчезновению. Таким образом, Индекс Красной книги позволяет сравнивать категории видов как по их общему уровню риска исчезновения (то есть, насколько в общем они находятся под угрозой), так и по скорости, с которой этот уровень риска изменяется с течением времени. Тенденция к снижению индекса Красной книги с течением времени означает, что ожидаемые темпы исчезновения видов в будущем ухудшаются (т.е. темпы утраты биоразнообразия растут). Тенденция к росту означает, что ожидаемая скорость исчезновения видов снижается (т. е. темпы утраты биоразнообразия сокращаются), а горизонтальная линия означает, что ожидаемая скорость исчезновения видов остается неизменной, хотя в каждом из этих случаев происходящие процессы не означают, что потеря биоразнообразия остановлена. Тенденция к росту Индекса Красной книги будет указывать на то, что задача 15.5 ЦУР по сокращению деградации естественной среды обитания и защите находящихся под угрозой видов находится в процессе выполнения. Значение Индекса Красной книги, равное 1, будет означать, что процесс потери биоразнообразия остановлен.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Не следует использовать «Индекс Красной книги», чтобы подразумевать, что показатель создается в виде составного показателя ряда разрозненных показателей (таким же образом, как, например, скомпилирован многомерный индекс бедности). Индекс Красной книги представляет собой показатель тенденций риска исчезновения видов, который оценивается с использованием категорий и критериев Красной книги МСОП (Mace et al., 2008, IUCN 2012a) и составлен из данных по изменениям с течением времени в категории Красной книги для каждого вида, исключая любые изменения, обусловленные улучшенными знаниями или пересмотренной таксономией.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Индекс Красной книги используется в качестве показателя Стратегического плана в области сохранения биоразнообразия на 2011-2020 гг. (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al, 2014) и использовался в качестве показателя для цели Конвенции о биологическом разнообразии 2010 (Butchart et al., 2010) и цели 7 в области развития, сформулированной в Декларации тысячелетия. Его также можно рассчитать с целью оценки сценариев будущего развития (Visconti et al., 2015). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Комментарии и ограничения: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Существуют четыре основных источника неопределенности, связанных со значениями и тенденциями Индекса Красной книги. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Неадекватные, неполные или неточные знания о статусе вида. Эта неопределенность
сводится к минимуму путем отнесения оценок риска исчезновения к категориям, которые являются широкими по величине и срокам. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Задержки в знаниях о виде, становящихся доступными для оценки. Такие задержки
относятся к небольшой (и все уменьшающейся) части изменений статуса и их можно преодолеть в Индексе Красной книги путем ретроспективного пересчета.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Несоответствие между оценками видов. Их можно свести к минимуму с помощью
требования предоставить подтверждающую документацию с подробным описанием наилучших доступных данных с обоснованиями, источниками и оценками неопределенности и качества данных, которые подвергаются проверке и унификации экспертами МСОП при помощи органов Красной книги, Технической рабочей группы Красной книги и независимого подкомитета по стандартам и петициям. Кроме того, приветствуется использование подробного Руководства по применению категорий и критериев (IUCN SPSC 2016), а также проводятся учебные онлайн-курсы (на английском, испанском и французском языках). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Виды, о которых имеется слишком мало информации для применения критериев Красной
книги, относятся к категории &quot;Данных недостаточно&quot; и исключаются из расчета Индекса Красной книги. Что касается птиц, только 0,8% существующих видов оцениваются как относящиеся к категории &quot;Данных недостаточно&quot; по сравнению с 24% земноводных. Если виды, относящиеся к категории &quot;Данных недостаточно&quot;, различаются по скорости изменения риска их исчезновения, то Индекс Красной книги может дать предвзятую картину изменения риска исчезновения всей категории вида. Степень неопределенности, которую это вводит, оценивается с помощью процедуры «вытаскивания»/бутстреппинга, которая случайным образом присваивает каждому виду «Данных недостаточно» категорию, основанную на числе видов, не попадающих в категорию «Данных недостаточно», для каждой категории Красной книги для рассматриваемого набора видов, и повторяет процедуру для 1000 итераций, составляя 2,5 и 97,5 процентилей в качестве нижнего и верхнего доверительных интервалов для медианы.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Основное ограничение Индекса Красной книги связано с тем фактом, что категории Красной книги являются относительно широкими показателями оценки статуса, и, таким образом, Индекс Красной книги для любой отдельной таксономической группы может практически обновляться с интервалом не менее четырех лет. Поскольку общий индекс агрегирован по нескольким таксономическим группам, он обычно может обновляться ежегодно. Кроме того, Индекс Красной книги не особенно хорошо отражает ухудшение статуса обычных видов, которые все еще остаются многочисленными и широко распространенными, но их количество постепенно сокращается.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Методология &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Метод расчета: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Индекс Красной книги рассчитывается на определенный момент времени сначала умножением количества видов в каждой категории Красной книги на вес (в диапазоне от 1 для категории «Близки к уязвимому положению» до 5 для категории «Исчезнувший вид» и &quot;Исчезнувшие в дикой природе&quot;) и последующим сложением этих значений. Затем полученное значение делится на максимальную оценку угрозы, которая представляет собой общее количество видов, умноженное на вес, присвоенный категории &quot;Исчезнувший вид&quot;. Это окончательное значение вычитается из 1, чтобы получить значение Индекса Красной книги. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Математически этот расчет выражается как: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; RLIt = 1 &amp;#x2013; [(Ss Wc (t, s) / (WEX * N)] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Где Wc (t, s) - это вес для категории (c) в момент времени (t) для видов (вес для видов &quot;В критической опасности&quot; = 4, &quot;В опасности&quot; = 3, &quot;В уязвимом положении&quot;= 2, &quot;Близки к уязвимому положению&quot; = 1, &quot;Находятся под наименьшей угрозой&quot; = 0. Виды &quot;В критической опасности&quot;, помеченные как &quot;Возможно исчезнувший вид&quot; или &quot;Возможно исчезнувшие в дикой природе&quot;, имеют вес 5); WEX = 5, вес, присвоенный видам &quot;Исчезнувший вид&quot; или &quot;Исчезнувшие в дикой природе&quot; и N - общее количество оцененных видов, за исключением тех, которые были оценены как &quot;Данных недостаточно&quot; в текущий период времени, и тех, которые считаются &quot;Исчезнувший вид&quot; в год, когда была проведена первая оценка набора видов.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Формула требует, чтобы: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Точно такой же набор видов был включен во все периоды времени, и &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Единственными изменениями в категории Красной книги являются те, которые
являются результатом реального улучшения или ухудшения статуса (т. е. исключая изменения, являющиеся результатом улучшения знаний или таксономических пересмотров), и&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Виды категории &quot;Данных недостаточно&quot; были исключены &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Во многих случаях списки видов будут незначительно изменяться от одной оценки к другой (например, из-за таксономических изменений). Таким образом, эти условия могут быть выполнены путем ретроспективной корректировки более ранних категоризаций Красной книги с использованием текущей информации и таксономии. Это достигается за счет предположения, что текущие Категории Красной книги для таксонов применялись с тех пор, когда набор видов был впервые оценен для Красной книги, если нет информации об обратном, что произошли реальные изменения статуса. Такая информация часто бывает контекстной (например, относящейся к известной истории потери среды обитания в пределах ареала вида). Если информации о вновь добавленном виде недостаточно, он не включается в Индекс Красной книги до тех пор, пока он не будет оценен во второй раз, после чего более ранние оценки ретроспективно корректируются путем экстраполяции последних тенденций в популяциях, ареале, среде обитания и угрозах, подкрепленных дополнительной информацией. Чтобы избежать ложных результатов из-за предвзятого выбора видов, Индексы Красной книги обычно рассчитываются только для таксономических групп, в которых все виды во всем мире были оценены для включения в Красную книгу, или для образцов видов, которые попали в систематическую или случайную выборку.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Методы и научные основы Индекса Красной книги описаны Butchart et al. (2004, 2005, 2007, 2010). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Бутчарт и др. (2010) также описали методы, с помощью которых Индексы Красной книги для различных таксономических групп объединяются для создания единого мульти-таксонового Индекса Красной книги. В частности, агрегированные Индексы Красной книги рассчитываются как среднее арифметическое значение смоделированных Индексов Красной книги. Индексы Красной книги для каждой таксономической группы интерполируются линейно по годам между точками данных и линейно экстраполируются (с наклоном, равным наклону между двумя ближайшими оцененными точками), чтобы согласовать их с годами, для которых имеются Индексы Красной книги для других таксонов. Индексы Красной книги для каждой таксономической группы по каждому году моделируются с учетом различных источников неопределенности: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Недостаток данных: категории из Красной книги (от находящихся под наименьшей
угрозой до исчезнувших) присваиваются всем видам с недостающими данными, с вероятностью, пропорциональной числу видов в категориях с достаточным объемом данных для этой таксономической группы; &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; Неопределенность экстраполяции: хотя Индексы Красной книги были экстраполированы
линейно на основе наклона кривой между двумя ближайшими оцененными точками, существует неопределенность в отношении того, насколько точно может быть определен этот наклон. Чтобы учесть эту неопределенность, а не экстраполировать детерминированно, наклон, используемый для экстраполяции, выбирается из нормального распределения с вероятностью, равной наклону кривой между двумя ближайшими оцененными точками, и стандартным отклонением, равным 60% этого наклона (т. е. стандартное отклонение составляет 60%); &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; Временная изменчивость: истинный Индекс Красной книги, вероятно, меняется
из года в год, но поскольку оценки осуществляются только с многолетними интервалами, точное значение для любого конкретного года является неопределенным. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Чтобы сделать эту неопределенность явной, значение Индекса Красной книги для данной таксономической группы в данном году присваивается из скользящего окна в пять лет с центром в ключевом году (с набором окон в 3-4 года для первых двух и последних двух лет в серии). Обратите внимание, что неопределенность оценки еще не может быть включена в Индекс. На практике эти неопределенности включаются в агрегированные Индексы Красной книги следующим образом: Виды с недостаточными данными были отнесены к категории, как описано выше, а Индекс Красной книги для каждой таксономической группы был рассчитан путем интерполяции и экстраполяции, как описано выше. Окончательное значение Индекса Красной книги было присвоено каждой таксономической группе для каждого года из окна лет, как описано выше. В результате каждого такого прогона создавался Индекс Красной книги за полный период времени для каждой таксономической группы, включающий различные источники неопределенности. Для каждой таксономической группы проводится десять тысяч таких прогонов и вычисляется среднее значение.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ниже описаны методы формирования национальных дезагрегированных Индексов Красной книги. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Обработка отсутствующих значений: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt; На страновом уровне: &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Индексы Красной книги для каждой таксономической группы интерполируются линейно по годам между точками данных и линейно экстраполируются (с наклоном, равным наклону кривой между двумя ближайшими оцененными точками, за исключением кораллов) возвращаясь назад к самому раннему моменту времени и двигаясь вперед к настоящему времени к годам, по которым оценки недоступны. Начальный год агрегированного индекса устанавливается за десять лет до первого года оценки для таксономической группы с самой последней точкой начала. Кораллы не экстраполируются линейно, потому что, как известно, после 1996 года (из-за экстремального обесцвечивания) спад был намного сильнее, чем раньше. Таким образом, скорость снижения до 1996 года устанавливается как среднее значение скоростей для других таксономических групп. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt; На региональном и глобальном уровнях: &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Индекс Красной книги рассчитывается в глобальном масштабе на основе оценок риска исчезновения каждого из включенных в него видов, поскольку многие виды имеют области распространения, охватывающие многие страны. Таким образом, хотя, безусловно, существует неопределенность в отношении Индекса Красной книги, отсутствующих значений как таковых нет, поэтому вменение не требуется. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Региональные агрегаты: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Категории и критерии Красной книги применяются для каждого вида из Красной книги МСОП видов, находящихся под угрозой исчезновения, и устанавливаются на глобальном уровне, а также предлагаются к использованию в основном группами специалистов и отдельными органами Комиссии Красной книги МСОП по выживанию видов, инициативными группами под руководством Секретариата МСОП, партнерством Международной ассоциации по защите птиц (BLI) и другими партнерскими организациями Красной книги МСОП. Сотрудники Глобальной программы МСОП по видам собирают, проверяют и обрабатывают эти данные, а также несут ответственность за публикацию и распространение результатов. Оценка каждого отдельного вида обеспечивается путем применения стандартов метаданных и документации (IUCN 2013), включая классификации, например, угроз и природоохранных мероприятий (Salafsky et al. 2008). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Оценка Красной книги проводится либо на открытых семинарах, либо на открытых дискуссионных форумах в Интернете. Оценки проверяются соответствующим органом Красной книги (лицо или организация, назначенные Комиссией МСОП по выживанию видов для проверки оценок по конкретным видам или группам видов) для обеспечения стандартизации и согласованности в интерпретации информации и применении критериев. Техническая рабочая группа по Красной книге и Группа Красной книги МСОП работают над обеспечением последовательной категоризации между видами, группами и оценками. Наконец, Подкомитет по стандартам и петициям контролирует процесс и решает проблемы и споры, связанные с оценками из Красной книги.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Кроме того, МСОП публикует рекомендации по применению категорий и критериев Красной книги МСОП в региональном или национальном масштабе (МСОП 2012b). Исходя из этого, многие страны инициировали программы по оценке риска исчезновения видов, встречающихся внутри их границ. Эти страны смогут применять Индекс Красной книги, рассчитанный на основе национального риска исчезновения после того, как они составят по крайней мере две национальных Красных книги с использованием системы МСОП согласованным образом (Bubb et al. 2009). Все большее число стран в настоящее время производят национальные Индексы Красной книги для ряда таксонов (например, G&amp;#xE4;rdenfors 2010, Pihl &amp;amp; Flensted 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Хотя глобальные Индексы Красной книги можно дезагрегировать, чтобы показать тенденции для видов в меньших пространственных масштабах, но в обратную сторону процесс не производится. Национальные или региональные Индексы Красной книги не могут быть агрегированы для создания Индексов Красной книги, отражающих глобальные тенденции. Это связано с тем, что глобальный риск исчезновения таксона должен оцениваться в глобальном масштабе и не может быть напрямую определен из нескольких оценок в национальном масштабе по всему его ареалу (хотя данные таких оценок могут быть агрегированы для включения в глобальную оценку).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Доступные странам методы и руководства для составления данных на национальном уровне: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; См. существующие метаданные для показателя 15.5.1 ЦУР Красной книги, особенно раздел &amp;#x201C;Методология &amp;#x201D;. В итоге: данные, лежащие в основе Индекса Красной книги, составляются под руководством Комитета Красной книги МСОП с применением критериев категорий Красной книги МСОП (&lt;a href=&quot;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10315&quot;&gt;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10315&lt;/a&gt;). Это включает представление эндемиков из национальных процессов Красной книги, где они были проведены в соответствии с &amp;#x201C; Руководством по применению критериев Красной книги МСОП на региональном и национальном уровнях &amp;#x201D; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10336&quot;&gt;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10336&lt;/a&gt;) и следуя &amp;#x201C; Обязательной и рекомендованной вспомогательной информации для оценок Красной книги МСОП &amp;#x201D; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/O52euG&quot;&gt;http://goo.gl/O52euG&lt;/a&gt;). Оценки могут быть представлены на всех трех языках МСОП (английском, французском и испанском) и португальском. Все оценки проходят коллегиальную проверку через соответствующий орган Красной книги для рассматриваемого вида или группы видов, как указано в Правилах процедуры Красной книги (&lt;a href=&quot;https://cmsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/keydocuments/Rules_of_Procedure_for_IUCN_Red_List_Assessments_2017-2020.pdf&quot;&gt;https://cmsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/keydocuments/Rules_of_Procedure_for_IUCN_Red_List_Assessments_2017-2020 .pdf&lt;/a&gt;); см., в частности, Приложение 3, &amp;#x201C; Подробное описание шагов, включенных в процесс Красной книги МСОП &amp;#x201D; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://cmsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/keydocuments/Details_of_the_Steps_Involved_in_the_IUCN_Red_List_Process.pdf&quot;&gt;https://cmsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/keydocuments/Details_of_the_Steps_Involved_in_the_IUCN_Red_List_Process.pdf&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; См. существующие метаданные для показателя 15.5.1 ЦУР Индекса Красной книги, особенно раздел о &amp;#x201C;Методологии&amp;#x201D;. В итоге: ключевой документ, содержащий международные рекомендации и руководящие принципы для стран и всех, кто участвует в применении критериев категорий Красной книги МСОП (&lt;a href=&quot;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10315&quot;&gt;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10315&lt;/a&gt;) - это &amp;#x201C; Руководство по использованию категорий и критериев Красной книги МСОП &amp;#x201D; (на английском языке - &lt;a href=&quot;http://cmsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/RedListGuidelines.pdf&quot;&gt;http://cmsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/RedListGuidelines.pdf&lt;/a&gt; и на французском языке -&lt;a href=&quot;http://cmsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/keydocuments/RedListGuidelines_FR.pdf&quot;&gt;http://cmsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/keydocuments/RedListGuidelines_FR.pdf&lt;/a&gt;) вместе с &amp;#x201C;Требуемой и рекомендуемой вспомогательной информацией для оценок Красной книги МСОП&amp;#x201D;. Для стран (и регионов) это дополняется &amp;#x201C;Руководством по применению критериев Красной книги МСОП на региональном и национальном уровнях&amp;#x201D; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10336&quot;&gt;https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10336&lt;/a&gt;). Для поддержки расчета Индексов Красной книги для любой данной страны (или региона) в Интернете размещен &amp;#x201C;код R для расчета и построения национальных Индексов Красной книги, взвешенных на долю распространения каждого вида внутри страны или регионе.

В итоге: все оценки Красной книги проходят процедуру получения экспертного заключения в соответствующем органе Красной книги для рассматриваемых видов или групп видов; и все оценки Красной книги проходят проверки согласованности (для обеспечения согласованности с оценками, представленными для других таксономических групп, регионов, процессов и т. д.) отделом Красной книги перед публикацией на веб-сайте Красной книги (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iucnredlist.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.iucnredlist .org/&lt;/a&gt;). Наконец, председатель комиссии МСОП по выживанию видов (избирается каждые четыре года правительством и неправительственными членами МСОП) назначает председателя подкомитета по стандартам и петициям (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucn.org/theme/species/about/species-survival-commission/ssc-leadership-and-steering-committee/sub-committees/standards-and-petitions-subcommittee&quot;&gt;https://www.iucn.org/theme/species/about/species-survival-commission/ssc-leadership-and-steering-committee/sub-committees/standards-and-petitions-subcommittee&lt;/a&gt;, который отвечает за обеспечение качества и стандартов Красной книги МСОП и за рассмотрение петиций по включению видов в Красную книгу МСОП. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; В дополнение к распространению через веб-сайт Красной книги (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iucnredlist.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.iucnredlist.org/&lt;/a&gt;) данные Красной книги распространяются через Инструмент комплексной оценки биоразнообразия, доступный для исследования и сохранения в Интернете (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/&quot;&gt;https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/&lt;/a&gt;). Он включает документы странового профиля для всех стран мира, которые включают документацию по показателю Красной книги за текущий год, начиная с 2016 года. Первое издание каждого из этих страновых профилей было отправлено для консультации национальным координаторам Конвенции о биологическом разнообразии (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml&quot;&gt;https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml&lt;/a&gt;) на 13-м заседании Конференции Сторон Конвенции о биологическом разнообразии; и этот процесс будет повторяться ежегодно.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Доступность данных &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Описание: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Индекс Красной книги был классифицирован Межучрежденческой и экспертной группой по показателям достижения целей в области устойчивого развития (МЭГ-ЦУР) как Уровень 1. Текущие данные доступны по всем странам мира и обновляются на регулярной основе (примерно раз в четыре года). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Временные ряды: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; С 1980 года (примерно 35 лет). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Дезагрегирование: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Масштабность Индекса Красной книги может быть уменьшена для отображения национальных и региональных Индексов Красной книги, взвешенных на долю распространения каждого вида, находящегося в пределах страны или региона, основываясь на методе, опубликованном Rodrigues et al. (2014) PLoS ONE 9 (11): e113934. Они отражают индекс совокупной вероятности выживания (обратный риску исчезновения) для всех птиц, млекопитающих, амфибий, кораллов и саговников, встречающихся в стране или регионе. Индекс показывает, насколько хорошо виды сохраняются в стране или регионе по отношению к потенциальному вкладу в глобальное сохранение видов. Индекс рассчитывается как: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; RLI (t, u) = 1 &amp;#x2013; [(Ss (W (t, s) * (rsu / Rs)) / (WEX * Ss (rsu / RS)) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; где t - год всесторонней переоценки, u - пространственная единица (т.е. страна), W _ ((t, s)) - вес глобальной категории Красной книги для видов s в момент времени t (&quot;Находятся под наименьшей угрозой&quot; = 0 , &quot;Близки к уязвимому положению&quot; = 1, &quot;В уязвимом положении&quot; = 2,&quot; В опасности&quot; = 3, &quot;В критической опасности&quot; = 4, &quot;В критической опасности (возможно исчезнувшие)&quot; = 5, &quot;В критической опасности (возможно исчезнувшие в дикой природе)&quot; = 5, &quot;Исчезнувшие в дикой природе&quot; = 5 и &quot;Исчезнувший вид&quot; = 5 ), WEX = 5 - это вес исчезнувших видов, r_su - это доля от общего ареала видов s в единице u, а R_s - общий размер ареала видов s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Индекс изменяется от 1, если страна внесла минимальный вклад в глобальный Индекс Красной книги (т. е. если числитель равен 0, поскольку все виды в стране являются находящимися под наименьшей угрозой) до 0, если страна внесла максимально возможный вклад в глобальный Индекс Красной книги (то есть, если числитель равен знаменателю, потому что все виды в стране считаются исчезнувшими или возможно исчезнувшими). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; В таксономические группы включены виды, которые оценивались для включения в Красную книгу МСОП более одного раза. Категории Красной книги за годы, в которые проводились комплексные оценки (т. е. те, в которых были оценены все виды в таксономической группе), определяются в соответствии с подходом Butchart et al. 2007; PLoS ONE 2 (1): e140, т.е. они соответствуют текущим категориям, за исключением тех таксонов, которые подверглись действительному улучшению или ухудшению факторов риска исчезновения, достаточного для того, чтобы претендовать на более высокую или низкую категорию Красной книги.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Показатель также может быть дезагрегирован по экосистемам, средам обитания и другим политическим и географическим подразделениям (например, Han et al. 2014), по таксономическим подмножествам (например, Hoffmann et al. 2011), по группам видов, относящихся к конкретным международным договорам или законодательству (например, Croxall et al.2012), наборам видов, подверженных определенным угрожающим процессам (например, Butchart 2008), и наборам видов, которые предоставляют определенные экосистемные услуги или имеют определенные биологические или жизненные черты (например, Regan et al.2015). В каждом случае можно получить информацию из Красной книги МСОП угрожаемых видов, чтобы определить, какие виды относятся к определенным подмножествам (например, которые встречаются в определенных экосистемах, местообитаниях и географических районах, представляющих интерес). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Дезагрегирование Индекса Красной книги также имеет особое значение в качестве показателей для следующих задач ЦУР (Brooks et al. 2015): Индекс Красной книги ЦУР 2.4 (виды, используемые для производства продуктов питания и лекарств); Индекс Красной книги ЦУР 2.5 (дикие сородичи и местные породы); Индекс Красной книги ЦУР 12.2 (влияние использования) (Butchart 2008); Индекс Красной книги ЦУР 12.4 (воздействие загрязнения); Индекс Красной книги ЦУР 13.1 (последствия изменения климата); Индекс Красной книги ЦУР 14.1 (воздействие загрязнения на морские виды); Индекс Красной книги ЦУР 14.2 (морские виды); Индекс Красной книги ЦУР 14.3 (рифообразующие кораллы) (Карпентер и др., 2008); Индекс Красной книги ЦУР 14.4 (воздействие использования на морские виды); специальная совместная группа технических экспертов ФАО-МСОП в настоящее время работает над выработкой согласованных рекомендаций по использованию и интерпретации этого показателя; Индекс Красной книги ЦУР 15.1 (наземные и пресноводные виды); Индекс Красной книги ЦУР 15.2 (виды лесо-специалисты); Индекс Красной книги ЦУР 15.4 (горные виды); Индекс Красной книги ЦУР 15.7 (влияние использования) (Butchart 2008); и Индекс Красной книги ЦУР 15.8 (воздействие инвазивных чужеродных видов) (Butchart 2008, McGeoch et al. 2010). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Источники расхождений: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Некоторые страны оценили национальный риск исчезновения видов, встречающихся в стране, и повторили такие оценки, что позволило составить национальный Индекс Красной книги. Он может отличаться от показателя, описанного здесь, поскольку (а) он рассматривает национальный, а не глобальный риск исчезновения, и (б) потому что в нем не учитывается национальная ответственность за сохранение каждого вида, рассматривая как равные как те виды, которые не проживают нигде больше за пределами страны (то есть национальные эндемики), так и те, которые имеют большие ареалы, которые встречаются во многих других странах. Любые такие различия будут меньше для стран, в которых большая доля видов является эндемичной (то есть, встречающихся только в этой стране), как и во многих островных и горных странах, особенно в тропиках. Различия будут больше для стран, в которых большая доля видов имеет широкое распространение во многих странах. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Ссылки&lt;/h1&gt;
