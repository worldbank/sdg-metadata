	<data>&lt;p&gt;The challenge resulting from the flexible three-level approach to presenting a methodology is one of consistency and comparability. Can one compare between levels or across methods? Not directly and not without caveats. It is possible to compare at regional levels where the random error is relatively high (e.g. around 25%) for each country but it would not be appropriate to compare countries against each other unless there was a much greater difference in their estimates than the combined amount of error. The approach to consistency is one of transparency against a framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different methods of quantification can also be used for other relevant and related purposes (for example, &amp;#x201C;where are the greatest opportunities within the waste that is produced to reduce it?&amp;#x201D;). Taking in-home consumption as an example, it is difficult to obtain reasons for discarding food (and therefore the opportunities for influencing citizen behaviour) without the use of diaries or ethnography. However, direct weighing of waste volumes could give a significantly more accurate quantity.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
