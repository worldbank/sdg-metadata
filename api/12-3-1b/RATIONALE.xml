			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has emphasized the importance of sustainable production and consumption systems as efficient food systems, on the supply side and the consumption side, contribute to food security and sustainability of natural resource since agriculture is a major user of land and water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to an FAO publication in 2011, approximately one-third of all food is lost or wasted. This results in economic loss and increased pressure on food systems. Reducing food waste is critical to maximizing the value of agricultural land and ensuring that natural resources are used in a sustainable way. This indicator will not only help countries identify where food is lost and wasted but it can also provide information which Governments, citizens, and the private sector can use to reduce food waste.&lt;/p&gt;
