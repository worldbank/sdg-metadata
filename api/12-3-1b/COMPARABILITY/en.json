Additionally, there are a number of challenges related to the following:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Variations in waste over time can have a significant impact on estimated quantities of waste when short studies (e.g. a week) are used to represent a longer time period (a year)</li>\n  <li>The specific time of year when a study takes place which may affect the waste produced;</li>\n  <li>Natural variation over time in amounts of waste generated by single entities (e.g. households or restaurants). </li>\n  <li>At a national level, countries may have to rely on other entities to measure their own waste and report to the government, which would then be collated and analysed to estimate the total amount. How the data is collected would vary by the food chain stage as the way food waste is generated in each stage varies. For example, a large formal retailer (supermarket chain) may keep records of stock unsold and discarded which could be reported. On the other hand, a government requesting reporting from households may have to issue guidance to local municipalities and prescribe a quantification method e.g. a food waste diary. The reported quantities may require scaling if a government cannot obtain reports from the entire population of the food chain stage i.e. it is unlikely that every household in the country would report.</li>\n</ul>"}
