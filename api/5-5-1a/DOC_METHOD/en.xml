	<message>The DOC_METHOD field for indicator 5-5-1a, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Guidance is not required to provide information for this indicator (i.e. current number of members and the total number of women members in a given single or lower chamber of a national parliament).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &amp;#x201C;Checklist for Parline Correspondents&amp;#x201D; is provided to remind parliaments to inform the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) of changes to the number of seats or the total number of women in a parliamentary chamber, every time there is a change.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
