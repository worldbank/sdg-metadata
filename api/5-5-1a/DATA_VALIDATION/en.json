Their main role is to make sure that all the data in Parline for their parliament is up&#x2011;to&#x2011;date and correct, including for this indicator. If no response is provided to questionnaires, other methods are used to obtain the information, such as from the electoral management body, parliamentary web sites or Internet searches. Additional information gathered from other sources is regularly crosschecked with parliaments. </p>"}
