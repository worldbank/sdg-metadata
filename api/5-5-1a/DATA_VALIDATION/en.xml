	<message>The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 5-5-1a, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;IPU member parliaments provide information on changes and updates to the IPU secretariat via IPU Groups within each parliamentary chamber or via the Parline Correspondent&amp;#x2019;s Network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parline Correspondents are staff members of national parliaments who act as the IPU focal point for IPU&amp;#x2019;s Parline database within each chamber or parliament. Their main role is to make sure that all the data in Parline for their parliament is up&amp;#x2011;to&amp;#x2011;date and correct, including for this indicator. If no response is provided to questionnaires, other methods are used to obtain the information, such as from the electoral management body, parliamentary web sites or Internet searches. Additional information gathered from other sources is regularly crosschecked with parliaments. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
