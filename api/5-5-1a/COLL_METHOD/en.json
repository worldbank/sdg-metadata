National parliaments also transmit their data to the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) at least once a year and when the numbers change significantly. IPU member parliaments provide information on changes and updates to the IPU secretariat. After each general election or renewal, a questionnaire is dispatched to parliaments to solicit the latest available data. If no response is provided, other methods are used to obtain the information, such as from the electoral management body, parliamentary websites, or Internet searches. Additional information gathered from other sources is regularly crosschecked with parliament. </p>"}
