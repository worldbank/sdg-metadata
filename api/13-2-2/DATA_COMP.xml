			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Total GHG emissions are calculated as the sum of emissions of direct GHGs: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), measured in units of CO2-equivalent, by using a common weighting factor, the so-called Global Warming Potentials (GWP). In accordance with the latest reporting guidelines for Annex I Parties under the UNFCCC, the GWP values to be used are those for the 100-year time horizon listed in Table 2.14 of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar4/wg1/). However, non-Annex I Parties should use the GWP provided in the IPCC Second Assessment Report (https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ipcc-second-assessment-full-report/) based on the effects of GHGs over a 100-year time.&lt;/p&gt;
