	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data is limited to Parties that submit their GHG inventories. As the reporting requirements for non-Annex I Parties are not as rigid as those for Annex I Parties, information for these Parties are available usually only for selected years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The annual timing of submission of updated inventory reports is very close to publication date of annual SDG progress reports.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
