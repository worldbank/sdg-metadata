	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 1-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Different local characteristics of what constitutes &amp;#x201C;basic services&amp;#x201D; around the world by some concerned authorities and stakeholders compelled the team to work on modules and global guides for this indicator. This draws on definitions available for many other SDG indicators. For example, elements of basic services are measured under indicators 3.8.1 (health), 4.1.1 (education), 6.1.1 (drinking water), 6.2.1 (sanitation and hygiene), 7.1.1 (energy), 11.2.1 (public transport), etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, many countries still have limited capacities for data management, data collection and monitoring, and continue to struggle with limited data. This means that complementarity in data reporting in a few exceptions is needed to ensure that both national and global figures achieve consistencies in the final reported data for access to basic services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the original reference metadata for each of the measures for more details.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
