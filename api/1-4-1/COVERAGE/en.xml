	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 1-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data for a large set of indicators such as drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, energy and information are readily available and already included in different international household survey frameworks. Refinement of definitions of different types of basic services and inclusion of the newly developed survey items in the existing household surveys was completed. Data compilation has shown that more than 143 countries have data at the national level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time series data are produced for the periods running from 1990 to present. This is available based on the richness of the data sources for each indicator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disaggregation by geographic location (urban/rural, sub-national regions, etc.) and by socioeconomic characteristics (wealth, education, ethnicity, etc.) is possible in a growing number of indicators and countries (see further details in metadata for each indicator). However, the dashboard does not provide disaggregated data for each individual indicator.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
