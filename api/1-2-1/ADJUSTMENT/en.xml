	<message>The ADJUSTMENT field for indicator 1-2-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Adjustsments are made to the national poverty rates from EU-SILC, in the sense that the national poverty rate reported by Eurostat for year x is reported as year x-1 here. The reason is that the income data used by EU-SILC refers to year x-1 (indiviuals in year x are asked about their income the prior year).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
