{"status":"success","message":"The COVERAGE field for indicator 2-1-1, translated into en","data":"<p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>\n<p>Since 2017 FAO has reported separate estimates of PoU for 160 countries. </p>\n<p>While country-level estimates are presented as three-year averages, regional and global estimates are yearly estimates. </p>\n<p><strong>Time series: </strong></p>\n<p>2000 - current </p>\n<p><strong>Disaggregation: </strong></p>\n<p>Due to reliance on national Food Balance Sheets data to estimate mean caloric consumption levels in the population, the global monitoring of MDG Target 1C and of the WFS target has been based on estimates of the PoU at national level only. </p>\n<p>In principle, the indicator can be computed for any specific population group, provided sufficient accurate information exists to characterize the model&#x2019;s parameters for that specific group, that is, if data on the group&#x2019;s food consumption levels, age/gender structure and &#x2013; possibly &#x2013; physical activity levels, exist. </p>\n<p>The scope for disaggregation thus crucially depends on the availability of surveys designed to be representative at the level of sub national population groups. Given prevailing practice in the design of national household surveys, sufficient reliable information is seldom available for disaggregation beyond the level of macro area of residence (urban-rural) and of the main Provinces/Divisions in a country. To the extent that most of the used surveys are designed to accurately capture the distribution of income, inference can be drawn on the PoU in different income classes of the population. Gender disaggregation is limited by the possibility to identify and group households by gender-related information (such as sex of the head of the household, or male/female ratio).</p>"}
