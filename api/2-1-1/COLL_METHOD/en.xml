	<data>&lt;p&gt;Official information on food commodity production, trade and utilization used by FAO to compile Food Balance Sheets is provided mainly by Statistical Units of the Ministry of Agriculture. FAO sends out a data collection questionnaire every year to an identified focal point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microdata of household surveys are generally owned and provided by National Statistical Agencies. When available, data is sourced by FAO directly through the NSA&amp;#x2019; website. In several cases, when microdata is not available in the public domain, bilateral agreements have been signed, usually in the contexts of technical assistance and capacity development programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on the population size and structure for all monitored countries is obtained from the UN Population Division&amp;#x2019;s World Population Prospects. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
