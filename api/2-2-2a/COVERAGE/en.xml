&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At country level, JME country modelled estimates from 2000 to the year before the JME release ) are presented for countries with at least one data point (e.g., from survey/surveillance included in the joint database of primary data sources.
