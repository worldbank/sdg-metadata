The JME country modelled estimates are generated using smoothing techniques and covariates (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30430613/\">McLain et al. 2018</a>) applied to quality-assured national data to derive trends and up-to-date estimates. Worldwide and regional estimates are derived as the respective country averages weighted by the countries&#x2019; under-five population estimates (UNPD-WPP latest available edition) using annual JME country modelled estimates. </p>"}
