	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 2-2-2a, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;National estimates from primary sources (e.g., from household surveys) used to generate the JME modelled estimates are based on standardized methodology using the WHO Child Growth Standards as described in &lt;em&gt;Recommendations for data collection, analysis and reporting on anthropometric indicators in children under 5 years old&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://data.unicef.org/resources/data-collection-analysis-reporting-on-anthropometric-indicators-in-children-under-5/&quot;&gt;WHO/UNICEF 2019&lt;/a&gt;) and WHO Anthro Survey Analyser (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/tools/child-growth-standards/software&quot;&gt;WHO, 2019&lt;/a&gt;). The JME country modelled estimates are generated using smoothing techniques and covariates (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30430613/&quot;&gt;McLain et al. 2018&lt;/a&gt;) applied to quality-assured national data to derive trends and up-to-date estimates. Worldwide and regional estimates are derived as the respective country averages weighted by the countries&amp;#x2019; under-five population estimates (UNPD-WPP latest available edition) using annual JME country modelled estimates. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
