			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Data consistency and quality checks described above are conducted for each potential primary data source (e.g., household survey) before inclusion in the JME country database of primary sources that are used to generate the JME modelled estimates. Cross-validation exercises are performed for the modelled estimates to ensure the method generates estimates that are aligned to national data points. Country consultations with SDG 2.2 focal points an held every other year also provide opportunity to ensure the estimates include all recent and relevant country data. &lt;/p&gt;
