	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 17-7-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Various definitions of &amp;#x2018;environmentally sound technology&amp;#x2019; exist and are in use. Terms such as &amp;#x2018;environmental technology&amp;#x2019;, &amp;#x2018;clean technology&amp;#x2019;, &amp;#x2018;and cleantech &amp;#x2019;or &amp;#x2018;low-carbon technology&amp;#x2019; are sometimes used, although low-carbon technology can be considered as a sub-set of green technology. Other less commonly used terms include climate-smart and climate-friendly technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional limitations include: different baseline years in numerous available databases, and the different purposes of available databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many national statistical systems lack the capacity to compile information on &amp;#x201C;Total amount of approved funding to promote the development, transfer, dissemination and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies&amp;#x201D;. Compiling data on this indicator presents a challenge in terms of consistent definitions and approaches. However, this methodology recognizes these difficulties and provides an approach that can allow a comparability among countries.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
