&lt;p&gt;States refer to the ICAO Reference Manual on the Statistics Programme (Doc 9060) to compile and file traffic reports at a national level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Road/Rail/Inland waterways/Pipelines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metadata (explanations of coverage, breaks in series etc.) for the ITF and UNECE inland transport data are available through their respective online databases. The aforementioned Glossary for Transport Statistics provides definitions for passenger-km and tonne-km, but also for related terms such as what constitutes a passenger, the definitions and exclusions within each transport mode etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maritime:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries do not systematically collect or report data on international maritime freight and container port traffic. UNCTAD relies on data published by industry and information published by specialized sources. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
