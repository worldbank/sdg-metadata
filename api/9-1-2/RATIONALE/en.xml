	<data>&lt;p&gt;Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and trans-border infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all. Trans-border infrastructure development is best captured by passenger and freight volumes moved by Member States and Regions. A growth in passenger and freight volumes shows a robust infrastructure development happening in States and Regions along with the resultant socio-economic benefit. Air Transport is particularly important not only for the economic and job benefits but also because it is one of the only mode of transport that can be relied on during emergencies and disease outbreaks to reach food, medicines, medical personnel, vaccines and other supplies speedily to the affected persons in the affected areas. In addition, tracking how the non-road share of freight volumes, and the public transport share of passenger volumes, changes over time allows insights into the overall sustainability of the global transport system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aviation:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Informed decision-making is the foundation upon which successful businesses are built. In a fast-growing industry like aviation, planners and investors require the most comprehensive, up-to-date, and reliable data. ICAO&amp;#x2019;s aviation data/statistics programme is to provide accurate, reliable and consistent aviation data so that States, international organizations, aviation industry, tourism and other stakeholders can make better projections. The UN recognized ICAO as the central agency responsible for the collection, analysis, publication, standardization, improvement and dissemination of statistics pertaining to civil aviation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maritime:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume of international maritime freight and container port traffic movements provide an overall indication of the importance of port infrastructure for trade and development and may be relied upon to infer the quality and adequacy of seaports and their hinterland connections. Maritime transport is the dominant mode of international freight transport when flows are measured in volume terms. Behind the global and regional headline estimates, individual contributions vary by region and type of cargo, reflecting, among other factors, differences in countries&amp;#x2019; economic structures, composition of trade, urbanization, levels of development, extent of integration into global trading networks, degree of participation in global supply chains, and the quality of transport infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World container port traffic reflects the importance of containerized trade and countries&amp;#x2019; participation in global liner shipping networks and globalized manufacturing production processes.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
