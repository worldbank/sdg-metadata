	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aviation: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official aviation statistics are reported on a regular basis by Member States to ICAO through Air Transport Reporting Forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maritime:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data not based on a systematic reporting by countries and relies mainly on secondary sources that may vary over time. Official reporting by countries is very limited. Some data is only available at regional or sub-regional level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNCTAD secretariat is currently collaborating with a specialized data provider and UN-DESA to elaborate a standard methodology that is based on UN Comtrade data to generate annual data on maritime freight flows, at country level and for all UN member countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Maritime cargo movements are counted only once regardless of whether the transhipment port is located within the same country or not &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Road, Rail, Inland waterways, Pipelines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official transport statistics are reported on a regular basis by Member States to UNECE and ITF through questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
