Significant correspondence is undertaken with the countries over potential errors, and common issues and challenges are discussed at both the ITF annual statistics meeting and the UNECE&#x2019;s annual Working Party on Transport Statistics.</p>\n<p>A common problem for many countries is that passenger-km are only collected for public transport.
