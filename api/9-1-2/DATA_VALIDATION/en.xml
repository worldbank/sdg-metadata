&lt;p&gt;ICAO Statistics Programme has put in place a series of robust data quality control functions to automate all the necessary calculations and producing a report for each reporting form. These quality control processes were divided into two main activities: verification and validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maritime:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNCTAD secretariat monitors, collects, and compiles the data at the country level as well as at regional/sub-regional level. It continuously updates the data as new data and information becomes available. Some commercial providers of maritime statistics publish global data that is derived, for example, from shipping contracts, and UNCTAD compares its own data with those published by commercial providers. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
