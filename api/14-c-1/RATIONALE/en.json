{"status":"success","message":"The RATIONALE field for indicator 14-c-1, translated into en","data":"<p>Target 14.c seeks to enhance the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources by implementing international law as reflected in UNCLOS.</p>\n<p>UNCLOS sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out, including the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources. It is a framework instrument, which provides for the development of other instruments that conform to the provisions of the Convention. Therefore, progress in the implementation of international law as reflected in UNCLOS can only be comprehensively measured if progress in the implementation of ocean-related instruments that in turn implement international law as reflected in UNCLOS, is also measured. </p>\n<p>Such instruments include, in particular, UNCLOS&#x2019;s two implementing agreements - the Agreement relating to the implementation of Part XI of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (Part XI Agreement) and the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (UNFSA). </p>\n<p>Accordingly, following extensive consultation with Member States and other stakeholders, the methodology for indicator 14.c.1 measures the number of countries making progress in ratifying, acceding to and implementing UNCLOS, the Part XI Agreement and UNFSA through legal, policy and institutional frameworks. </p>\n<p>Data collected through the first administration of the questionnaire, which is based on the indicator, will provide a baseline of the current state of ratification of, accession to and implementation of UNCLOS and its two implementing agreements. Subsequent indicator-based data will then show progress made by countries.</p>\n<p>Countries that do not respond to the questionnaire, or do not approve the use of their responses to the questionnaire, will not receive indicator scores.</p>"}
