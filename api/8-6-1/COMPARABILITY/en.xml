	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 8-6-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;A number of factors can limit the comparability of statistics on the youth NEET rate between countries or over time. When differing from international standards, the operational criteria used to define employment and the participation in education or training will naturally affect the comparability of the resulting statistics, as will the coverage of the source of statistics (geographical coverage, population coverage, age coverage, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
