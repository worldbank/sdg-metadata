	<message>The DOC_METHOD field for indicator 8-6-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;To calculate this indicator, reliable data are needed on both the labour market situation and the participation in the educational system of the youth. These data are collected at the national level mainly through labour force surveys (or other types of household surveys with an employment module). For the methodology of each national household survey, one must refer to the most comprehensive survey report or to the methodological publications of the national statistical office in question. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
