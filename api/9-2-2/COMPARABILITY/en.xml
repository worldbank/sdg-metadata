	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 9-2-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work statistics for countries not using the same set of statistical standards are not comparable. As such, each series is based on a single set of standards (i.e., 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; or 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; ICLS) and contains only data comparable within and across countries, allowing data users to continue making meaningful time series analysis and international comparisons. Users should not compare data across series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other differences may arise due to: a) discrepancies in data sources; b) ISIC Revision used by a country; c) informal employment; d) coverage of data source (geographical coverage, economic activities covered, types of establishments covered, etc.); e) working-age population definition.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
