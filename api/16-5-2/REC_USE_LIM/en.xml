	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 16-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The key strength of the Enterprise Survey is that most of the questions in the survey pertain to the actual, day-to-day experiences of the firm; these questions regarding corruption are not opinion-based question but rather are grounded in the firm&amp;#x2019;s day-to-day reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limitations include that some countries&amp;#x2019; data is almost 10 years old (e.g. Burkina Faso and Brazil). This is due to the fact that these face-to-face survey projects can be expensive in some countries and hence due to budget limitations, the World Bank hasn&amp;#x2019;t been able to update some of the Enterprise Surveys data in a subset of countries. Another limitation is that the surveys are done mostly in World Bank client countries and hence several high-income countries are not covered by the surveys (US, Canada, UK, Singapore, Japan, GCC countries, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another limitation may be the sensitive nature of corruption. In some countries/cultures, firms may not be comfortable answering questions on corruption. Although the data is collected under the context of confidentiality, firms may refuse to answer the question if they have been subject to bribery solicitations. Hence, in some countries, the actual incidence of this particular type of corruption may be higher than the calculated indicator value.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
