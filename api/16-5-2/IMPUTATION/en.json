A single point estimate is created for each country and a global/regional aggregate takes a simple average of every country&#x2019;s point estimate (when there is available data for that country). For example the East Asia Pacific average (point estimate) for the indicator does not include Japan since there is no Enterprise Survey for Japan.</p>"}
