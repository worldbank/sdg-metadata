	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 6-b-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Defining the procedures in policy or law for the participation of local communities is vital to ensure the needs of all the community are met, including the most vulnerable and also encourages ownership of schemes which in turn contributes to their sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A low value of this indicator would suggest that participation of local communities in water and sanitation management is low, whereas a high value would indicate high levels of participation, indicating greater ownership and a higher likelihood of sustainable delivery and management of water and sanitation services.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
