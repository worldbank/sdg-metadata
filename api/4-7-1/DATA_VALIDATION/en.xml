	<message>The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 4-7-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Responses are reviewed by UNESCO for consistency and credibility and, if necessary, queries are raised with national respondents. Where feasible, reference is made to national documents and links supplied by respondents and to available alternative sources of information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any proposed changes in response values in the questionnaire as a result of quality assurance procedures are communicated and verified with countries by UNESCO. Final results are shared before publication by UNESCO with the national data providers and with national SDG indicator focal points where they exist.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
