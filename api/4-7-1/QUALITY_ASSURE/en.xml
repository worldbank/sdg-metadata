	<data>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UNESCO reviews country responses for consistency and credibility and, if necessary, raises queries with national respondents. To assist with this, countries are asked to provide, in addition to completed questionnaires, supporting evidence of their responses in the form of documents or links (e.g. to education policies, laws, curricula, etc.). These will be made publicly available during 2022 along with completed questionnaires. UNESCO also takes into account alternative sources of information, where available. These may include national responses to similar intergovernmental consultation processes, such as the Council of Europe&amp;#x2019;s consultations on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coe.int/en/web/edc/2016-report-analysis&quot;&gt;Charter on Education for Democratic Citizenship and Human Rights Education&lt;/a&gt;, the UN Economic Commission for Europe&amp;#x2019;s consultations on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unece.org/env/esd/implementation.html&quot;&gt;Strategy for Education for Sustainable Development&lt;/a&gt;, or other information on education for sustainable development (ESD) and global citizenship education (GCED) in countries&amp;#x2019; national education systems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any proposed changes to response values in the questionnaire as a result of quality assurance procedures are communicated to and verified with countries by UNESCO. Final results are shared before publication by UNESCO with the national data providers and SDG indicator focal points. &lt;/li&gt;
