To assist with this, from 2020, countries will be asked to provide, in addition to completed questionnaires, supporting evidence of their responses in the form of documents or links (e.g. to education policies, laws, curricula, etc.). These will be made publicly available along with completed questionnaires after results are published. UNESCO will also take into account alternative sources of information, where available. These may include national responses to similar intergovernmental consultation processes, such as the Council of Europe&#x2019;s consultations on the <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/edc/2016-report-analysis\">Charter on Education for Democratic Citizenship and Human Rights Education</a>, the UN Economic Commission for Europe&#x2019;s consultations on the <a href=\"http://www.unece.org/env/esd/implementation.html\">Strategy for Education for Sustainable Development</a>, or other information on ESD and GCED in countries&#x2019; national education systems. </li>\n  <li>Any proposed changes to response values in the questionnaire as the result of quality assurance procedures will be communicated to and verified with countries by UNESCO. Final results will be shared with countries before publication (i) by UNESCO with the national data providers and (ii) by the UIS with education statistics and SDG indicator focal points as part of its annual SDG indicator verification exercise. </li>\n</ul>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
