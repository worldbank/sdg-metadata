	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 16-b-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rationale:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pledge to leave no-one behind and eliminate discrimination is at the centre of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The elimination of discrimination is also enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the core international human rights treaties. The purpose of this indicator is to measure a prevalence of discrimination based on the personal experience reported by individuals. It is considered an outcome indicator (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Indicators/Pages/documents.aspx&quot;&gt;HR/PUB/12/5&lt;/a&gt;) helping to measure the effectiveness of non-discriminatory laws, policy and practices for the concerned population groups.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
