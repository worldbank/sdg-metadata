After checking and validating the results, the national responsible entity submits the questionnaire to FAO. Upon receipt of the questionnaire, FAO will undertake a quality check, and revert to the national responsible institution in case clarifications or revisions are needed. FAO will then compute the indicator based on the information supplied by countries and communicate the results to the UN SDGs Secretariat.&lt;/p&gt;
