	<data>&lt;p&gt;All countries are able to start reporting on the first year, as the source of data (the laws and policies in force when the assessment takes place) are publicly available in all of them and &amp;#x201C;measuring&amp;#x201D; the indicator is done by conducting a legal analysis. Moreover, the assessment can be conducted by a legal expert in a very short timeframe (about 15 days).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
