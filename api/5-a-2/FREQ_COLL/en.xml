	<message>The FREQ_COLL field for indicator 5-a-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;As policy and law reforms usually take a long time, countries should report on this indicator only &lt;strong&gt;every four years&lt;/strong&gt;. However, if countries that have already submitted their report experience legal reforms that change their scores, those countries should send to FAO an updated questionnaire with the revised assessment for quality control and re-classification in the band system.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
