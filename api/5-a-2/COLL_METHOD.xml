			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of the official reporting at the global level, ONLY the proxies localized in the primary and/or secondary law will be reported because of their binding nature. The only exception to this rule is Proxy D where also national wide programs are considered for the purpose of the assessment. However, for the meaningfulness of the assessment, relevant policies are considered for the analysis because they represent the foundations of the law setting out the principles that indicate the direction towards which the country aims to move and very often suggest reforms that need to be adopted in the legal framework. In this sense, if the proxies are present in these types of instruments they constitute an important step towards a more gender sensitive legal framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data are extracted directly from the laws in force at the moment when the assessment is carried out. Data collection/provision entails the assessment of the relevant laws to determine if the six proxies are present or not in the legal framework. Data will be compiled in an electronic questionnaire organized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 1: General Instructions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022;. Respondant Information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; Instructions for filling the questionnaire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 2: Legal Assessment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022;. Checklist of policy and legal instruments relevant for the assessment in order to guide the expert in the identification of the proxies in the policy and legal framework of the country analysed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022;. Form 1 &amp;#x201C;Policy and legal instruments, including provisions for Proxy (x)&amp;#x201D;. This form composed of a set of questions to be answered (YES or No) to determine if the proxy is present. The details of the instruments containing the Proxy are to be provided in this form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022;. Form 2 &amp;#x201C;results of Assessment &amp;#x2013; Proxy (x)&amp;#x201D;. This form summarizes the results of the assessment for each proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 3: Summary of the Assessment (Country Results)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To complete the indicator 5.a.2 assessment, national legal experts must examine the national legal and policy framework and complete the electronic questionnaire following the methodological guidelines. This involves three steps that must be repeated for each proxy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Collect all the relevant policy and legal documents, using the checklist contained in the electronic questionnaire as a guide as to the instruments to check for the concerned proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Using the detailed methodological guidelines, determine whether the proxy exists in the legal and policy framework and in which instruments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Complete the questionnaire for each proxy, citing the instrument and the relevant provisions where the proxy was located as well as any further relevant information or exception. Include a hyperlink to the text of the legal and policy instrument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these three steps have been undertaken for all six proxies the national responsible institution will identify the level of protection to women&amp;#x2019;s land rights present in the legal framework according to the number of proxies located. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filled questionnaire will be communicated to FAO for the quality control and global reporting to the UN SDGs Secretariat.&lt;/p&gt;
