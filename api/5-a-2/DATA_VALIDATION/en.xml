	<data>&lt;p&gt;As with all the SDG targets and indicators, the monitoring and reporting process for target 5.2 a is global in scope and country-led. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAO provides technical support to the designated focal point(s) and national legal expert to carry out the assessment and fill the questionnaire. To facilitate the process FAO also shares with them relevant materials, including the methodological guidelines &amp;#x201C;Realizing women&amp;#x2019;s rights to land in the law&amp;#x201D; (https://www.fao.org/3/i8785en/I8785EN.pdf), the questionnaire and the e-learning platform (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=364&quot;&gt;https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=364&lt;/a&gt;). The key materials currently exist in English, French, Spanish, and Arabic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the assessment has been finalized, the responsible institution submits the questionnaire to FAO for quality control to ensure that the assessment fulfil the criteria and thresholds established in the methodology. The reviewed questionnaire is sent back to the country for validation and official submission. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
