	<message>The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 5-a-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;As with all the SDG targets and indicators, the monitoring and reporting process for target 5.a is global in scope and country-led. For this reason, FAO make substantial efforts for ensuring countries&amp;#x2019; commitment and ownership for the reporting process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAO provides support to the national legal expert and designated focal point(s) from the nominated responsible institution for SDG indicator 5.a.2 to carry out the assessment and fill the questionnaire closely following the methodological guidelines prepared by FAO. To facilitate the process FAO also shares with them relevant materials, including the methodological guidelines &amp;#x201C;Realizing women&amp;#x2019;s rights to land in the law&amp;#x201D;, the questionnaire and the e-learning (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=364&quot;&gt;https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=364&lt;/a&gt;). These materials currently exist in English, French and Spanish. When the assessment has been finalized the responsible institution submit the questionnaire to FAO for the quality control. FAO&amp;#x2019; s focal point for the indicator and legal experts review the report against the criteria set in the methodology for each proxy. The reviewed questionnaire is then sent back to the the country for validation. There are as many iterations as needed until an agreement is reached so that the results are consistent with the methodology.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
