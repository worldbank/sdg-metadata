For this reason, FAO makes substantial efforts to ensure countries&#x2019; commitment to and ownership of the reporting process.</p>\n<p>FAO provides technical support to the national legal expert and designated focal point(s) from the nominated responsible institution for SDG indicator 5.a.2 to carry out the assessment and fill the questionnaire. To facilitate the process FAO also shares with them relevant materials, including the methodological guidelines &#x201C;Realizing women&#x2019;s rights to land in the law&#x201D;, the questionnaire and the e-learning platform (<a href=\"https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=364\">https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=364</a>). These materials currently exist in English, French and Spanish, whereas the Arab and Russian translation will be available in 2022. When the assessment has been finalized the responsible institution submits the questionnaire to FAO for quality control. FAO&#x2019; s focal point for the indicator and legal experts review the report against the criteria set in the methodology for each proxy. The reviewed questionnaire is then sent back to the country for validation. There are as many iterations as needed until an agreement is reached so that the results are consistent with the methodology.</p>"}
