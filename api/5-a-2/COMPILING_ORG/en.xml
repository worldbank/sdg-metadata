	<message>The COMPILING_ORG field for indicator 5-a-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;FAO is responsible for compilation and reporting on this indicator at the global level. After checking and validating the results, the responsible national entity submits the questionnaire to FAO. Upon receipt of the questionnaire, FAO will undertake a quality check, and revert to the responsible national institution in case clarifications or revisions are needed. FAO will then compute the indicator based on the information supplied by countries and communicate the results to the UN SDGs Secretariat.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
