This may result in users interpreting these aggregates as pertaining to all countries in the region, which is the equivalent of treating countries with missing data as if they were the same as those for which data are available.</p>\n<p>In the first reporting period, we can only measure and report the shares of countries in each of the 6 bands. This first reporting period will also serve as the baseline against which future progress will be measured.</p>\n<h2>Obtaining internationally comparable data for global monitoring:</h2>\n<p>As noted above delegated national institutions will be responsible for undertaking the legal assessment at the national level. It is recommended that the results of the final assessment are shared widely and validated by a cross-section of relevant institutions before final submission to FAO.</p>\n<p>The legal assessments should be conducted closely following the detailed methodological guidelines &#x201C;Realizing women&#x2019;s rights to land in the law&#x201D;. FAO will conduct a quality review to ensure compliance with the methodology. The methodology ensures the robustness and comparability of the data collected at the national level </p>\n<p>The initial legal research for developing the methodology and its piloting process in different regions/contexts was invaluable in delineating the threshold of each proxy and ensuring that countries are treated equitably under the methodology in terms of the different ways in which the proxies may appear in national legislation. A good example of this is proxy B, spousal consent for land transactions, as the methodology establishes the type of legal provisions meeting the proxy&#x2019;s threshold with specific reference to the three different marital regimes &#x2013; separate, partial community or community property. Similarly, the methodology provides clear guidance on how to treat legal regimes that do not provide for private ownership &#x2013; by providing examples of what type of &#x2018;ownership&#x2019; would equate the equivalent to a freehold estate under systems where all land is owned by the state.</p>"}
