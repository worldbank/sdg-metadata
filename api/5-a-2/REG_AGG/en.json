Once 50% of the countries of a particular region has officially reported, the mean/average score for an SDG region will be calculated without weighting national scores. The region will be classified into a particular band reflecting the extent to which the relevant national laws recognise and protect women&#x2019;s rights to land. The same applies to the global aggregation which will be calculated based on the unweighted regional average/mean score, once 50% of the regions have been classified in a particular band. </p>"}
