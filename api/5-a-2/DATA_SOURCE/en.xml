	<message>The DATA_SOURCE field for indicator 5-a-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Governments should nominate a national entity responsible for the process of monitoring and reporting on indicator 5.a.2. The designation of the responsible institution should be guided by nature of the information required in particular relevant provisions from land and family laws. In view of this, the most adequate national institutions that could be designated for having this responsibility are land related institutions (i.e. Ministries of Land or the national institution governing land matters), and/or the national gender institution (i.e. Gender Equality Commissions, Women&amp;#xB4;s Affairs or Gender Ministries).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
