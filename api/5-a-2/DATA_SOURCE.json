The concerned indicator has three important features that should guide Government&#x2019;s decision in the selection of the institution that will have the responsibility for the monitoring of tis indicator: the legal nature of the indicator, land tenure aspects and gender/women&#x2019;s rights. In view of this, the most adequate national institutions that could be designated for having this responsibility are land related institutions (i.e. Ministries of Land or the national institution governing land matters) or a national gender institution (i.e. Gender Equality Commissions, Women&#xB4;s Affairs or Gender Ministries). Alternatively, a national institution with responsibility for upholding the rule of law such as the Ministries of Justice or Human Rights Commissions would be also appropriate.</p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
