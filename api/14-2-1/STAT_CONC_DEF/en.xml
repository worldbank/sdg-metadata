	<data>&lt;p&gt;Definition: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional Seas Coordinated Indicator 22 &amp;#x2018;Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) is proposed as the primary indicator. For countries with Marine/Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) in place, these plans can be helpful to assess ICZM. For other countries, it is important to identify ways to measure existing plans and to build capacity for integrated planning. All data for this indicator will be based on country submissions to the Regional Seas Programme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to promote the use of the Regional Seas as part of the follow-up and review mechanism for the Regional Seas, UNEP drafted report on how Regional Seas data could be directly used for the SDGs (see https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/27295/ocean_SDG.pdf?sequence=1&amp;amp;isAllowed=y).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full methodology for this indicator is available in the document entitled, &amp;#x201C;Global Manual on Ocean Statistics for Measuring SDG 14.1.1, 14.2.1 and 14.5.1&amp;#x201D;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concepts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICZM &amp;#x2013; An Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) plan covers the entire coastal zone. Marine and terrestrial areas are managed together. Plans are developed through coordination across different marine and terrestrial institutions and agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) &amp;#x2013; Marine Spatial Planning is focused on the EEZ. It the integrates the needs and policies of multiple marine sectors in one coherent planning framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EEZ - national Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (200 nautical miles from the coast) as outlined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
