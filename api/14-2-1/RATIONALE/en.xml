	<data>&lt;p&gt; Oceans are an important part of the global system and covering more than 70 per cent of the Earth&amp;#x2019;s surface. They provide food and livelihoods for billions of people, absorb atmospheric heat and more than a quarter of carbon dioxide, and produce about half of the oxygen in the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to human activities, global climate change and environmental problems have led to threats to marine ecosystems and environments. It is important to identify ways to measure existing plans and to build capacity for integrated planning.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
