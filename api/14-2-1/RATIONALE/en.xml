	<data>&lt;p&gt;From an ecological perspective, ecosystem approaches consider the connections between the living organisms, habitats, physical and chemical conditions within an ecosystem, focusing on the importance of ecological integrity, biodiversity and overall ecosystem health. From a management perspective, ecosystem-based approaches refer to integrated management strategies for socio-ecological systems that consider ecological, social and economic factors and apply principles of sustainable development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A marine or coastal area-based (or spatial) management promotes better management of EEZs. Many countries use Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) and Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) as their approach for ensuring appropriate ecosystem-based management, including issues that are cross-sectoral and wider scale in nature.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
