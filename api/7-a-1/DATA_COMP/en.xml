	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 7-a-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The OECD flows are calculated by taking the total official flows (ODA and OOF) from DAC member countries, multilateral organisations and other providers of development assistance to the sectors listed above. The IRENA (additional) flows are calculated by taking the total public investment flows from IRENA&amp;#x2019;s Public Renewable Energy Investment Database and excluding: domestic financial flows; international flows to countries outside developing regions; international flows to multilateral recipients not elsewhere specified; and flows reported by OECD (as described above). The flows are commitments measured in current United States Dollars (USD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flows are tracked by individual commitment or activity level. When there are duplicate commitments between the OECD and IRENA databases, these are excluded from the IRENA database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flows are converted to constant USD at a base year that normally has a two-year lag behind the publication year. The computation uses the DAC deflator methodology explained by the OECD on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/informationnoteonthedacdeflators.htm&quot;&gt;web site&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
