	<message>The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 17-1-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The actual and recommended sources of data for deriving this indicator are the fiscal statistics reported to the IMF&amp;#x2019;s Statistics Department. These come from various national agencies (Ministries of Finance, Central Banks, National Statistics Offices, etc.) and are compiled according to a standardized method for data collection: the annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/gfs/manual/gfs-qtca.htm&quot;&gt;GFS Questionnaire&lt;/a&gt;. In the 2020 annual reporting cycle, approximately 130 countries reported the relevant series for monitoring indicator 17.1.1. For current non-reporting countries that have demonstrated the capacity to compile and report the relevant GFS revenue series, the IMF Statistics Department is engaged in outreach to the national authorities, in consultation with the respective IMF Area Departments and Offices of the Executive Director, as needed. Capacity Development activities will seek to address data deficiencies, including through regional workshops. The steps outlined above should allow, over time, for covering virtually the entire IMF membership.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
