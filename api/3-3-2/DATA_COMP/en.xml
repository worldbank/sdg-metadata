	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 3-3-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Estimates of TB incidence are produced through a consultative and analytical process led by WHO and are published annually. These estimates are derived from annual case notifications, assessments of the quality and coverage of TB notification data, national surveys of the prevalence of TB disease, national inventory studies and information from death (vital) registration systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the period 2000-2019, estimates of incidence for each country are derived using one or more of the following approaches, depending on available data: (i) incidence = case notifications/estimated proportion of cases detected; (ii) capture-recapture modelling, (iii) incidence = prevalence/duration of condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2020 and 2021 specifically, these methods were retained for most countries. However, for countries with large absolute reductions in the reported number of people newly diagnosed with TB in 2020 or 2021 relative to pre-2020 trends (which suggested major disruptions to access to TB diagnosis and treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic), dynamic models were used in replacement of the methods used for 2000-2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty bounds are provided in addition to best estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Details are provided in the technical appendix on methods used by WHO to estimate the global burden of tuberculosis disease published alongside the most recent WHO global tuberculosis report at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/data&quot;&gt;https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/data&quot;&gt;programme/data.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</data>
