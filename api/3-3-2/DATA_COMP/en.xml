	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 3-3-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Estimates of TB incidence are produced through a consultative and analytical process led by WHO and are published annually. These estimates are based on annual case notifications, assessments of the quality and coverage of TB notification data, national surveys of the prevalence of TB disease and information from death (vital) registration systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimates of incidence for each country are derived, using one or more of the following approaches depending on available data: (i) incidence = case notifications/estimated proportion of cases detected; (ii) capture-recapture modelling, (iii) incidence = prevalence/duration of condition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty bounds are provided in addition to best estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details are available from TB impact measurement: policy and recommendations for how to assess the epidemiological burden of TB and the impact of TB control (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241598828) and from the online technical appendix to the WHO global tuberculosis report at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/data&quot;&gt;https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
