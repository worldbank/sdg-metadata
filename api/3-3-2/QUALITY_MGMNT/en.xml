	<data>&lt;p&gt;All health statistics published by WHO undergo a systematic internal review process from the Data Division, including TB burden statistics. External review of specific statistics is conducted in various ways, including through country consultations and reviews by technical review bodies such as the WHO Global Task Force on TB Impact Measurement. A report of a 2022 review by a subgroup of the Task Force is available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240057647&quot;&gt;https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240057647&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
