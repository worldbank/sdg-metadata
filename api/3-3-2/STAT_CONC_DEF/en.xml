	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis (TB) incidence is defined as the estimated number of new and relapse TB cases (all forms of TB, including cases in people living with HIV) arising in a given year. It is usually expressed as a rate per 100 000 population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Concepts:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct measurement requires high-quality surveillance systems in which underreporting is negligible, and strong health systems so that under-diagnosis is also negligible; otherwise, indirect estimates are produced, using either a) notification data combined with estimates of levels of underreporting and under-diagnosis, b) inventory studies combined with capture-recapture modelling, c) population-based surveys of the prevalence of TB disease or d) dynamic models fitted to monthly/quarterly notification data. Dynamic models are only used for selected countries in which major drops in TB case notifications compared with pre-2020 trends suggest major reductions in access to TB diagnosis and treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
