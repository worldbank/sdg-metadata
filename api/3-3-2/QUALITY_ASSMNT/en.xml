	<message>The QUALITY_ASSMNT field for indicator 3-3-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;TB surveillance data are assessed systematically through so-called epidemiological reviews, which provide data quality scores used to update plans for strengthening TB surveillance and used in models to estimate the burden of TB. In addition, the data are reviewed internally for consistency. Data and estimates are published in the form of country profiles used in systematic consultations with countries, as mentioned in previous sections and cited in section 7. Results are published in detail in publicly available annual global TB reports&lt;/p&gt;</data>
