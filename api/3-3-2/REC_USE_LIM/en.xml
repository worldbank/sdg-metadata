	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 3-3-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;TB incidence has been used for over a century as a main indicator of TB burden, along with TB mortality. The indicator allows comparisons over time and between countries. Improvement in the quality of TB surveillance data result in reduced uncertainty about indicator values. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</data>
