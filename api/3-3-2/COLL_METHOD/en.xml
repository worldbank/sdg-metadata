	<data>&lt;p&gt;National Tuberculosis (TB) Programmes report their annual TB data to WHO every year between April and June using a standardized web-based data reporting system maintained at WHO. The system includes real-time checks for data consistency. Estimates of TB burden are prepared in July-August and shared with countries for review in August-September; revisions are made based on feedback received. In selected countries with new survey data, estimates are updated separately during the year. The final set of estimates is reviewed in WHO before publication in October, for compliance with specific international standards and harmonization of breakdowns for age and sex groups.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
