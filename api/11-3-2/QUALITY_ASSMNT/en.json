Both components are captured in the reporting template shared with National Statistical Offices, which helps to assess whether computation was done using the proposed indicator inputs or proxies. The reporting template also requests for information that helps understand whether national data for the indicator was produced from a representative sample of the country&#x2019;s urban systems, or if estimates were done for only select cities/urban areas where data is easily available. </p>"}
