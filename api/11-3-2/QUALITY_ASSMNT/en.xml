	<message>The QUALITY_ASSMNT field for indicator 11-3-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Once data is received from member states, UN-Habitat uses a checklist specific to each indicator to assess a) whether the data production process followed the metadata provisions, and b) confirm the accuracy of the data sources used for the indicator computation. Both components are captured in the reporting template shared with National Statistical Offices, which helps to assess whether computation was done using the proposed indicator inputs or proxies. The reporting template also requests for information that helps understand whether national data for the indicator was produced from a representative sample of the country&amp;#x2019;s urban systems, or if estimates were done for only select cities/urban areas where data is easily available. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
