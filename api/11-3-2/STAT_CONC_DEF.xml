&lt;p&gt;Civil society organizations (CSOs) make a difference in international development. They provide development services and humanitarian relief, innovate in service delivery, build local capacity and advocate with and for the poor. Acting alone, however, their impact is limited in scope, scale and sustainability. CSOs need to engage in government policy processes more effectively. The development of sustainable human settlements calls for the active engagement of all key stakeholders with particular attention to project/programme beneficiaries and vulnerable groups. Therefore local and national governments should strive to: a) facilitate and protect people&amp;#x2019;s participation and civic engagement through independent civil society organizations that can be from diverse backgrounds - local, national, and international; b) promote civic and human rights education and training programmes to make urban residents aware of their rights and the changing roles of diverse women, men, and young women and men in urban settings; c) remove the barriers that block participation of socially marginalized groups and promote non-discrimination and the full and equal participation of women, young men and women and marginalized groups. To monitor this indicator fully, it is important to define cities as unique entities and define what constitutes direct participation structures of civil society. Urban planning and management are more clear concepts that UN-Habitat has worked on developing for the last few decades and these are well articulated in the urban agenda documents. Experts who have worked on the methodological developments of this indicator have there put forth the below definitions to help guide the work on this indicator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concepts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many urban related SDGs require global monitoring with the &amp;#x2018;city&amp;#x2019; as the unit of analysis. In order to monitor the urban SDGs in particular, it is necessary to agree on a global/common definition of what constitutes a &amp;#x2018;city&amp;#x2019;. A standard city definition will assist in the monitoring of the SDGs by ensuring that the study areas for the spatial urban SDGs are standardized and easily reproducible, and will add clarity to the methodologies and approaches to the collection of data to support the land and rural related indicators. UN-Habitat in collaboration with New York University and European Commission&amp;#x2019;s Joint Research Centre has adopted two definitions of cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;City as defined by its Urban extent (built-up and urbanized open space) - New York University&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urban extent is defined as the total area occupied by the built-up area and the urbanized open space. The built-up area is defined as the contiguous area occupied by buildings and other impervious surfaces, but excluding urbanized open space, both public and private, as well as vacant lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landsat imagery&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-2&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is used to identify and classify the built-up pixels into 3 types depending on the share of built-up density (urbanness) in a 1-km2 circle of a given building:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Urban built-up area: built-up pixels where the walking distance circle has a built-up density greater than 50%. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suburban built-up area: built-up pixels where the walking distance circle has a built-up density between 25%-50%. It also includes subdivided land, whether it is wholly unbuilt or not.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rural built-up area: built-up pixels where walking distance circle has a built-up density of less than 25% and that are not on subdivided land. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The urbanized open space (mainly refers to unbuilt areas including open countryside, forests, crop fields, parks, unbuilt urban areas, cleared land) is classified into 3 types:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fringe open space consists of all open space pixels within 100 meters of urban or suburban pixels;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Captured open space consists of all open space clusters that are fully surrounded by urban and suburban built-up pixels and the fringe open space pixels around them, and that are less than 200 hectares in area; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rural open space consists of all open spaces that are not fringe or captured open spaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fringe open space and captured open space together, make up the urbanized open space in a given study area. In other words, the urban extent consists of all the buildings and the small open space areas (&amp;lt;200 ha) that are surrounded by buildings and the open space fringe that is within 100 meters of urban and suburban areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;City as defined by its Degree of Urbanisation (DEGURBA) - European Commission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Degree of urbanisation (DEGURBA) is a classification that indicates the character of an area. Based on the share of the local population living in 3 different types of clusters, local administrative units (LAUs) are classified into three types of area: thinly populated area (rural area); intermediate density area (towns and suburbs/small urban area), and densely populated area (cities/large urban area) following a 2-step procedure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a first step, grid cells of 1 km2 are classified into one of the three following clusters, according to their population size and density:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High-density cluster/urban centre: contiguous grid cells of 1 km2 with a density of at least 1 500 inhabitants per km2 and a minimum population of 50 000;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Urban cluster: cluster of contiguous grid cells of 1 km2 with a density of at least 300 inhabitants per km2 and a minimum population of 5 000;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rural grid cell: grid cell outside high-density clusters and urban clusters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second step, local administrative units are then classified into one of three types of areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Densely populated area (alternative names: cities or large urban area): at least 50 % live in high-density clusters; in addition, each high-density cluster should have at least 75 % of its population in densely-populated LAUs; this also ensures that all high-density clusters are represented by at least one densely-populated LAU, even when this cluster represents less than 50 % of the population of that LAU;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Intermediate density area (alternative name: towns and suburbs or small urban area): less than 50 % of the population lives in rural grid cells and less than 50 % live in high-density clusters;Thinly populated area (alternative name: rural area): more than 50 % of the population lives in rural grid cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democratic participation: Structures allow and encourage participation of civil society representing a cross-section of society that allows for equal representation of all members of the community with equal rights for participation and voting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct participation: Structures allow and encourage civil society accessing and actively engaging in decision-making, without intermediaries, at every stage of the urban planning and management process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular participation: Structures allow and encourage civil society participation in urban planning and management processes at every stage, and at least every six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marginalized groups: Groups of people that are not traditionally given equal voice in governance processes. These include, but are not limited to, women, young men and women, low-income communities, ethnic minorities, religious minorities, people with disabilities, the elderly, and sexual and gender identity minorities and migrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structures: Any formal structure that allows for participation of civil society. This can include, but is not limited to national or local legislation, policy, town council meetings, websites, elections, suggestion boxes, appeals processes, notice period for planning proposals etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Civil Society: The combination of non-governmental organizations, community groups, community-based organizations, regional representative groups, unions, research institutes, think tanks, professional bodies, non-profit sports and cultural groups, and any other groups that represent the interests and wills of the members and wider community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urban Management: The officials, including elected officials and public servants, that are responsible for city-management, across all sectors, such as roads, water, sanitation, energy, public space, land title etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urban Budget decision making: The process by which money is allocated to various sectors of urban management, including roads, roads, water, sanitation, energy, public space, land title etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urban Planning, including Design and Agreements: The technical and political process that concerns the development and use of land, how the natural environment is used etc. Design includes over-arching and specific design of public space, as well as zoning and land use definitions. Agreements refer to specific contract/arrangements made with various groups in regard to their land, e.g. Indigenous groups, protected natural environments etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-2&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; Landsat Imagery is made up of several spectral bands that can be used to identify impervious surfaces roughly corresponding to built-up areas, making it possible to classify them by human-assisted algorithms into three classes with a high degree of accuracy. &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
