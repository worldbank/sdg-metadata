Tariffs can be used to create a price advantage for similar locally-produced goods and for raising government revenues. Trade remedy measures and taxes are not considered to be tariffs. Tariff in HS chapters 01-97 is taken into consideration.</p>\n<p>Tariff line or National Tariff lines (NTL): National Tariff Line codes refer to the classification codes, applied to merchandise goods by individual countries that are longer than the HS six digit level. Countries are free to introduce national distinctions for tariffs and many other purposes.</p>\n<p>The national tariff line codes are based on the HS system but are longer than six digits. For example, the six digit HS code 010120 refers to Asses, mules and hinnies, live, whereas the US National Tariff line code 010120.10 refers to live purebred breeding asses, 010120.20 refers to live asses other than purebred breeding asses and 010120.30 refers to mules and hinnies imported for immediate slaughter.</p><p>The main information used to calculate indicators 17.12.1 is import tariff data. Information on import tariffs might be retrieved by contacting directly National statistical offices, permanent country missions to the UN, regional organizations or focal points within the customs, ministries in charge of customs revenues (Ministry of economy/finance and related revenue authorities) or, alternatively, the Ministry of trade. Tariff data for the calculation of this indicator are retrieved from ITC (MAcMap) - http://www.macmap.org/ - WTO (IDB) - http://tao.wto.org - and UNCTAD (TRAINS) databases. Import tariff data included in the ITC (MAcMap) database are collected by contacting directly focal points in line national agencies or regional organizations (in the case of custom unions or regional economic communities). When available, data are downloaded from national or regional official websites. In some cases, data are purchased from private companies. Import tariff data included in the WTO (IDB) database are sourced from official notifications of WTO members. Import tariff included in the UNCTAD (TRAINS) database are collected from official sources, including official country or regional organizations websites.</p><p>Continuously updated all year round</p><p>Indicatively the indicator&#x2019;s calculations can be ready by March every year.

Accurate estimates on non-tariff measures do not exist, thus the calculations on market access are limited to tariffs only.</p>\n<p>A full coverage of preferential schemes of developed countries has been used for the computation, but preferential treatment may not be fully used by developing countries&apos; exporters for different reasons such as the inability of certain exporters to meet eligibility criteria (i.e., complying with rules of origin).&quot;</p><p>Some tariff rates which are not expressed in ad valorem form (e.g., specific duties) need to be converted in ad valorem equivalents (i.e. in per cent of the import value). The conversion is made at the tariff line level for each importer by using the unit value method. Import unit values are calculated from import values and quantities. Only a limited number of non-ad valorem tariff rates (i.e. technical duties) cannot be provided with ad valorem equivalents (AVE) and are excluded from the calculation. This methodology also allows for cross-country comparisons.</p><p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>\n<p>Missing values are calculated using the most recent year available.</p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>\n<p>Answered under question 11.1</p><p>This fixed weighting scheme, referred to as &quot;Standard Import Structure&quot; is the same for all developed market imports originating from developing countries and least developed countries.
