&lt;p&gt;Protected area data are aggregated globally into the WDPA by UNEP-WCMC, according to the mandate for production of the United Nations List of Protected Areas (Deguignet et al. 2014). They are disseminated through Protected Planet, which is jointly managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC 2016). KBAs data are aggregated into the WDKBA, managed by BirdLife International (2019). &lt;/p&gt;</data>
