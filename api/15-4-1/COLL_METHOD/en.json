Guidance on Proposing, Reviewing, Nominating and Confirming KBAs is available in KBA Secretariat (2019) at <a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/assets/35687f50ac0bcad155ab17447b48885a\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/assets/35687f50ac0bcad155ab17447b48885a</a>.</p>\n<p>The KBA identification process is highly inclusive and consultative: anyone with data on the biodiversity importance of a site may propose it as a KBA if it meets the <a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2016-048.pdf\">KBA criteria</a>, and consultation with stakeholders at the national level (both non-governmental and governmental organisations) is required during the proposal process. Any site proposal must undergo independent review. This is followed by the official site nomination with full documentation meeting the Documentation Standards for KBAs. Sites confirmed by the KBA Secretariat to qualify as KBAs are then published on the KBA Website.</p>\n<p>Submission of proposals for KBAs to the WDKBA follows a systematic review process to ensure that the KBA criteria have been applied correctly and that the sites can be recognised as important for the global persistence of biodiversity. Regional Focal Points have been appointed to help KBA proposers develop proposals and then ensure they are reviewed independently. Guidance on Proposing, Reviewing, Nominating and Confirming sites has been published to help guide proposers through the development of proposals and the review process, highlighting where they can obtain help in making a proposal. </p>"}
