	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 11-5-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The Sendai Framework Monitoring System has been developed to measure the progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework by UNGA endorsed indicators. Member States will be able to report through the System from March 2018. The data for SDG indicators will be compiled and reported by UNISDR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proxy, alternative and additional indicators:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases international data sources only record events that surpass some threshold of impact and use secondary data sources which usually have non uniform or even inconsistent methodologies, producing heterogeneous datasets.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
