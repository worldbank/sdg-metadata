{"status":"success","message":"The IMPUTATION field for indicator 14-4-1, translated into en","data":"<p><strong>&#x25CF; At regional and global levels</strong></p>\n<p>To ensure completeness of regional and global information on stocks, FAO gathers additional information outside of what is provided by each country, in particular concerning the highly migratory and straddling fishing stocks. For shared stocks, FAO may consult with Regional Fisheries Bodies (RFBs), who are mandated to assess and manage stocks with their contracting parties, in order to receive information and data and conduct stock assessment when necessary. </p>\n<p><strong>&#x25CF; At country level</strong></p>\n<p>This indicator examines marine fish stocks. If a country has no marine capture fisheries, then the indicator is not calculated for that country and FAO reports it to UNSD with the flag &#x201C;N&#x201D; (Not relevant). When data is missing at national level, no imputation is performed to derive estimates. The estimation of the indicator at regional and global levels was estimated not based on country questionnaires, but by the FAO through a systematic assessment of a reference list selected globally. </p>"}
