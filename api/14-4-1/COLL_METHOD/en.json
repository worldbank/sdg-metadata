For the purposes of using the best available data and information and maintaining consistency among stocks and assessors, a procedure has been defined to identify stock status information (FAO 2011). </p>\n<p>National: </p>\n<p>FAO collects national data through a questionnaire sent to the Principal Focal Point (PFP) of each country. The PFP organises an institutional set-up which identifies the competent authorities to develop a reference list of stocks and completes the questionnaire. The information or data collected through the questionnaire from a country will initially only inform individual country progress, also acknowledging the need for a learning curve along the few first questionnaire inquiries. Depending on the evolution and further standardization of country reporting over the next 3-5 years, national data may be used to inform global/regional estimates. </p>"}
