	<data>&lt;p&gt;Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Target 14.4: By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indicator 14.4.1: Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2021-02-01&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indicator 14.7.1: Sustainable fisheries as a percentage of GDP in small island developing States, least developed countries and all countries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fisheries Division&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Office of the Chief Statistician&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator, Proportion of marine fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels, measures the sustainability of the world&amp;apos;s marine capture fisheries by their abundance. A fish stock whose abundance is at or greater than the level that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as biologically sustainable. In contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY level, the stock is considered biologically unsustainable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSY is defined as the greatest amount of catch that can be harvested continuously from a stock under constant and current environmental conditions (e.g., habitat, water conditions, species composition and interactions, and anything that could affect birth, growth, or death rates of the stock) without affecting the long-term productivity of the stock. The indicator measures the sustainability of fish resources based a good balance between human use and ecological conservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSY-based reference points are the most common type of reference points used in fisheries management today. This is primarily because, for decades, reference points from surplus production models have most often been set based on the concept of MSY and they are the basic benchmarks for the sustainability of fisheries set by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, Article 61(3)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concepts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish stock refers to a group of individuals of a single species or sometimes combined species living in a defined area from which catches are taken in a fishery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reference list of stocks should be established by each country and consists of a list of stocks selected according to FAO guidelines, against which the indicator will be reported (Appendix 1). The reference list should include national and shared stocks but not straddling stocks as defined below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National stocks are located completely within an EEZ and/or territorial waters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shared stocks are distributed within the EEZ and/or territorial waters of two or more adjacent countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Straddling stocks are found to move across boundaries between EEZ waters or between EEZ and high seas (e.g. tuna stocks), and that are caught by multiple countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries are asked to report on stocks listed in its reference list, including those monitored through official stock assessments by an authoritative agency, through a scientific process and using best available science and data. These assessments could be based on classic or data-limited methods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock assessment uses biological information, fishery data such as catch statistics and fishing effort, and scientific survey data to estimate population dynamics of fish stocks for management purposes. Stock assessment methods include biological dynamic models, age-structured models, length-based methods and stock recruitment models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proportion (percentage).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FAO Major Fishing Areas for Statistical Purposes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASFIS List of Species for Fishery Statistics Purposes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNFSA Stock Jurisdictional distribution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FIRMS typology of stock units&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MSY-based reference point is often established through a formal stock assessment process. The data to inform stock assessments can come from many different sources, including fishery-dependent and fishery-independent sources. Fishery-dependent data are collected from the fishery itself, using both commercial and recreational sources through reporting or sample-based surveys at sea, at landing sites, or within fishing communities. Data from these sources are generally compiled into fisheries statistics. They can include information on removals of fish from the sea, which can include landings and discards, and information on the fleet such as number of boats, number of tows, time spent on the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisheries-independent are obtained in ways not related to any fishing activity and are typically collected by scientists via surveys (often scientific cruises) designed to sample species abundance and biomass over long time series, and over consistent seasons and geographic areas. Typically, fisheries-independent data collect biological information on the species (age, length, weight, maturity, etc.), and habitat and environmental information (temperature, salinity, depth, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three primary categories of data inputs are required for stock assessment, including data on life history traits, and time series of catch and fishing effort. Stock abundance is often not known and relative abundance or indices are often used to reflect historical changes in population size. These data can be sourced from fishery-independent surveys, e.g. acoustic or trawl-based sampling, or from fishery-dependent estimates using catch and effort data. Life history parameters provides information on individual growth and stock productivity e.g. fish size, age, reproductive rates, and natural mortality. Catch is the amount of fish removed from a stock by all types of fishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global/Regional:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the high data demands of classical stock assessment methods, only a limited number of fish stocks have been assessed. These species account for 17&amp;#x2013;25 percent of the global catch (Branch et al., 2011), and most are caught by fisheries in developed countries. To balance the global representativeness of the assessment results and the goal of using the best available information, the FAO uses a wide spectrum of data and methods to extend its assessment to the fish stocks that account for the majority (70-80 percent) of the global catch (FAO, 2005).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For country reporting, a questionnaire was sent out to all FAO member States with marine boundaries (i.e. 165 States) in 2019, and will be resent in 2021, and then on a two-year basis. For the complete list of questions used to inform this indicator, please refer to Appendix 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global/regional: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fish stocks that FAO has monitored since 1974 represent a wide spectrum of data availability, ranging from data-rich and formally assessed stocks to those that have very little information apart from catch statistics by FAO major fishing area and those with no stock assessment at all. For the purposes of using the best available data and information and maintaining consistency among stocks and assessors, a procedure has been defined to identify stock status information (FAO 2011). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAO collects national data through a questionnaire sent to the Principal Focal Point (PFP) of each country. The PFP organises an institutional set-up which identifies the competent authorities to develop a reference list of stocks and completes the questionnaire. The information or data collected through the questionnaire from a country will initially only inform individual country progress, also acknowledging the need for a learning curve along the few first questionnaire inquiries. Depending on the evolution and further standardization of country reporting over the next 3-5 years, national data may be used to inform global/regional estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National : Reporting every 2 years, i.e., 2020, 2021, 2023, 2025, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global/regional: every 2 years, i.e. &amp;#x2026;, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National: biennially. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global/regional: biennially&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FAO provides global and regional data. National-level data are generally reported by the National Statistics Office or the Ministry of Fisheries and/or Agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FAO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article I of the FAO constitution requires that the organization collect, analyses, interpret and disseminate information relating to nutrition, food and agriculture (the term &amp;#x201C;agriculture&amp;#x201D; and its derivatives includes forestry, fisheries and aquaculture, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/3/K8024E/K8024E.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/3/K8024E/K8024E.pdf&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first session of the FAO Conference in 1945 provided the basis and rationale for the FAO mandate as a custodian agency of this indicator: &amp;#x201C;If FAO is to carry out its work successfully it will need to know where and why hunger and malnutrition exist, what forms they take, and how widespread they are. Such data will serve as a basis for making plans, determining the efficacy of measures used, and measuring progress from time to time.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA [UN, 1995]) and the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (FAO, 1995a) all require maintaining or restoring fish stocks at levels that are capable of producing their maximum sustainable yield (MSY). To fulfil the objectives of these international treaties, fishery management authorities need to undertake assessment of the state of fish stocks and develop effective policies and management strategies. As a UN Agency with a mandate for fisheries, FAO endeavour to provide the international community with the best information on the state of marine fishery resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 1974, FAO has been periodically assessing and reporting the state of marine fishery resources using a wide spectrum of methods from numerical models to data poor approaches. FAO global and regional estimates were also used as an MDG indicator for Goal 7 on environment during the period 2000-2015. This facilitated its approval as a Tier I SDG indicator by the 2nd IAEG-SDG in October 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator has a peculiar nature compared to more conventional SDG indicators. The indicator estimates the sustainability of fish stocks that often move across national boundaries. This led the indicator to be initially reported only at global and regional levels, with regions not corresponding to continental MDG or SDG regions but to marine regions termed &amp;#x201C;FAO Major Fishing Areas&amp;#x201D;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Global SDG Indicator Framework is a voluntary mechanism, but countries are required to report if data are available. As a custodian agency, the FAO works to put in action the 2030 Agenda&amp;#x2019;s emphasis on country ownership and higher the incentive to take actions at country, regional and global levels. FAO has developed, since 2018, a questionnaire approach to allow individual countries to report on the sustainability of fish stocks. The approach 1) provides a framework for meaningful country-level reporting that complements but does not alter the core methodology of SDG indicator 14.4.1 at the global/regional levels (FAO, 2011), and 2) provides countries with simplified methods to carry out fish stock assessment in data-limited contexts, to some extent overcoming the technical barriers that traditional methods presented. This is because country-level reporting will be limited to the assessment of stocks that are found only within a country&amp;#x2019;s EEZ and/or shared with neighbouring countries&amp;#x2019; EEZs, and therefore not include straddling stocks, highly migratory species, or stocks in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ). As a result, national data alone cannot be meaningfully aggregated at global/regional levels, but it can be used to inform country progress on fish stock sustainability within the EEZ. The FAO has developed an online platform to facilitate the estimation and a country&amp;#x2019;s own report of the indicator. The platform provides an E-learning course that help countries to understand the indicator, estimation methodology and report process as well as some simple stock assessment methods that can be used to estimate stock status when only limited data are available to help address the capacity insufficiency faced by many developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the FAO began sending a questionnaire to countries to collect national data with the aim to help countries in the reporting process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indicator measures the sustainability of fishery resources, and as an end-result is a measure of Target 14.4. Its derivation requires catch data and fishing effort and other biological or technical parameters as well together with technical expertise necessary to perform stock assessment. The indicator at global level is estimated by the FAO based on the methodology developed in the 1980s. Although regular updates were carried out to incorporate technical advances and changes in major fish species, some discrepancies between regions may occur in the representativeness of the reference list in practical fisheries. However, this will not pose a large impact on the reliability of the indicator&amp;#x2019;s temporal trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the national level, the composition of stocks within the reference list of stocks and the selection criteria used to develop the list will vary between countries, making the indicator suitable for checking countries&amp;#x2019; own progress over time. However, this reduces the comparability of sustainability levels between countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FAO currently reports the global and regional indicators calculated from FAO&amp;#x2019;s assessment of a selected list of fish stocks around the world. The methodology is described in the FAO Technical Paper (FAO 2011). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; FAO has been developing the new approach for country-level reporting since 2017, and has consulted with countries in three dedicated expert consultation workshops: In November 2017, FAO convened a workshop to exchange views with national practitioners on the new proposed analytical methods to produce Indicator 14.4.1 at country level&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-2&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In February 2019, FAO convened an expert consultation workshop&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-3&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-3&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on development of the methodologies for the global assessment of fish stock status, with participants from countries and regional fisheries organizations. In October 2019, FAO organized a capacity development workshop on stock status assessment and estimation methods of SDG Indicator 14.4.1 for the Asia Pacific Region, with participants from 17 countries. However, so far very few countries have started their own estimation and reporting of Indicator 14.4.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global/Regional:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global and regional estimates of stock sustainability have been performed for 584 fish stocks around the world since 1974, representing 70% of global landings. Each stock is estimated using the methodology described in the FAO Technical Paper (FAO, 2011). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is calculated as the number of stocks with sustainable status divided by the number of stocks with known status in the reference list. This proportion is calculated based on stock numbers, without weighting either by its production volume or stock abundance; that is, every fish stock is considered to have the same importance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries are requested to report the status of a reference list of fish stocks, which should be determined based on the significance of a specific stock in a society, either in landings, economic contribution to society, or cultural and traditional values, rather than based on whether stock assessment exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-2&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; Full report accessible here: http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/I8714EN/ &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-3&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; Full report accessible here: http://www.fao.org/3/ca4355en/ca4355en.pdf &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-3&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;FAO carries out a series of validations to assure that the data and information are provided by countries in line with the questionnaire instructions. The validation process consists of: (i) identification of errors, mistakes and missing value in the data and, (ii) correcting errors, mistakes and missing values in close consultation with the countries concerned. Each country is asked either to confirm that the data provided are correct or to provide remarks and / or revise data accordingly if they identify any errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No adjustments were applied for the time series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#x25CF; At regional and global levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure completeness of regional and global information on stocks, FAO gathers additional information outside of what is provided by each country, in particular concerning the highly migratory and straddling fishing stocks. For shared stocks, FAO may consult with Regional Fisheries Bodies (RFBs), who are mandated to assess and manage stocks with their contracting parties, in order to receive information and data and conduct stock assessment when necessary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#x25CF; At country level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator examines marine fish stocks. If a country has no marine capture fisheries, then the indicator is not calculated for that country. In such case, no imputation is performed to derive estimates. For countries reporting limited marine fish stock data, additional data are compiled from scientific working groups and are peer reviewed and analyzed based on FAO expert knowledge. However, the estimation of the indicator at regional and global levels was estimated not based on country questionnaires, but by the FAO through a systematic assessment of a reference list selected globally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As explained in the &amp;#x201C;Rationale&amp;#x201D; section, national data alone cannot be meaningfully aggregated at global/regional level because country-level reporting will be limited to the assessment of stocks that are found only within a country&amp;#x2019;s EEZ (including stocks shared with neighbouring countries&amp;#x2019; EEZs), and therefore not include straddling stocks, highly migratory species, or stocks in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ). Therefore, regional &amp;#x201C;aggregates&amp;#x201D; by FAO Major Fishing Area and the global indicator value are calculated with a specific approach, as described in the FAO Technical Paper (FAO 2011)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each country, the data available for each stock and expertise level to conduct different types of assessments will differ. Some countries may have classic stock assessments already conducted for many of their stocks, while others may have very few or no assessments available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some countries, little stock assessment has been done. To help these countries and to facilitate their reporting, FAO prepared online materials and tools, including a selection of methods that can be used to evaluate stock status with data limited methods such as length-based and catch-only methods. The strengths and limitations of these methods are discussed in an eLearning course (Lesson 4), and caveats were also provided to avoid misuse and exercise cautions in practice. Furthermore, capacity building workshops have been organised to provide support to countries in stock assessment and reporting on the SDG 14.4.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;eLearning course: &lt;a href=&quot;https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=502&quot;&gt;https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=502&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FAO has in place the necessary frameworks and procedures for quality assurance of the SDG indicators data, according to the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics and the FAO Statistics Quality Assurance Framework (SQAF) available at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3664e/i3664e.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3664e/i3664e.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAO is systematically carrying out quality assessments to ensure the quality of the SDG indicator data sets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this indicator, a systematic cross-checking of the various source data was carried out during the overall compilation process of national and regional data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FAO carries out a quality assurance review to help with consistency and correctness of this reporting process. The review is performed in two steps to quantify the level of confidence that can be attributed to national reporting: 1) to verify that the questionnaire has been correctly and sufficiently filled out and complies with the reporting guidelines, and 2) to assess the reliability of the responses relative to the supporting information reported by the country. Reliability is based on the compliance to the guidelines in developing the reference list of stocks, the proportion of stocks with official assessments, the source of stock assessments (e.g. RFB, peer-reviewed, expert knowledge), the amount of data available at the stock level, and the consistency with regional assessments (for shared stocks). FAO provides feedback to respondents, who have an opportunity to adjust their submission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quality assessment reveals that quality is highly dependent on the primary data which undergoes the applicable validation procedures before dissemination. The outcomes of the calculations are also controlled and compared inside and among FAO fishing areas. Global and regional aggregates are assessed by considering and evaluating the contributions of regional fisheries bodies while ensuring consistency of the entire time series for the global indicator, with reference to the published methodology (FAO, 2011). In addition, an internal summary report on the annual assessment of the quality of country data is also produced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator has global data from 1974 to 2017. Regional breakdown is by FAO major fishing area. The regional and global indicators were calculated based on the reference list of fish stocks FAO established in 1974.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global/regional: the indicator has global and regional data from 1974 to 2017. Regional breakdown is by FAO major fishing area. Countries are not directly involved in the computation of the indicator at global/regional level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National: the national-level questionnaire was dispatched for the first time in November 2019; FAO identifies 165 countries with a marine border, and three countries with Caspian Sea border, as being eligible, in principle, to report. As the result of the first questionnaire call, ninety-seven countries expressed interest in the indicator (59%), of which eighty two replied with completed questionnaires while three countries reported the indicator separately (51.5%), 11 countries stated that they could not report due to lack of data or time, and one responded with some catch data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1974 to 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global/regional level: from 1974 to 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National level: Not available yet (first questionnaire dispatched in November 2019, considered a trial/testing phase).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taxonomically, FAO publishes the indicator separately for straddling stocks (mostly tuna and tuna like).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-4&quot;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.fao.org/cwp-on-fishery-statistics/handbook/general-concepts/fishing-areas-for-statistical-purposes/en/ &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-4&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is estimated by the FAO based on the methodology developed in the 1980s (FAO, 2011). Although regular updates were carried out to incorporate technical advances and changes in major fish species, some discrepancies between regions may occur in the representativeness of the reference list in practical fisheries. However, this will not pose a large impact on the reliability of the Global indicator&amp;#x2019;s temporal trends which covers 75% of global landings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appendix 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guidelines to establish reference list of stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference list compiles a list of fish stocks based on data from the considered area, i.e. a country&amp;#x2019;s EEZ and/or territorial waters and/or possibly the competence area of a regional fisheries management organization. This list of fish stocks will ideally include existing Assessment units or Management units, and also possibly other unassessed fish stocks that are fished in a given country. The list will exclude stocks straddling in the high seas, mostly tuna and tuna-like species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list should:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Represent at least 60% (a higher percent is preferred when possible) of the national total landed and/or reported catch (Total in Tonnes excluding landings from straddling stocks). Information should be provided on all of the stocks that contribute to this top 60% (or more) of landings regardless of whether their status is known. Stocks should be input from left to right on the spreadsheet in the order of the largest to smallest total landings for each stock, by Tonnes. Species with multiple different stocks should be input as separate stocks. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contain stocks of major importance in terms of catch, ecosystem role, economic value, and social/cultural considerations. If possible, the list should represent stocks of each of these categories for a given country. For example, care should be taken to include fish stocks that are important to small-scale fisheries as well as large-scale industrial fisheries. Consideration for these different categories will vary between countries.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remain unchanged (i.e. for at least 5 years) to better reflect changes in stock status at the national level and minimize the effect of changing the reference list of stocks (i.e., adding, deleting, merging stocks) into the SDG indicator. This will ensure consistency in the indicator calculation and better reflect fish stock sustainability over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
