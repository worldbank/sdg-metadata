	<data>&lt;p&gt;The classification of the status of exploited stocks relatively to the abundance that can produce MSY is often established through a formal stock assessment process. The data to inform stock assessments can come from many different sources, including fishery-dependent and fishery-independent sources. Fishery-dependent data are collected from the fishery itself, using both commercial and recreational sources through reporting or sample-based surveys at sea, at landing sites, or within fishing communities. They can include information on removals of fish from the sea, which can include landings and discards, and information on the fleet such as number of boats, number of tows, time spent on the sea, as well as economic and social information like fish prices, fuel expenditures, total sales, employment or other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fishery-independent data are obtained in ways not related to any fishing activity and are typically collected by scientists via surveys (often scientific cruises) designed to estimate species abundance and biomass over long time series, and over consistent seasons and geographic areas. Typically, fisheries-independent data also include biological information on the species (age, length, weight, maturity, etc.), and habitat and environmental information (temperature, salinity, depth, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data and other information are used by Stock Assessment scientists to classify the stock status. References on the methods most commonly used can be found in Cadima (2003), Haddon (2011), Sparre and Venema (1998) and other publications dealing with the methods of stock assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information used for the indicator at the Global/Regional level is based on a different process and data sources than that used for the national level &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global/Regional:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the high data demands of classical stock assessment methods, only a limited number of fish stocks have been assessed. These species account for ca 50 percent of the global catch (Hilborn et al., 2020), and most are caught by industrial fisheries in developed countries . To balance the global representativeness of the assessment results and the goal of using the best available information, the FAO uses a wide spectrum of data and methods to extend its assessment to the fish stocks that account for the majority (70-80 percent) of the global catch (FAO, 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The national level indicator, on the other hand, is based exclusively on the stock status reported by countries. A multiplicity of methods are used to classify the stock status, including model-based estimates, empirical indicators and documented expert opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For country reporting, a questionnaire was sent out to all FAO member States with marine boundaries (i.e. 165 States) in 2019, and will be resent in 2021, and then on a two-year basis. For the complete list of questions used to inform this indicator, please refer to Appendix 2.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
