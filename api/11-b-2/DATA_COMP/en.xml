	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 11-b-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Member States count the number of local governments that adopt and implement local DRR strategies in line with the national strategy and express it as a percentage of the total number of local governments in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local governments are determined by the reporting country for this indicator, considering sub-national public administrations with responsibility to develop local disaster risk reduction strategies. It is recommended that countries report on progress made by the lowest level of government accorded the mandate for disaster risk reduction, as the Sendai Framework promotes the adoption and implementation of local disaster risk reduction strategies in every local authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Member State will calculate the ratio of the number of local governments with local DRR strategies in line with national strategies and the total number of local governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Average will then be calculated as below through arithmetic average of the data from each Member State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Further information of the methodology can be obtained in the Technical Guidance (see reference).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
