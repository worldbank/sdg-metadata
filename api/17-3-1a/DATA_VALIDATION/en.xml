	<message>The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 17-3-1a, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Extensive validation and quality assurance procedures are in place and being further developed at OECD and UNCTAD. Flows where the recipient country, after discussion with the custodian agency and/or the reporting provider country, objects to their characterization as supporting its sustainable development may be excluded. The custodian agencies are requested to establish mechanisms for validation based on the sustainable development criteria applied for this indicator which will adequately support concerns of the recipient countries.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
