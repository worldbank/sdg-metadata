&lt;p&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Concepts and definitions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definition:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amount of water- and sanitation-related official development assistance that is part of a government-coordinated spending plan is defined as the proportion of total water and sanitation-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) disbursements that are included in the government budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;International cooperation and capacity-building support&amp;#x201D; implies aid (most of it quantifiable) in the form of grants or loans by external support agencies. The amount of water and sanitation-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) can be used as a proxy for this, captured by OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS). ODA is defined as flows of official financing administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as the main objective, and which are concessional in character with a grant element of at least 25 per cent (using a fixed 10 per cent rate of discount). By convention, ODA flows comprise contributions of donor government agencies, at all levels, to developing countries (&amp;#x201C;bilateral ODA&amp;#x201D;) and to multilateral institutions. ODA receipts, from a recipient perspective, comprise disbursements by bilateral donors and multilateral institutions. Lending by export credit agencies&amp;#x2014;with the pure purpose of export promotion&amp;#x2014;is excluded (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;Developing countries&amp;#x201D; refer to countries, which are eligible to receive official development assistance (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/daclist.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/daclist.htm&lt;/a&gt;). This limits the scope of reporting to those countries receiving water and sanitation ODA, and the number of such countries is expected to decrease going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water and sanitation-related activities and programmes include those for water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) (targets 6.1, 6.2), wastewater and water quality (6.3), water efficiency (6.4), water resource management (6.5), and water-related ecosystems (6.6). As per target 6.a wording, it includes activities and programmes for water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A government coordinated spending plan is defined as a financing plan/budget for the water and sanitation sector, clearly assessing the available sources of finance and strategies for financing future needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Data sources&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) provides information on governance, monitoring, human resources, and financing in the water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sector. The UN-Water GLAAS survey is currently conducted on a biennial basis, led by WHO, and collected data from 94 countries (predominantly low and lower-middle income countries) in the most recent cycle in 2013-2014. The scope of the question on external funding has been expanded beyond WASH for the 2016-17 GLAAS cycle to include wastewater and water quality, water efficiency, water resource management, and the status of water-related ecosystems. GLAAS has completed three full cycles (2009-2010, 2011-2012, and 2013-2014), as well as a pilot conducted in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National governments participating in the GLAAS survey fill out the questionnaire, preferably supported by a multi-stakeholder review. Although one ministry leads the process, it is often the case that many different ministries and departments must be involved in the process in order to obtain the data required to complete the questionnaire. A GLAAS national focal person supports the lead ministry to coordinate data collection, to compile the national response to the questionnaire, and to lead on the process of data validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) has been collecting data on aid flows since 1973 through the OECD Creditor Reporting System based on a standard methodology and agreed definitions from member countries and other aid providers. The data are generally obtained on an activity level, and include numerous parameters to allow disaggregation by provider and recipient country, by type of finance, and by type of resources provided. Data are available for essentially all high-income countries as bilateral donors, and for an increasing number of middle-income aid providers, as well as multi-lateral lending institutions. Methodology on ODA data collection by OECD can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data will be complemented by Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) reporting in SDG target 6.5 (for wastewater and water quality, water efficiency, water resource management, and the status of water-related ecosystems) (UNEP 2016). The analysis of IWRM has been done in the past by UN-Water in 2008 (led by UN-DESA) and in 2012 (led by UNEP, UNDP, GWP and SIWI) as requested by the UN Commission for Sustainable Development (UN-Water 2008, 2012).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Collection process:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National governments participating in the UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) survey fill out the questionnaire, preferably supported by a multi-stakeholder review. Although one ministry leads the process (e.g. Ministry of Water, Ministry of Environment, etc. depending on country), it is often the case that many different ministries and departments must be involved in the process in order to obtain the data required to complete the questionnaire. A GLAAS national focal person supports the lead ministry to coordinate data collection, to compile the national response to the questionnaire, and to lead on the process of data validation. For each GLAAS submission, information on the country processes is collected (number of ministries involved, whether a national meeting was held to support the filling of the questionnaire, stakeholder validation, use of documentation, etc.). Once received, the country submission undergoes a thorough data validation process, which is often an iterative process requiring communication and feedback with regional and country counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries are also requested to provide consent to publish individual, validated data responses as supplied to GLAAS. Thus through the data collection, validation and consultation processes, the results are expected to be comparable and no further adjustments are foreseen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Calendar&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data collection:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current round of GLAAS has been launched and data for 2015 ODA disbursements channelled through national government budgets will be available by end-2016. OECD data on ODA disbursements for 2015 will be made available through CRS in December 2016. (From NA to NA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Data release:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHO and OECD, with support from UNEP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rationale:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of water and sanitation-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) is a quantifiable measurement as a proxy for &amp;#x201C;international cooperation and capacity development support&amp;#x201D; in financial terms. It is essential to be able to assess ODA in proportion with how much of it is included in the government budget to gain a better understanding of whether donors are aligned with national governments while highlighting total water and sanitation ODA disbursements to developing countries over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A low value of this indicator (near 0%) would suggest that international donors are investing in water and sanitation related activities and programmes in the country outside the purview of the national government. A high value (near 100%) would indicate that donors are aligned with national government and national policies and plans for water and sanitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Comments and limitations:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on water and sanitation-related ODA included in the government budget will be available by end-2016 with the current cycle of UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) data. Until then, total water and sanitation-related ODA (denominator) will be reported. Total water and sanitation-related ODA will continue to be reported as an additional indicator going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the proportion of ODA channelled through the government treasury will be reported as an additional indicator. ODA channelled through treasury indicates a high level of cooperation and alignment between donors and national government in which the donors channel funds through the national budget process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS) currently disaggregates ODA for the water and sanitation among several categories including: sector policy and administration, water resources protection, large and basic water and sanitation systems, river basin infrastructure, waste management, agricultural water resources, and education and training. While these categories do not align directly with the target areas of SDG 6 individually, which limits the disaggregation of ODA among the SDG target areas, the combined ODA from these categories does align with a majority of the reported ODA to the water sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the numerator and denominator come from different sources, there is the possibility of different underlying assumptions regarding what should be included/excluded in the ODA figures. This could lead to situations in which the proportion of ODA included in government budget is greater than 1 (100%) if total ODA reported to OECD is lower than ODA reported to be included the budget. To guard against this possibility, the OECD will supply GLAAS with the reported ODA figures, broken down to the project level, so that respondents can match these with their on-budget project data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ODA represents only one aspect of international cooperation. To capture other dimensions, additional supporting indicators are available, including indicators for the Collaborative Behaviours identified by the Sanitation and Water for All (SWA) partnership. Each behaviour has one or two key indicators for governments and for development partners. If the behaviours are jointly adapted by governments and development partners, long-term sector performance and sustainability would improve. For additional information on the Collaborative Behaviours see: &lt;a href=&quot;http://sanitationandwaterforall.org/about/the-four-swa-collaborative-behaviours/&quot;&gt;http://sanitationandwaterforall.org/about/the-four-swa-collaborative-behaviours/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Methodology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Computation method:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is computed as the proportion of total water and sanitation-related ODA that is included in the government budget, i.e. the amount of water and sanitation-related ODA in the government budget divided by the total amount of water and sanitation-related ODA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numerator on water and sanitation-related ODA in the government budget will be obtained from the UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) survey for the 2016-2017 cycle. The question on external funding collects data on the amount of donor funds that were included in government budget. Data for 2015 ODA disbursements through GLAAS will be available by end-2016. The scope of the question on external funding has been expanded beyond WASH for the 2016-17 cycle to address all targets under SDG 6, including wastewater and water quality, water efficiency, water resource management, and water-related ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The denominator on total water and sanitation-related ODA disbursements will be obtained through OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS) (purpose codes 14000-series for the water sector and purpose code 31140 for agricultural water resources). Data on ODA disbursements for 2015 will be made available through CRS in December 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Treatment of missing values:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;At country level:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the highly country- and context-specific nature of ODA disbursements and whether they are aligned with national government plans, no estimates are produced for countries that are missing data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;At regional and global levels:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If no data is provided for the amount of ODA included in the budget, then the country is excluded from the regional and/or global analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Regional aggregates:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global and regional aggregates for ODA are derived based on summation of recipient country ODA disbursement for the water sector (purpose codes 14000- series) and agricultural water resources (purpose code 31140) from the OECD Creditor Reporting System. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global and regional proportions of ODA disbursements as part of a government budget are derived for countries based on a summation of ODA for the water sector that is included in the budget divided by a summation of total ODA for water sector. The calculation of global and regional aggregates would only be performed for those countries reporting the amount of ODA for the water sector that is included in the budget. If no data is provided for the amount of ODA in the budget, then the country is excluded from the regional and/or global analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questionnaires for providers of development cooperation are available at the following link: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/&quot;&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/&lt;/a&gt; The data included in the indicator are ODA flows from all donors to developing countries eligible for ODA for the water sector (water and sanitation (purpose codes 14000- series), agricultural water resources (purpose code 31140), flood prevention/control (purpose code 41050), and hydroelectric power plants (purpose code 23220)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) has been collecting data on aid flows since 1973 through the OECD Creditor Reporting System based on a standard methodology and agreed definitions from member countries and other aid providers. The data are generally obtained on an activity level, and include numerous parameters to allow disaggregation by provider and recipient country, by type of finance, and by type of resources provided. Data are available for essentially all high-income countries as bilateral donors, and for an increasing number of middle-income aid providers, as well as multi-lateral lending institutions.

&lt;p&gt;Data are collected using a converged reporting system whereby bilateral and multilateral providers of development co-operation use a single file format (Creditor Reporting System &amp;#x2013; CRS) to report at item level on all flows of resources to developing countries. Item-level reporting is validated against key aggregates also reported by donors and then serves as the basis for producing various other aggregate statistics. For further details, see: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A statistical reporter is responsible for the collection of DAC statistics in each providing country/agency. This reporter is usually located in the national aid agency, Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Finance etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Data availability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asia and Pacific:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Most countries (at least 80% of the countries covering 90% of the population from the region)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Africa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Most countries (at least 80% of the countries covering 90% of the population from the region)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Latin America and the Caribbean&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Most countries (at least 80% of the countries covering 90% of the population from the region)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Some countries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that these reflect availability of data on total water and sanitation ODA. Data on proportion included in government budget will be available through the current cycle of GLAAS (cf. 7.1, 10.1, and 10.2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time series:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time series of parameters under the indicator are available for 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsector disaggregation (basic vs. large systems)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be differences in how much development aid is reported by a recipient country and the amount of ODA disbursed to that country as reported by the OECD-CRS. While OECD captures a significant amount of the aid flows (as reported by external donors) to the water and sanitation sector, countries may receive development aid for water and sanitation from national and international donors that do not report to the OECD-CRS data system. Other differences may occur if recipient countries define development aid more or less rigorously than OECD&amp;#x2019;s definition of ODA, or use different timeframes (e.g. fiscal year instead of calendar year) to report aid flows. In order to ensure data is as consistent as possible, the OECD will supply the reported ODA figures broken down to the project level, so that respondents can match these with their on-budget project data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;References&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Définition : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le montant de l&apos;aide publique au développement liée à l&apos;eau et à l&apos;assainissement qui fait partie d&apos;un plan de dépenses coordonné par le gouvernement est défini comme la proportion des décaissements totaux de l&apos;aide publique au développement (APD) liée à l&apos;eau et à l&apos;assainissement qui sont inclus dans le budget du gouvernement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C; Le soutien à la coopération internationale et au renforcement des capacités&amp;#x201D; implique une aide (pour la plupart quantifiable) sous forme de dons ou de prêts par des organismes de soutien extérieurs. Le montant de l&apos;aide publique au développement (APD) liée à l&apos;eau et à l&apos;assainissement peut être utilisé comme une approximation de cette aide, saisie par le Système de notification des pays créanciers (SNPC) de l&apos;OCDE. L&apos;APD est définie comme des flux de financement officiel administrés avec pour principal objectif la promotion du développement économique et du bien-être des pays en développement, et qui sont de nature concessionnelle avec un élément de subvention d&apos;au moins 25 % (en utilisant un taux d&apos;actualisation fixe de 10 %). Par convention, les flux d&apos;APD comprennent les contributions des organismes gouvernementaux donateurs, à tous les niveaux, aux pays en développement (&amp;#x201C; APD bilatérale &amp;#x201D;) et aux institutions multilatérales. Les recettes d&apos;APD, du point de vue du bénéficiaire, comprennent les décaissements des donateurs bilatéraux et des institutions multilatérales. Les prêts des organismes de crédit à l&apos;exportation &amp;#x2014; ayant pour seul but la promotion des exportations &amp;#x2014; sont exclus (voir &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;Les pays en développement &amp;#x201D; désignent les pays qui peuvent bénéficier de l&apos;aide publique au développement (voir &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/daclist.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/daclist.htm&lt;/a&gt;). Cela limite la portée des rapports aux pays recevant une APD pour l&apos;eau et l&apos;assainissement, et le nombre de ces pays devrait diminuer à l&apos;avenir. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les activités et programmes liés à l&apos;eau et à l&apos;assainissement comprennent ceux qui concernent l&apos;approvisionnement en eau, l&apos;assainissement et l&apos;hygiène (WASH) (cibles 6.1, 6.2), les eaux usées et la qualité de l&apos;eau (6.3), l&apos;utilisation rationnelle de l&apos;eau (6.4), la gestion des ressources en eau (6.5) et les écosystèmes liés à l&apos;eau (6.6). Selon la formulation de l&apos;objectif 6.a, il comprend des activités et des programmes pour la collecte de l&apos;eau, le dessalement, l&apos;utilisation efficace de l&apos;eau, le traitement des eaux usées, le recyclage et les technologies de réutilisation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Un plan de dépenses coordonné du gouvernement est défini comme un plan/budget de financement pour le secteur de l&apos;eau et de l&apos;assainissement, évaluant clairement les sources de financement disponibles et les stratégies de financement des besoins futurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Sources de données&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L&apos;analyse et l&apos;évaluation mondiales de l&apos;assainissement et de l&apos;eau potable (GLAAS) d&apos;ONU-Eau fournit des informations sur la gouvernance, le suivi, les ressources humaines et le financement dans le secteur de l&apos;eau, de l&apos;assainissement et de l&apos;hygiène (WASH). L&apos;enquête GLAAS d&apos;ONU-Eau est actuellement menée sur une base biennale, sous la direction de l&apos;OMS, et a recueilli des données dans 94 pays (principalement des pays à revenu faible et moyen inférieur) au cours du cycle le plus récent, en 2013-2014. La portée de la question sur le financement externe a été élargie au-delà de l&apos;enquête WASH pour le cycle GLAAS 2016-17 afin d&apos;inclure les eaux usées et la qualité de l&apos;eau, l&apos;efficacité de l&apos;eau, la gestion des ressources en eau et l&apos;état des écosystèmes liés à l&apos;eau. GLAAS a achevé trois cycles complets (2009-2010, 2011-2012 et 2013-2014), ainsi qu&apos;un projet pilote mené en 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les gouvernements nationaux participant à l&apos;enquête GLAAS remplissent le questionnaire, de préférence en s&apos;appuyant sur un examen multipartite. Bien qu&apos;un ministère dirige le processus, il arrive souvent que plusieurs ministères et départements différents doivent être impliqués dans le processus afin d&apos;obtenir les données requises pour remplir le questionnaire. Un responsable national du GLAAS aide le ministère responsable à coordonner la collecte des données, à compiler la réponse nationale au questionnaire et à diriger le processus de validation des données. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le Comité d&apos;aide au développement (CAD) de l&apos;OCDE collecte des données sur les flux d&apos;aide depuis 1973 par le biais du Système de notification des pays créanciers de l&apos;OCDE, sur la base d&apos;une méthodologie standard et de définitions convenues avec les pays membres et d&apos;autres fournisseurs d&apos;aide. Les données sont généralement obtenues au niveau des activités et comprennent de nombreux paramètres permettant une ventilation par pays fournisseur et bénéficiaire, par type de financement et par type de ressources fournies. Les données sont disponibles pour pratiquement tous les pays à revenu élevé en tant que donateurs bilatéraux, et pour un nombre croissant de fournisseurs d&apos;aide à revenu moyen, ainsi que pour les institutions de prêt multilatérales. La méthodologie de collecte de données sur l&apos;APD par l&apos;OCDE peut être consultée ici : &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les données seront complétées par des rapports sur la gestion intégrée des ressources en eau (GIRE) dans le cadre de l&apos;objectif 6.5 du SDG (pour les eaux usées et la qualité de l&apos;eau, l&apos;efficacité de l&apos;eau, la gestion des ressources en eau et l&apos;état des écosystèmes liés à l&apos;eau) (PNUE 2016). L&apos;analyse de la GIRE a été effectuée dans le passé par l&apos;ONU-Eau en 2008 (sous la direction du DAES) et en 2012 (sous la direction du PNUE, du PNUD, du GWP et du SIWI) à la demande de la Commission des Nations unies pour le développement durable (ONU-Eau 2008, 2012). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Processus de collecte : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les gouvernements nationaux participant à l&apos;enquête GLAAS (Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking Water) de l&apos;ONU-Eau remplissent le questionnaire, de préférence en s&apos;appuyant sur un examen multipartite. Bien qu&apos;un ministère dirige le processus (par exemple, le ministère de l&apos;eau, le ministère de l&apos;environnement, etc. selon le pays), il arrive souvent que de nombreux ministères et départements différents doivent être impliqués dans le processus afin d&apos;obtenir les données requises pour remplir le questionnaire. Un point focal national du GLAAS aide le ministère responsable à coordonner la collecte des données, à compiler la réponse nationale au questionnaire et à diriger le processus de validation des données. Pour chaque soumission GLAAS, des informations sur les processus nationaux sont collectées (nombre de ministères impliqués, si une réunion nationale a eu lieu pour soutenir le remplissage du questionnaire, validation des parties prenantes, utilisation de la documentation, etc.). Une fois reçue, la soumission du pays est soumise à un processus de validation des données approfondi, qui est souvent un processus itératif nécessitant une communication et un retour d&apos;information avec les homologues régionaux et nationaux. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les pays sont également invités à donner leur accord pour la publication des réponses individuelles et validées fournies au GLAAS. Ainsi, grâce aux processus de collecte, de validation et de consultation des données, les résultats devraient être comparables et aucun autre ajustement n&apos;est prévu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Calendrier&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Collecte de données :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le cycle actuel de GLAAS a été lancé et les données relatives aux déboursements d&apos;APD en 2015, acheminés par les budgets des gouvernements nationaux, seront disponibles d&apos;ici la fin de l&apos;année 2016. Les données de l&apos;OCDE sur les versements d&apos;APD pour 2015 seront disponibles par l&apos;intermédiaire des SNPC en décembre 2016. (De NA à NA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Publication des données :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q1 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Fournisseurs de données&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministères ayant des responsabilités liées aux finances, à l&apos;approvisionnement en eau et à l&apos;assainissement, à l&apos;agriculture, au développement et à la gestion des ressources en eau, à l&apos;environnement et aux affaires étrangères&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Compilateurs de données &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nom : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OMS et OCDE, PNUE &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OMS et OCDE, avec le soutien du PNUE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Raison d&apos;être :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le montant de l&apos;aide publique au développement (APD) liée à l&apos;eau et à l&apos;assainissement est une mesure quantifiable qui représente, en termes financiers, le soutien à la coopération internationale et au développement des capacités&amp;#x201C;. Il est essentiel de pouvoir évaluer l&apos;APD proportionnellement à la part qu&apos;elle représente dans le budget du gouvernement afin de mieux comprendre si les donateurs s&apos;alignent sur les gouvernements nationaux tout en mettant en évidence le total des versements d&apos;APD pour l&apos;eau et l&apos;assainissement aux pays en développement au fil du temps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Une valeur faible de cet indicateur (près de 0 %) suggérerait que les donateurs internationaux investissent dans des activités et des programmes liés à l&apos;eau et à l&apos;assainissement dans le pays qui ne relèvent pas du gouvernement national. Une valeur élevée (près de 100 %) indiquerait que les donateurs s&apos;alignent sur les politiques et les plans du gouvernement national et du pays en matière d&apos;eau et d&apos;assainissement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Commentaires et limitations : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les données sur l&apos;APD liée à l&apos;eau et à l&apos;assainissement incluses dans le budget du gouvernement seront disponibles d&apos;ici la fin de l&apos;année 2016 avec le cycle actuel des données de l&apos;analyse et de l&apos;évaluation mondiales de l&apos;assainissement et de l&apos;eau potable (GLAAS) d&apos;ONU-Eau. D&apos;ici là, le total de l&apos;APD liée à l&apos;eau et à l&apos;assainissement (dénominateur) sera communiqué. L&apos;APD totale liée à l&apos;eau et à l&apos;assainissement continuera d&apos;être rapportée en tant qu&apos;indicateur supplémentaire à l&apos;avenir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En outre, la proportion de l&apos;APD acheminée par le Trésor public sera indiquée comme un indicateur supplémentaire&lt;p&gt;. L&apos;APD acheminée par le Trésor public indique un niveau élevé de coopération et d&apos;alignement entre les donateurs et le gouvernement national, les donateurs acheminant les fonds par le biais du processus budgétaire national. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le système de notification des pays créanciers de l&apos;OCDE (SNPC) ventile actuellement l&apos;APD pour l&apos;eau et l&apos;assainissement en plusieurs catégories, notamment : la politique et l&apos;administration sectorielles, la protection des ressources en eau, les systèmes d&apos;eau et d&apos;assainissement de base et de grande envergure, l&apos;infrastructure des bassins fluviaux, la gestion des déchets, les ressources en eau agricole, et l&apos;éducation et la formation. Bien que ces catégories ne s&apos;alignent pas directement sur les domaines cibles du SDG 6 pris individuellement, ce qui limite la ventilation de l&apos;APD entre les domaines cibles du SDG, l&apos;APD combinée de ces catégories s&apos;aligne sur la majorité de l&apos;APD déclarée au secteur de l&apos;eau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comme le numérateur et le dénominateur proviennent de sources différentes, il est possible que les hypothèses sous-jacentes concernant les éléments à inclure/exclure dans les chiffres de l&apos;APD soient différentes. Cela pourrait conduire à des situations dans lesquelles la proportion de l&apos;APD incluse dans le budget du gouvernement est supérieure à 1 (100%) si l&apos;APD totale déclarée à l&apos;OCDE est inférieure à l&apos;APD déclarée pour être incluse dans le budget. Pour éviter cette éventualité, l&apos;OCDE fournira à GLAAS les chiffres de l&apos;APD déclarés, ventilés au niveau des projets, afin que les répondants puissent les faire correspondre aux données de leurs projets inscrits au budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; L&apos;APD ne représente qu&apos;un aspect de la coopération internationale. Pour saisir d&apos;autres dimensions, des indicateurs de soutien supplémentaires sont disponibles, y compris des indicateurs pour les comportements de collaboration identifiés par le partenariat Assainissement et eau pour tous (SWA). Chaque comportement comporte un ou deux indicateurs clés pour les gouvernements et les partenaires du développement. Si les comportements sont adaptés conjointement par les gouvernements et les partenaires de développement, la performance et la durabilité à long terme du secteur s&apos;en trouveront améliorées. Pour plus d&apos;informations sur les comportements de collaboration, voir &lt;a href=&quot;http://sanitationandwaterforall.org/about/the-four-swa-collaborative-behaviours/&quot;&gt;http://sanitationandwaterforall.org/about/the-four-swa-collaborative-behaviours/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Méthodologie&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Méthode de calcul :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L&apos;indicateur est calculé comme la proportion de l&apos;APD totale liée à l&apos;eau et à l&apos;assainissement qui est incluse dans le budget du gouvernement, c&apos;est-à-dire le montant de l&apos;APD liée à l&apos;eau et à l&apos;assainissement dans le budget du gouvernement divisé par le montant total de l&apos;APD liée à l&apos;eau et à l&apos;assainissement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le numérateur de l&apos;APD liée à l&apos;eau et à l&apos;assainissement dans le budget du gouvernement sera obtenu à partir de l&apos;enquête GLAAS (Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water) de l&apos;ONU-Eau pour le cycle 2016-2017. La question sur le financement externe permet de recueillir des données sur le montant des fonds des donateurs qui ont été inclus dans le budget du gouvernement. Les données relatives aux décaissements de l&apos;APD en 2015 par le biais de GLAAS seront disponibles d&apos;ici la fin de l&apos;année 2016. La portée de la question sur le financement externe a été élargie au-delà de l&apos;enquête WASH pour le cycle 2016-17 afin de couvrir tous les objectifs du ODD 6, y compris les eaux usées et la qualité de l&apos;eau, l&apos;efficacité de l&apos;eau, la gestion des ressources en eau et les écosystèmes liés à l&apos;eau. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le dénominateur du total des versements d&apos;APD liés à l&apos;eau et à l&apos;assainissement sera obtenu par le biais du système de notification des pays créanciers (SNPC) de l&apos;OCDE (codes d&apos;objectif de la série 14000 pour le secteur de l&apos;eau et code d&apos;objectif 31140 pour les ressources en eau agricoles). Les données sur les versements d&apos;APD pour 2015 seront disponibles par le biais du SNPC en décembre 2016. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Traitement des valeurs manquantes : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Au niveau national : &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En raison de la nature très spécifique des décaissements de l&apos;APD en fonction du pays et du contexte et du fait qu&apos;ils soient ou non alignés sur les plans des gouvernements nationaux, aucune estimation n&apos;est produite pour les pays pour lesquels il manque des données.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Au niveau régional et mondial : &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Si aucune donnée n&apos;est fournie pour le montant de l&apos;APD inclus dans le budget, le pays est alors exclu de l&apos;analyse régionale et/ou mondiale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Agrégats régionaux : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les agrégats mondiaux et régionaux de l&apos;APD sont calculés sur la base de la somme des décaissements d&apos;APD des pays bénéficiaires pour le secteur de l&apos;eau (codes d&apos;objectif 14000) et les ressources en eau agricoles (code d&apos;objectif 31140) du système de notification des pays créanciers de l&apos;OCDE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les proportions mondiales et régionales des décaissements d&apos;APD dans le cadre d&apos;un budget gouvernemental sont calculées pour les pays sur la base d&apos;une somme d&apos;APD pour le secteur de l&apos;eau qui est incluse dans le budget, divisée par une somme d&apos;APD totale pour le secteur de l&apos;eau. Le calcul des agrégats mondiaux et régionaux ne serait effectué que pour les pays qui déclarent le montant de l&apos;APD pour le secteur de l&apos;eau qui est inclus dans le budget. Si aucune donnée n&apos;est fournie pour le montant de l&apos;APD dans le budget, le pays est alors exclu de l&apos;analyse régionale et/ou mondiale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Méthodes et orientations mises à la disposition des pays pour la compilation des données au niveau national :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les questionnaires destinés aux fournisseurs de la coopération au développement sont disponibles sur le lien suivant : &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/&quot;&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/&lt;/a&gt; Les données incluses dans l&apos;indicateur sont les flux d&apos;APD de tous les donateurs vers les pays en développement éligibles à l&apos;APD pour le secteur de l&apos;eau (eau et assainissement (codes d&apos;objectif 14000 - série), ressources en eau agricoles (code d&apos;objectif 31140), prévention/contrôle des inondations (code d&apos;objectif 41050), et centrales hydroélectriques (code d&apos;objectif 23220)). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le Comité d&apos;aide au développement (CAD) de l&apos;OCDE collecte des données sur les flux d&apos;aide depuis 1973 par le biais du Système de notification des pays créanciers de l&apos;OCDE, sur la base d&apos;une méthodologie standard et de définitions convenues avec les pays membres et d&apos;autres fournisseurs d&apos;aide. Les données sont généralement obtenues au niveau des activités et comprennent de nombreux paramètres permettant une ventilation par pays fournisseur et bénéficiaire, par type de financement et par type de ressources fournies. Les données sont disponibles pour pratiquement tous les pays à revenu élevé en tant que donateurs bilatéraux, et pour un nombre croissant de fournisseurs d&apos;aide à revenu moyen, ainsi que pour les institutions de prêt multilatérales. La méthodologie de collecte de données sur l&apos;APD par l&apos;OCDE peut être consultée ici : &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Assurance de la qualité : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les données sont collectées au moyen d&apos;un système de notification convergent dans lequel les fournisseurs bilatéraux et multilatéraux de la coopération au développement utilisent un format de fichier unique (Système de notification des créanciers &amp;#x2013; CRS) pour rendre compte au niveau des postes de tous les flux de ressources vers les pays en développement. La déclaration au niveau des postes est validée par rapport aux principaux agrégats également communiqués par les donateurs et sert ensuite de base à la production de diverses autres statistiques agrégées. Pour plus de détails, voir : &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Un déclarant statistique est responsable de la collecte des statistiques du CAD dans chaque pays/organisme fournisseur. Ce déclarant se trouve généralement dans l&apos;organisme d&apos;aide national, le ministère des affaires étrangères ou des finances, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Disponibilité des données &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asie et Pacifique : &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; La plupart des pays (au moins 80% des pays couvrant 90% de la population de la région) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Afrique&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: La plupart des pays (au moins 80% des pays couvrant 90% de la population de la région) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amérique latine et Caraïbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; : La plupart des pays (au moins 80% des pays couvrant 90% de la population de la région) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Europe, Amérique du Nord, Australie, Nouvelle-Zélande et Japon &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; : Certains pays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veuillez noter que ces chiffres reflètent la disponibilité des données sur l&apos;APD totale en matière d&apos;eau et d&apos;assainissement. Les données sur la proportion incluse dans le budget du gouvernement seront disponibles pendant le cycle actuel de GLAAS (cf. 7.1, 10.1, et 10.2). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Séries chronologiques : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Les séries chronologiques des paramètres de l&apos;indicateur sont disponibles pour 2008, 2010, 2012 et 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disagrégation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Désagrégation des sous-secteurs (systèmes de base contre grands systèmes) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources des divergences : &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il peut y avoir des différences entre le montant de l&apos;aide au développement déclaré par un pays bénéficiaire et le montant de l&apos;APD versée à ce pays, tel qu&apos;il est indiqué dans le document de l&apos;OCDE sur les stratégies de réduction de la pauvreté. Alors que l&apos;OCDE saisit un montant significatif des flux d&apos;aide (tels que rapportés par les donateurs externes) au secteur de l&apos;eau et de l&apos;assainissement, les pays peuvent recevoir de l&apos;aide au développement pour l&apos;eau et l&apos;assainissement de la part de donateurs nationaux et internationaux qui ne font pas rapport au système de données de l&apos;OCDE-CRS. D&apos;autres différences peuvent apparaître si les pays bénéficiaires définissent l&apos;aide au développement de manière plus ou moins rigoureuse que la définition de l&apos;APD de l&apos;OCDE &amp;#x2019;, ou s&apos;ils utilisent des calendriers différents (par exemple, l&apos;année fiscale au lieu de l&apos;année civile) pour déclarer les flux d&apos;aide. Afin de garantir la plus grande cohérence possible des données, l&apos;OCDE fournira les chiffres de l&apos;APD déclarés, ventilés au niveau des projets, afin que les répondants puissent les faire correspondre aux données de leurs projets inscrites au budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Références&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;«Поддержка международного сотрудничества и наращивания потенциала» подразумевает помощь (большая часть которой поддается количественной оценке) в форме грантов или займов со стороны агентств, осуществляющих внешнюю поддержку. Объем официальной помощи в целях развития (ОПР), связанной с водоснабжением и санитарией, может использоваться в качестве косвенного показателя, что отражается в Системе отчетности кредиторов (СОК) ОЭСР. ОПР определяется как потоки официального финансирования, администрируемые с целью содействия экономическому развитию и благосостоянию развивающихся стран в качестве основной цели, и которые носят льготный характер и предусматривают грант-элемент в размере не менее 25 процентов (при использовании фиксированной 10-процентной ставки дисконтирования). Традиционно потоки ОПР включают взносы правительственных учреждений-доноров на всех уровнях в развивающиеся страны («двусторонняя ОПР») и в многосторонние учреждения. Поступления ОПР с точки зрения получателя включают выплаты двусторонних доноров и многосторонних учреждений. Предоставление ссуд экспортными кредитными агентствами - исключительно с целью содействия экспорту - исключается (см. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Термин &quot;Развивающиеся страны&quot; относятся к странам, имеющим право на получение официальной помощи в целях развития (см. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/daclist.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/daclist.htm&lt;/a&gt;). Это ограничивает объем отчетности для тех стран, которые получают ОПР в области водоснабжения и санитарии, и ожидается, что число таких стран в будущем будет уменьшаться. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Мероприятия и программы, связанные с водоснабжением и санитарией, включают в себя мероприятия и программы в области водоснабжения, санитарии и гигиены (ВСГ) (задачи 6.1, 6.2), сточных вод и качества воды (6.3), повышения эффективности водопользования (6.4), управления водными ресурсами (6.5). и экосистем, связанных с водой (6.6). Согласно формулировке задачи 6.a, она включает мероприятия и программы по сбору воды, опреснению, повышению эффективности водопользования, очистке сточных вод, применению технологий по переработке и повторному использованию. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; План расходов, координируемый правительством, определяется как план / бюджет финансирования сектора водоснабжения и канализации, в котором четко оцениваются доступные источники финансирования и стратегии финансирования будущих потребностей.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Источники данных &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; Описание: &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Глобальный анализ и оценка состояния санитарии и питьевого водоснабжения в рамках Механизма «ООН – Водные ресурсы» (ГЛAAС) предоставляет информацию об управлении, мониторинге, людских ресурсах и финансировании в секторе водоснабжения, санитарии и гигиены (ВСГ). Обследование ООН-Водные ресурсы для ГЛААС в настоящее время проводится раз в два года под руководством ВОЗ и собрала данные из 94 стран (преимущественно из стран с низким уровнем дохода и уровнем дохода ниже среднего) за последний цикл 2013–2014 годов. Область вопроса о внешнем финансировании была расширена, выйдя за пределы ВСГ для цикла ГЛААС 2016-2017 годов, и теперь этот вопрос включает сточные воды и качество воды, повышение эффективности водопользования, управление водными ресурсами и состояние связанных с водой экосистем. Процесс ГЛААС завершил три полных цикла (2009-2010, 2011-2012 и 2013-2014 годы), а также пилотный проект, проведенный в 2008 году. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Национальные правительства, участвующие в обследовании для ГЛААС, заполняют вопросник, желательно при поддержке широкого круга заинтересованных сторон. Хотя процесс возглавляет одно министерство, часто бывает, что в процесс необходимо вовлекать множество различных министерств и ведомств, чтобы получить данные, необходимые для заполнения вопросника. Национальный координатор ГЛААС оказывает поддержку ведущему министерству в координации сбора данных, в составлении национального ответа на вопросник и в руководстве процессом валидации данных.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Комитет содействия развитию ОЭСР (КСР) собирает данные по потокам помощи с 1973 года от стран-членов и других поставщиков помощи с использованием Системы отчетности кредиторов (СОК) ОЭСР на основе стандартной методологии и согласованных определений. Данные обычно получают на уровне видов деятельности и включают множество параметров, позволяющих дезагрегировать их по поставщикам и странам-получателям, по типам финансирования и по типам предоставленных ресурсов. Данные доступны практически по всем странам с высоким уровнем дохода в качестве двусторонних доноров и по растущему числу поставщиков помощи со средним уровнем дохода, а также по многосторонним кредитным учреждениям. Методологию сбора данных ОПР ОЭСР можно найти здесь: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm&quot;&gt; http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/ methodology.htm &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Данные будут дополнены отчетностью по комплексному управлению водными ресурсами (КУВР) в рамках задачи 6.5 ЦУР (в отношении сточных вод и качества воды, повышения эффективности водопользования, управления водными ресурсами и состояния связанных с водой экосистем) (ЮНЕП, 2016 год). Анализ КУВР проводился в прошлом издании «ООН-Водные ресурсы» за 2008 год (под руководством ООН-ДЭСВ) и за 2012 год (под руководством ЮНЕП, ПРООН, Глобального водного партнерства (ГВП) и Стокгольмского международного института водных ресурсов (SIWI)) по запросу Комиссии ООН по устойчивому развитию (ООН-Водные ресурсы 2008, 2012 годы).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Процесс сбора: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Национальные правительства, участвующие в обследовании, посвященном Глобальному анализу и оценке состояния санитарии и питьевого водоснабжения в рамках Механизма «ООН – Водные ресурсы» ГЛAAС, заполняют вопросник, желательно при участии многих заинтересованных сторон. Хотя процесс возглавляет одно министерство (например, министерство водных ресурсов, министерство окружающей среды и т. д., в зависимости от страны), часто бывает так, что в процесс должны быть вовлечены многие различные министерства и ведомства, чтобы получить данные, необходимые для заполнения вопросника. Национальный координатор ГЛААС оказывает помощь ведущему министерству в координации сбора данных, в процессе заполнения национального вопросника и в руководстве процессом валидации данных. Для каждого представления информации для ГЛААС собирается информация о процессах в стране (количество задействованных министерств, проводилось ли встреча национальных экспертов для оказания помощи в заполнении вопросника, процесс валидации с участием заинтересованных сторон, использование документации и т. д.). После получения вопросника от страны он подвергается тщательному процессу валидации данных, который часто является повторным процессом, требующим взаимодействия и обратной связи с региональными и страновыми партнерами. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Странам также предлагается дать согласие на публикацию отдельных подтвержденных данных, представленных в ГЛААС. Таким образом, ожидается, что благодаря процессам сбора, валидации и консультаций результаты будут сопоставимы и никаких дальнейших корректировок не предвидится.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Календарь &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Сбор данных: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Текущий раунд ГЛААС запущен и к концу 2016 года будут доступны данные о выплатах ОПР за 2015 год, проходящих через национальные государственные бюджеты. Данные ОЭСР по выплатам ОПР за 2015 год будут доступны через Систему отчетности кредиторов (СОК) в декабре 2016 года. (От NA до NA) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Выпуск данных: &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Название: &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Описание: &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Объем официальной помощи в целях развития (ОПР), связанной с водоснабжением и санитарией, является поддающимся количественной оценке показателем &quot;международного сотрудничества и поддержки развития потенциала&quot; с финансовой точки зрения. Очень важно иметь возможность оценивать ОПР пропорционально тому, какая часть ее включена в государственный бюджет, чтобы лучше понять, связаны ли доноры с национальными правительствами, заостряя внимание на общих выплатах ОПР в области водоснабжения и санитарии развивающимся странам с течением времени. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Небольшое значение этого показателя (около 0%) предполагает, что международные доноры вкладывают средства в мероприятия и программы, связанные с водоснабжением и санитарией в стране, но эти мероприятия и программы находятся за пределами компетенции национального правительства. Большое значение (около 100%) означает, что доноры связаны с национальным правительством и национальной политикой и планами в области водоснабжения и санитарии. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Комментарии и ограничения: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Данные по ОПР, связанной с водоснабжением и санитарией, включенной в государственный бюджет, будут доступны к концу 2016 года в рамках текущего цикла сбора данных для Глобального анализа и оценки состояния санитарии и питьевой воды (GLAAS) &quot;ООН-Водные ресурсы&quot;. До тех пор будут представляться данные по общему объему ОПР, связанной с водоснабжением и санитарией (знаменатель). Общий объем ОПР, связанной с водоснабжением и санитарией, будет по-прежнему представляться в качестве дополнительного показателя. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Кроме того, в качестве дополнительного показателя будет представляться доля ОПР, направляемая через государственное казначейство. ОПР, направляемая через казначейство, свидетельствует о высоком уровне сотрудничества и согласованности между донорами и национальным правительством, при котором доноры направляют средства через национальный бюджетный процесс. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Система отчетности кредиторов (СОК) ОЭСР в настоящее время разделяет ОПР для водоснабжения и санитарии по нескольким категориям, включая: отраслевую политику и управление, защиту водных ресурсов, крупные и базовые системы водоснабжения и канализации, инфраструктуру речных бассейнов, обработку отходов, ресурсы водоснабжения для сельскохозяйственных нужд, образование и обучение. Хотя эти категории не связаны напрямую с целевыми областями ЦУР 6 по отдельности, что ограничивает разбивку ОПР по целевым областям ЦУР, но совокупная ОПР этих категорий действительно связана с большей частью представленной в отчетах ОПР водному сектору.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Поскольку числитель и знаменатель взяты из разных источников, существует возможность различных основополагающих предположений относительно того, что должно быть включено / исключено из данных по ОПР. Это может привести к ситуациям, когда доля ОПР, включенная в государственный бюджет, будет больше 1 (100%), если общий объем ОПР, представленной в отчетах в ОЭСР, ниже, чем представленная в отчетах ОПР, включенная в бюджет. Чтобы избежать такой ситуации, ОЭСР предоставит ГЛААС отчетные данные по ОПР с разбивкой по уровням проектов, чтобы респонденты могли сопоставить их с данными своих бюджетных проектов. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ОПР представляет собой лишь один аспект международного сотрудничества. Чтобы охватить другие направления, доступны дополнительные вспомогательные показатели, в том числе показатели совместных действий, определенных Партнерством «Санитария и водные ресурсы для всех» (СВВ). Каждое действие имеет один или два ключевых показателя для правительств и партнеров по развитию. Если действия будут совместно внедряться правительствами и партнерами по развитию, то долгосрочные показатели и устойчивость сектора улучшатся. Для получения дополнительной информации о совместных действиях см. &lt;a href=&quot;http://sanitationandwaterforall.org/about/the-four-swa-collaborative-behaviours/&quot;&gt; http://sanitationandwaterforall.org/about/the-four-swa-collaborative-behaviours/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Методология &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Метод расчета: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Показатель рассчитывается как доля общей ОПР, связанной с водоснабжением и санитарией, которая включена в государственный бюджет, т. е. объем ОПР, связанной с водоснабжением и санитарией, в государственном бюджете, деленной на общий объем ОПР, связанной с водоснабжением и санитарией. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Числитель, в котором отражается ОПР, связанная с водоснабжением и санитарией, в государственном бюджете будет получен из материалов обследования &quot;Глобальный анализ и оценка состояния санитарии и питьевого водоснабжения в рамках Механизма «ООН – Водные ресурсы» (ГЛAAС), проведенного в 2016-2017 годах. Вопрос о внешнем финансировании собирает данные по сумме донорских средств, которые были включены в государственный бюджет. Данные по выплатам ОПР в 2015 году, получаемые с помощью ГЛААС, будут доступны к концу 2016 года. Диапазон вопроса о внешнем финансировании был расширен за пределы водоснабжения, санитарии и гигиены (ВСГ) в цикле обследования в 2016-17 годах для решения всех задач в рамках ЦУР 6, включая сточные воды и качество воды, повышение эффективности водопользования, управление водными ресурсами и связанные с водой экосистемы. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Знаменатель, в котором отражаются общие выплаты ОПР, связанные с водоснабжением и санитарией, будет получен с помощью Системы отчетности кредиторов (СОК) ОЭСР (целевые коды серии 14000 для сектора водных ресурсов и целевой код 31140 для сельскохозяйственных водных ресурсов). Данные по выплатам ОПР за 2015 год будут доступны с помощью СОК в декабре 2016 года. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Обработка отсутствующих значений: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt; На страновом уровне: &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Вследствие того, что выплаты ОПР сильно зависят от страны и контекста, а также от того, связаны ли они с планами национального правительства, оценки по странам, по которым отсутствуют данные, не производятся.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt; На региональном и глобальном уровнях: &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Если не представлены данные по размеру ОПР, включенной в бюджет, то страна исключается из регионального и / или глобального анализа. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Региональные агрегаты: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Глобальные и региональные агрегированные показатели ОПР получены на основе суммирования выплат ОПР странам-получателям для сектора водных ресурсов (целевые коды серии 14000) и водных ресурсов сельского хозяйства (целевой код 31140) из Системы отчетности кредиторов ОЭСР. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Глобальные и региональные доли выплат ОПР как части государственного бюджета рассчитываются для стран на основе суммирования ОПР для сектора водных ресурсов, которая включена в бюджет, деленная на сумму общей ОПР для сектора водных ресурсов. Расчет глобальных и региональных агрегированных показателей будет выполняться только для тех стран, которые отчитываются об объеме ОПР для сектора водных ресурсов, включенной в бюджет. Если данные по размеру ОПР в бюджете не представлены, то страна исключается из регионального и / или глобального анализа. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Доступные странам методы и руководства для составления данных на национальном уровне: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Вопросники для поставщиков помощи в целях развития доступны по следующей ссылке: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/&quot;&gt; http://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/&lt;/a&gt;. Данные, включенные в показатель, представляет собой потоки ОПР от всех доноров в развивающиеся страны, имеющие право на ОПР для сектора водных ресурсов (водоснабжение и санитария (целевые коды серии 14000), водные ресурсы сельского хозяйства (целевой код 31140), предотвращение / борьба с наводнениями (целевой код 41050) и гидроэлектростанции (целевой код 23220)). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Комитет содействия развитию ОЭСР (КСР) собирает данные по потокам помощи с 1973 года с использованием Системы отчетности кредиторов ОЭСР на основе стандартной методологии и согласованных определений от стран-членов и других поставщиков помощи. Данные обычно получают на уровне видов деятельности и включают множество параметров, позволяющих дезагрегировать их по поставщикам и странам-получателям, по типам финансирования и по типам предоставленных ресурсов. Данные доступны практически по всем странам с высоким уровнем дохода в качестве двусторонних доноров и по растущему числу поставщиков помощи со средним уровнем дохода, а также по многосторонним кредитным учреждениям. Методологию ОЭСР по сбору данных по ОПР можно найти здесь: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm&quot;&gt; http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Обеспечение качества: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Данные собираются с использованием конвергентной системы отчетности, при которой двусторонние и многосторонние поставщики помощи в целях развития используюFт единый формат файла (Система отчетности кредиторов - СОК) для отчетности на уровне отдельных элементов обо всех потоках ресурсов в развивающиеся страны. Отчетность на уровне элементов проверяется по ключевым агрегированным показателям, также представленной донорами, и затем служит основой для получения различных других агрегированных статистических данных. Для получения дополнительной информации см. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm&quot;&gt; http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Составитель статистики отвечает за сбор статистических данных Комитета содействия развитию (КСР) в каждой стране / агентстве-поставщике. Этот составитель обычно находится в национальном агентстве по оказанию помощи, Министерстве иностранных дел или финансов и т. д. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Доступность данных &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Описание: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt; Азиатско-Тихоокеанский регион: &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; Большинство стран (не менее 80% стран, охватывающих 90% населения региона) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt; Африка &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;: большинство стран (не менее 80% стран, охватывающих 90% населения региона) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt; Латинская Америка и Карибский бассейн &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;: большинство стран (не менее 80% стран, охватывающих 90% населения региона) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt; Европа, Северная Америка, Австралия, Новая Зеландия и Япония &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;: некоторые страны &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Обратите внимание, что они отражают наличие данных по общему объему ОПР в области водоснабжения и санитарии. Данные по доле, включенной в государственный бюджет, будут доступны в рамках текущего цикла процесса ГЛААС (см. 7.1, 10.1 и 10.2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Временные ряды: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Временные ряды параметров по показателю доступны для данных за 2008, 2010, 2012 и 2014 годы. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Дезагрегирование: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Дезагрегирование доступно по подсекторам (базовые против больших систем) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Источники расхождений: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Могут быть различия в том, какой объем помощи в целях развития включается в отчет страной-получателем, и объемом ОПР, выплаченной этой стране, согласно отчету ОЭСР-СОК. В то время как ОЭСР охватывает значительную часть потоков помощи (по отчетам внешних доноров) в сектор водоснабжения и санитарии, страны могут получать помощь в целях развития в области водоснабжения и санитарии от национальных и международных доноров, которые не отчитываются перед системой данных ОЭСР-СОК. Другие различия могут возникнуть, если страны-получатели определяют помощь в целях развития более или менее строго, чем приведено в определение ОПР ОЭСР, или используют другие временные рамки (например, финансовый год вместо календарного) для отчетности о потоках помощи. Чтобы обеспечить максимальную согласованность данных, ОЭСР предоставит отчетные данные по ОПР с разбивкой по уровням проектов, чтобы респонденты могли сопоставить их с данными своих бюджетных проектов.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Ссылки &lt;/h1&gt;
