	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 was adopted by UN Member States in March 2015 as a global policy of disaster risk reduction. One of the targets is: &amp;#x201C;Substantially increase the number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020&amp;#x201D;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, disaster risk reduction strategies and policies should mainstream and integrate disaster risk reduction within and across all sectors, across different timescales and with targets, indicators and time frames. These strategies should be aimed at preventing the creation of disaster risk, the reduction of existing risk and the strengthening of economic, social, health and environmental resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to disaster risk reduction (OIEWG) established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) has developed a set of indicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework, which was endorsed by the UNGA (OIEWG &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.preventionweb.net/publications/view/51748&quot;&gt;report A/71/644&lt;/a&gt;). The relevant SDG indicators reflect the Sendai Framework indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
