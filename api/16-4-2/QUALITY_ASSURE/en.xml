	<data>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The data received from Member States goes through a thorough internal validation process. The IAFQ already has a built-in validation procedure that allows the respondent to see on the spot whether the reported values add up to the corresponding totals reported in other parts of the questionnaire. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Internal validation is also performed automatically in the internal database system.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The data is also externally validated by comparing it to other (preferably official) available sources. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once the information has been validated and information from additional sources incorporated, it is shared with Member States for their approval. After Member States have approved the corresponding values, data are ready to be published and sub-regional, regional and global totals are ready to be estimated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</data>
