	<message>The REG_AGG field for indicator 16-4-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Once values of indicators for countries have been imputed, the sub-regional, regional and global estimates will be obtained by separately adding the numerator and denominator values for countries within a specific sub-region and region, and calculating the proportion.
