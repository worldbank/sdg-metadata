In particular, UNODA and UNODC will request further information directly to the relevant Focal Points.</p>\n<p>In the absence of feedback, supplementary and alternative sources would be consulted to obtain the missing information. This information will be shared with the Member State for their approval.</p>\n<p>Finally, if no additional information is available through these two channels, the country&#x2019;s indicator will not be published. </p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>\n<p>In order to calculate regional and global levels, the indicator for those Member States that were not published after treatment at the country level, will be estimated using information from alternative sources and/or from similar countries. The selection of these &#x201C;similar countries&#x201D; will be based on geographical location (e.g. regional or sub-regional averages), and/or structural similarities, such as the proportion of uniquely marked arms seized or the total number of arms seized, found and surrendered per capita. As historical data for countries becomes available with time, it will be possible to impute using the same country&#x2019;s data as well.</p>\n<p>There will be certain thresholds to be met for the regional and global estimates to be acceptable. If these thresholds are not met, the estimates will not be published.</p>\n<p>Since the IAFQ and PoA National Reports are more likely to provide information on the denominator than the numerator, in many countries only the latter will need to be estimated. Estimates for both the denominator and the numerator will be separately created. </p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
