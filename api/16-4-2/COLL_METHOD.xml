&lt;p&gt;The official counterparts at the country level are designated Focal Points that are in charge of coordinating the data collection among different national institutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supplementary data are collected on a biennial basis through the PoA National reports (as revised in 2018) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from alternative sources is collected throughout the year and incorporated into the internal database in parallel to the data collections above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After data is consolidated, it is finally shared with Member States for their review before publication. &lt;/p&gt;
