For example, cases where tracing is still pending or there was not enough information to establish the point of diversion, could be disaggregated from the cases where there was no attempt to trace the weapon whatsoever. </li>\n  <li>By whether the illicit origin was determined through tracing or established by a competent authority. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, it would be possible to compute the indicator for the &#x201C;population&#x201D; of seized, found and surrendered arms that are uniquely identifiable.</p>"}
