	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 16-4-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IAFQ data collection started in 2018 and countries are expected to submit their responses between June and October 2018. It is expected that the number respondents will gradually increase over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty-six States have provided information in their PoA National reports, which will be used as supplementary information for the calculation of the denominator of indicator 16.4.2 (see at www.smallarms.un-arm.com/sustainable-development-goals)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collected data allows for the annual calculation of indicator 16.4.2 at the national level, which can be aggregated to sub-regional, regional and global levels. Disaggregating the indicator by a number of variables is also possible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By arms seized, arms found and arms surrendered.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By different &amp;#x201C;levels of tracing&amp;#x201D; in cases where tracing was not successful. For example, cases where tracing is still pending or there was not enough information to establish the point of diversion, could be disaggregated from the cases where there was no attempt to trace the weapon whatsoever. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By whether the illicit origin was determined through tracing or established by a competent authority. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it would be possible to compute the indicator for the &amp;#x201C;population&amp;#x201D; of seized, found and surrendered arms that are uniquely identifiable.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
