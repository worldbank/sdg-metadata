	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 13-1-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Note: Computation methodology for several indicators is very comprehensive, very long (about 180 pages) and probably out of the scope of this Metadata. UNISDR prefers to refer to the outcome of the Open Ended Intergovernmental Working Group, which provides a full detailed methodology for each indicator and sub-indicator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest version of these methodologies can be obtained at:&lt;/p&gt;
