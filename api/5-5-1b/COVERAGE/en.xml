	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 5-5-1b, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on women&amp;#x2019;s and men&amp;#x2019;s representation in elected positions of legislative/ deliberative bodies of local government are currently estimated as available for 89 countries in the world. This estimate is based on a count of countries covered by regional databases in Europe, Latin America, and the Caribbean, and ad-hoc studies in Asia and the Pacific. However, the indicator used varies from one region to another. The count of countries is expected to change after the methodology of the indicator is used consistently across countries and regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year in the time series shows data for countries with new elections or new data sources in previous year. By default, reference date is 1 January and exceptions are indicated in the footnotes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on elected positions in legislative/deliberative bodies of local government must be disaggregated by sex to enable the calculation of the indicator. No additional disaggregation is required for SDG reporting.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
