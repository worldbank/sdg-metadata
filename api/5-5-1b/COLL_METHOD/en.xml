	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 5-5-1b, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The compilation of data, coordinated by UN Women and undertaken with the support of UN Regional Commissions, uses two mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;data request forms sent to EMBs and NSOs directly or through UN Regional Commissions &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;on-line dissemination of data by NSS entities who are the primary source of data or in charge with coordination of SDGs, including EMBs and/or NSOs. This process will be done in a transparent manner, based on communication with NSS focal points, so that the NSS has a chance to validate or dismiss a country&amp;#x2019;s compiled data. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</data>
