	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 3-b-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The rational to select a set of vaccines reflects the ability of immunization programmes to deliver vaccines over the life cycle and to adapt new vaccines. Coverage for other WHO recommended vaccines are also available and can be provided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that HPV vaccine is relatively new and vaccination schedule varies from countries to country coverage estimate will be made for girls vaccinated by ag 15 and at the moment data is limited to very few countries therefore reporting will start later. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
