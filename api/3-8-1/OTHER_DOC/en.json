The JMP assembles, reviews and assesses national data collected by statistics offices and other relevant institutions including sectoral authorities. Linear regression is used to provide estimates of the population using improved sanitation facilities, as well as the proportion practising open defecation. Regressions are also made to estimate the population using improved sanitation facilities connected to sewers and septic tanks; these are constrained to not exceed the estimates for total improved facilities. The proportion of the population sharing sewered and non-sewered sanitation facilities is estimated by making a linear regression on all available data on sharing from household surveys and censuses. Basic sanitation services are calculated by multiplying the proportion of the population using improved sanitation facilities by the proportion of improved sanitation facilities which are not shared among two or more households. Separate estimates are made for urban and rural areas, and national estimates are generated as weighted averages of the two, using population data from the most recent report of the United Nations Population Division. The most recent household survey or census available for most countries was typically conducted two to six years ago. The JMP extrapolates regressions for two years beyond the last available data point. Beyond this point the estimates remain unchanged for up to four years unless coverage is below 0.5 per cent or above 99.5 per cent, in which case the line is extended indefinitely.

A full description of the method is available as a peer-reviewed article in The Lancet, volume 385, No. 9972, p966&#x2013;976 (2015). Once the age-and-sex-specific prevalence rates from national surveys were compiled into a dataset, the model was fit to calculate trend estimates from the year 2000 to 2025. The model has two main components: (a) adjusting for missing indicators and age groups, and (b) generating an estimate of trends over time as well as the 95% credible interval around the estimate. Depending on the completeness/comprehensiveness of survey data from a particular country, the model at times makes use of data from other countries to fill information gaps. When a country has fewer than two nationally representative population-based surveys in different years, no attempt is made to fill data gaps and no estimates are calculated. To fill data gaps, information is &#x201C;borrowed&#x201D; from countries in the same UN subregion. The resulting trend lines are used to derive estimates for single years, so that a number can be reported even if the country did not run a survey in that year. In order to make the results comparable between countries, the prevalence rates are age-standardized to the WHO Standard Population. Estimates for countries with irregular surveys or many data gaps will have large uncertainty ranges, and such results should be interpreted with caution.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>UHC-related notes</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Prevalence of tobacco non-use is computed as 1 minus the prevalence of tobacco use.

This rescaling is done in the same way as that for the hospital bed density indicator described above, resulting in indicator values that range from 0 to 100 for each of the three cadres. For example, using country data on physicians per 1000 population (<em>x</em>), the cadre-specific indicator would be computed as:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Country with <em>x</em> &lt; 0.9 per 1000 per year, the cadre-specific indicator = <em>x</em> /0.9*100. </li>\n          <li>Country with <em>x</em> &gt;= 0.9 per 1000 per year, the cadre-specific indicator = 100.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>As a final step, the geometric mean of the three cadre-specific indicator values is computed to obtain the final indicator of health workforce density.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>UHC-related notes</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Due to major challenges measuring coverage in all health areas, which leaves major gaps for important areas such as routine medical exams, treatment for mental illnesses, emergency care and surgical procedure, proxies are used.

It should be noted that those measures are difficult to interpret because the optimal level for those indicators is unknown and they do not relate to a specific need for services. Despite this fact, low levels for these indicators are indicative of poor access to and use of essential health services.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Tracer area</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Health security</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Indicator definition</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>International Health Regulations (IHR) core capacity index, which is the average percentage of attributes of all core capacities that have been attained at a specific point in time. </p>\n        <p>The second edition SPAR tool has been expanded from 13 to 15 capacities.

Individual questions are grouped by components and indicators in the questionnaires. States Parties can provide additional information on the questions in the comment boxes. Responses to the questions include marking one appropriate value (Yes, No, or Not Known) or the appropriate percentages. For statistical purposes, the &quot;Not Known&quot; value will be computed as a &quot;No&quot; value. The IHR monitoring questionnaire includes the following: IHR01. National legislation, policy and financing; IHR02. Coordination and National Focal Point communications; IHR03. Surveillance; IHR04. Response; IHR05. Preparedness; IHR06. Risk communication; IHR07.
