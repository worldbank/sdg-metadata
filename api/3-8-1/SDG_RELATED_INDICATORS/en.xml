	<message>The SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS field for indicator 3-8-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The UHC service coverage index is designed to summarize existing indicators of health service coverage to ensure consistency with the SDGs and other global initiatives and reduce duplication and reporting burden. Currently, two other SDG indicators are included in the index (3.a.1 and 3.d.1). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicator 3.8.1 should always be interpreted together with the other SDG UHC indicator, 3.8.2, which measures financial protection.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
