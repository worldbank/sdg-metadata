The JMP assembles, reviews and assesses national data collected by statistics offices and other relevant institutions including sectoral authorities. Linear regression is used to provide estimates of the population using improved sanitation facilities, as well as the proportion practising open defecation. Regressions are also made to estimate the population using improved sanitation facilities connected to sewers and septic tanks; these are constrained to not exceed the estimates for total improved facilities. The proportion of the population sharing sewered and non-sewered sanitation facilities is estimated by making a linear regression on all available data on sharing from household surveys and censuses. Basic sanitation services are calculated by multiplying the proportion of the population using improved sanitation facilities by the proportion of improved sanitation facilities which are not shared among two or more households. Separate estimates are made for urban and rural areas, and national estimates are generated as weighted averages of the two, using population data from the most recent report of the United Nations Population Division. The most recent household survey or census available for most countries was typically conducted two to six years ago. The JMP extrapolates regressions for two years beyond the last available data point. Beyond this point the estimates remain unchanged for up to four years unless coverage is below 0.5 per cent or above 99.5 per cent, in which case the line is extended indefinitely.

A full description of the method is available as a peer-reviewed article in The Lancet, volume 385, No. 9972, p966&#x2013;976 (2015). Once the age-and-sex-specific prevalence rates from national surveys were compiled into a dataset, the model was fit to calculate trend estimates from the year 2000 to 2025. The model has two main components: (a) adjusting for missing indicators and age groups, and (b) generating an estimate of trends over time as well as the 95% credible interval around the estimate. Depending on the completeness/comprehensiveness of survey data from a particular country, the model at times makes use of data from other countries to fill information gaps. When a country has fewer than two nationally representative population-based surveys in different years, no attempt is made to fill data gaps and no estimates are calculated. To fill data gaps, information is &#x201C;borrowed&#x201D; from countries in the same UN subregion. The resulting trend lines are used to derive estimates for single years, so that a number can be reported even if the country did not run a survey in that year. In order to make the results comparable between countries, the prevalence rates are age-standardized to the WHO Standard Population. Estimates for countries with irregular surveys or many data gaps will have large uncertainty ranges, and such results should be interpreted with caution.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>UHC-related notes</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Prevalence of tobacco non-use is computed as 1 minus the prevalence of tobacco use.

This rescaling is done in the same way as that for the hospital bed density indicator described above, resulting in indicator values that range from 0 to 100 for each of the three cadres. For example, using country data on physicians per 1000 population (<em>x</em>), the cadre-specific indicator would be computed as:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Country with <em>x</em> &lt; 0.9 per 1000 per year, the cadre-specific indicator = <em>x</em> /0.9*100. </li>\n          <li>Country with <em>x</em> &gt;= 0.9 per 1000 per year, the cadre-specific indicator = 100.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>As a final step, the geometric mean of the three cadre-specific indicator values is computed to obtain the final indicator of health workforce density.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>UHC-related notes</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Due to major challenges measuring coverage in all health areas, which leaves major gaps for important areas such as routine medical exams, treatment for mental illnesses, emergency care and surgical procedure, proxies are used.

La vacuna que contiene difteria-tétanos-tos ferina suele incluir otras vacunas, por ejemplo, contra la hepatitis B y el Haemophilus influenza tipo B, y es una medida razonable del grado de solidez de la plataforma de vacunación de un país.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Área del trazador</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Tratamiento de niños (búsqueda de atención por síntomas de neumonía).</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Definición del indicador</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Porcentaje de niños menores de 5 años con sospecha de neumonía (tos y dificultad para respirar NO debidas a un problema en el pecho y a una nariz tapada) en las dos semanas anteriores a la encuesta llevados a un centro o proveedor de salud adecuado.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>.\n        <p>Numerador</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Número de niños con sospecha de neumonía en las dos semanas anteriores a la encuesta llevados a un proveedor de salud adecuado.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Denominador</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Número de niños con sospecha de neumonía en las dos semanas anteriores a la encuesta.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Principales fuentes de datos</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Encuestas de hogares.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Método de medición</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Durante la Reunión de UNICEF/OMS sobre indicadores basados en encuestas de supervivencia infantil, celebrada en Nueva York el 17&#x2013;18 de junio de 2004, se recomendó que las infecciones respiratorias agudas (IRA) se describieran como &#x201C;presunta neumonía&#x201D; para reflejar mejor la causa probable y las intervenciones recomendadas.

La régression linéaire est utilisée pour fournir des estimations de la population utilisant des installations sanitaires améliorées, ainsi que la proportion pratiquant la défécation à l'air libre. Des régressions sont également effectuées pour estimer la population utilisant des installations sanitaires améliorées reliées aux égouts et aux fosses septiques; celles-ci sont contraints de ne pas dépasser les estimations du nombre total d'installations améliorées. La proportion de la population partageant des installations sanitaires avec et sans égouts est estimée en prenant une moyenne de toutes les données disponibles sur le partage provenant d'enquêtes et de recensements auprès des ménages. Les services sanitaires de base sont calculés en multipliant la proportion de la population utilisant des installations sanitaires améliorées par la proportion d'installations sanitaires améliorées qui ne sont pas partagées entre deux ménages ou plus. Des estimations distinctes sont faites pour les zones urbaines et rurales, et les estimations nationales sont générées sous forme de moyennes pondérées des deux, en utilisant les données démographiques du rapport le plus récent de la Division de la population des Nations Unies. L'enquête auprès des ménages ou le recensement le plus récent disponible pour la plupart des pays a généralement été réalisé il y a deux à six ans. Le Programme conjoint extrapole les régressions sur deux ans au-delà du dernier point de données disponible. Au-delà de ce point, les estimations restent inchangées jusqu'à quatre ans, sauf si la couverture est inférieure à 0,5 % ou supérieure à 99,5 %, auquel cas la limite est prolongée indéfiniment.

Une description complète de la méthode est disponible dans un article évalué par des pairs dans The Lancet, volume 385, n° 9972, p966-976 (2015). Une fois que les taux de prévalence par âge et par sexe des enquêtes nationales ont été compilés dans un ensemble de données, le modèle a été adapté pour calculer les estimations de tendance de l'année 2000 à 2025. Le modèle comporte deux composantes principales : (a) ajustement pour les indicateurs manquants et groupes d'âge, et (b) générer une estimation des tendances dans le temps ainsi que l'intervalle de confiance à 95 % autour de l'estimation. Selon l'intégralité/l'exhaustivité des données d'enquête d'un pays en particulier, le modèle utilise parfois des données d'autres pays pour combler les lacunes en matière d'information. Lorsqu'un pays a réalisé moins de deux enquêtes nationales représentatives de la population au cours d'années différentes, aucune tentative n'est faite pour combler les lacunes dans les données et aucune estimation n'est calculée. Pour combler les lacunes dans les données, les informations sont « empruntées » aux pays de la même sous-région des Nations Unies. Les lignes de tendance résultantes sont utilisées pour dériver des estimations pour des années individuelles, de sorte qu'un nombre peut être rapporté même si le pays n'a pas mené d'enquête cette année-là. Afin de rendre les résultats comparables entre les pays, les taux de prévalence sont normalisés selon l'âge par rapport à la population type de l'OMS. Les estimations pour les pays avec des enquêtes irrégulières ou de nombreuses lacunes dans les données auront de larges intervalles d'incertitude, et ces résultats doivent être interprétés avec prudence. </p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Notes au sujet de la CSU</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>La prévalence de ne pas fumer de tabac est calculée comme 1 moins la\nprévalence de fumer du tabac. </p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Indicateur traceur</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Accès à l’hôpital</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Indicator definition</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Lits d’hôpital par habitant, par rapport à un seuil maximum de 18 pour\n10 000 habitants</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Numérateur</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Nombre de lits d'hôpital (devrait exclure les lits pour le travail et\npour l'accouchement)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Dénominateur</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Population totale </p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Sources principales de données</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Systèmes administratifs / Système de déclaration des établissements de\nsanté</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Méthode de mesure</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Les systèmes administratifs des pays sont utilisés pour totaliser le\nnombre de lits d'hôpitaux, qui est divisé par la population totale estimée et multiplié par 10 000. </p>\n        <p>Les bureaux régionaux de l'OMS et d'autres groupes recueillent des informations\nsur la densité nationale des lits d'hôpitaux, y compris les ressources en ligne suivantes :</p>\n        <p>Observatoire régional de l'OMS « EMRO » : https://rho.emro.who.int/rhodata/node.main.A36</p>\n        <p>Observatoire régional de l'OMS « AFRO » : http://www.aho.afro.who.int/en/data-statistics/hospital-beds-10-000-population</p>\n        <p>Base de données de l'OMS « EURO European Health for All » : https://gateway.euro.who.int/en/datasets/european-health-for-all-database/</p>\n        <p>OCDE: https://data.oecd.org/healtheqt/hospital-beds.htm</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Méthode d'estimation</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>À partir des données disponibles, l'indicateur est calculé par rapport\nà une valeur seuil de 18 lits d'hôpitaux pour 10 000 habitants.

Вакцина против дифтерии, столбняка и коклюша часто включает другие вакцины, например, против гепатита B и гемофильной инфекции типа B, и является разумным отражением того, до какой степени создана надежная платформа вакцинирования в стране. </p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Область контроля</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Лечение детей (обращение за помощью при симптомах пневмонии)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Определение показателя</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Доля детей в возрасте до 5 лет с подозрением на пневмонию (кашель и затрудненное дыхание, НЕ из-за проблем в грудной клетке и заложенного носа) в течение двух недель, предшествующих обследованию, доставленных в соответствующее медицинское учреждение или к медработнику.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Числитель</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Количество детей с подозрением на пневмонию в течение двух недель, предшествующих обследованию, доставленных к соответствующему медработнику.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Знаменатель</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Количество детей с подозрением на пневмонию за две недели, предшествующие обследованию.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Основные источники данных</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Обследования домохозяйств</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Метод измерения</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>На совещании ЮНИСЕФ / ВОЗ по показателям выживаемости детей, состоявшемся в Нью-Йорке 17-18 июня 2004 года, было рекомендовано описывать острые респираторные инфекции (ОРИ) как «предполагаемую пневмонию», чтобы лучше отразить вероятную причину и рекомендуемые методы лечения.
