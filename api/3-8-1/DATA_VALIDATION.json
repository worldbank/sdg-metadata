However, a quality assessment is performed before consulting countries (i.e. detection of important outliers or substantial difference between last update and next update for the same year). The index estimates are included in a consultation to obtain country&#x2019;s feedback. Data are revised as needed for antenatal care coverage and hospital beds densities. The revision of all the other indicators should follow the reporting mechanism already in place. </p>\n<p>Information on the validation of the index construction can be found in the following paper: <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(17)30472-2/fulltext\">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(17)30472-2/fulltext</a></p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
