	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 3-8-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Target 3.8 is defined as &amp;#x201C;Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all&amp;#x201D;. The objective is for all people and communities to receive the quality health services they need (including medicines and other health products), without financial hardship. Two indicators have been chosen to monitor target 3.8 within the SDG framework. Indicator 3.8.1 is for health service coverage and indicator 3.8.2 focuses on health expenditures in relation to a household&amp;#x2019;s budget to identify financial hardship caused by direct health care payments. Taken together, indicators 3.8.1 and 3.8.2 are meant to capture the service coverage and financial protection dimensions, respectively, of target 3.8. These two indicators should be always monitored jointly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries provide many essential services for health protection, promotion, prevention, treatment and care. Indicators of service coverage &amp;#x2013; defined as people receiving the service they need &amp;#x2013; are the best way to track progress in providing services under universal health coverage (UHC). Since a single health service indicator does not suffice for monitoring UHC, an index is constructed from 14 tracer indicators selected based on epidemiological and statistical criteria. This includes several indicators that are already included in other SDG targets, thereby minimizing the data collection and reporting burden. The index is reported on a unitless scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being the optimal value. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
