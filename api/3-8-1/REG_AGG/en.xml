	<data>&lt;p&gt;Regional and global aggregates use United Nations population estimates at the country level to compute a weighted average of country values for the index. This is justified because universal health coverage (UHC) is a property of countries, and the index of essential services is a summary measure of access to essential services for each country&amp;#x2019;s population. United Nations population estimates at country level are used to ensure consistency and comparability of estimates within countries and between countries over time. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
