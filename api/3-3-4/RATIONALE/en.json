Most of the burden of disease from HBV infection comes from infections acquired before the age of 5 years. Therefore, prevention of HBV infection focuses on children under 5 years of age. The United Nations selected the cumulative incidence of chronic HBV infection at 5 years of age as an indicator of the Sustainable Development Goal target for &#x201C;combating hepatitis&#x201D;. This indicator is measured indirectly through the proportion of children 5 years of age who have developed chronic HBV infection (i.e. the proportion that tests positive for a marker of infection called hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]). </p>"}
