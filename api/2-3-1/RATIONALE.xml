			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda has emphasized the importance of enhancing productivity of small-scale food producers, as these producers play an important role in the global production of food. The indicator monitors progress in this area, where the target is to double productivity by year 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enhancement of labour productivity in small-scale production units also has implications on poverty reduction, as small-scale food producers are often poor, and are frequently found to be close to subsistence conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
