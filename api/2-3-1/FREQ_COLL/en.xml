	<message>The FREQ_COLL field for indicator 2-3-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The data collection calendar depends on the frequency of surveys required to compute the indicators. FAO is engaging with countries to include the questions needed to measure the indicator into their existing national surveys, i.e., household-based surveys, agricultural surveys and censuses through capacity development activities at national/ regional levels and provision of technical assistance needed to compute the indicator.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
