  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At country level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous year is used when latest year is not available. Alternatively mirror statistics can be used. Mirror statistics is the term used to define statistics that are calculated using partner country information when data for the analysed country are not available. For instance, the export of a country X could be recalculated using mirror statistics through the imports from country X of all its partners. It has to be kept in mind however imports are often reported CIF (i.e. including the cost of freight and insurance) while export FoB (i.e. free on board). The difference between these two reporting systems should be taken into account when using import data to estimate exports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At regional and global levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
