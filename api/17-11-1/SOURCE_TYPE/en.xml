	<data>&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Trade in goods data included in the ITC (Trade Map) database are collected by contacting directly focal points in national agencies or regional organizations (in the case of custom unions or regional economic communities). Trade in goods data included in the WTO (IDB) database are sourced from official notifications of WTO members. Trade in goods data are complemented, when needed using the UN COMTRADE database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade in services data are sourced from a joint ITC/UNCTAD/WTO database, prevalently based on balance of payments accounts data maintained by the IMF, OECD and EUROSTAT. In some cases WTO jointly with UNCTAD collects information from national sources. Trade in services data can be retrieved by domestic banks and/or national statistic offices from one or more of the following sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Transaction Reporting System (ITRS). In this case, international payments channelled through domestic banks are collected, generally, under the responsibility of the national central bank. Payments are used as a proxy of transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enterprise surveys. Generally, under the responsibility of the national statistical office.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
