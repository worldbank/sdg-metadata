  &lt;li&gt;Statistics received from Member States will go through a validation process. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The data for the indicator are externally validated by comparing to other available sources. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once the information has been validated and information from additional sources incorporated, any questions for clarification or proposals are shared with Member States for their review. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In case any adjustment is needed, after Member States have reviewed the values, indicators are ready to be published and sub-regional, regional and global totals, where appropriate, can be estimated.&lt;/li&gt;
