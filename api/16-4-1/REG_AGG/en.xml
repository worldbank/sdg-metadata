	<message>The REG_AGG field for indicator 16-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Once values of country indicators have been released, missing indicators estimated, any sub-regional, regional and global estimates will be obtained by aggregating the country indicators within a specific sub-region and region. The global value would be calculated by aggregating the regional values in a similar manner. National differences in the comprehensiveness of IFF coverage will influence the quality of regional aggregates. Regional aggregations will be further methodologically developed once sufficient country-level statistics on IFFs become fully available. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
