	<message>The FREQ_COLL field for indicator 16-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;UNODC and UNCTAD are in the process of supporting Member States to strengthen their national capacity to measure the Indicator. Until 2022, 22 countries globally have tested methodologies to measure specific elements of the indicator with some preliminary statistics on IFFs being compiled. Some of them are ready for global reporting in early 2023. The work to expand the scope, i.e., coverage of both other elements of IFFs and other countries, is underway by custodian agencies and United Nations Regional Commissions. More detailed data collection plans will be made based on the outcomes of current consultations, pilot testing and ongoing capacity-strengthening projects.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
