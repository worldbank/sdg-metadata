{"status":"success","message":"The CLASS_SYSTEM field for indicator 16-4-1, translated into all languages","data":{"ar":"","en":"<p>Illicit financial flows (IFFs) are measured by identifying activities and behaviours that may generate them, such as those that are listed in the <em><u>UNODC (2015) International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes</u></em> (ICCS) <sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-ref-4\">[3]</a></sup> and those that relate to the area of aggressive tax avoidance in addition. ICCS provides definitions of a number of behaviours, events and activities which may generate IFFs such as exploitation-type activities and terrorism, trafficking activities and corruption, as well as many activities related to illicit tax and commercial practices. The ICCS, however, focuses solely on actions and behaviours that are attributable to different types of crime. The classification will be extended to cover all IFFs related to tax and commercial activities, namely IFFs related to aggressive tax avoidance. A draft of classifying tax and commercial activities extending from, but not indicating their inclusion in the ICCS, is presented below. Please note that codes 080413, 080414 and 080415 are not covered by the ICCS as they are clearly not criminal activities. Only an excerpt is shown for illustrative purposes as a more exhaustive classification is being developed. </p>\n<p><strong>Draft classification of tax and commercial IFFs</strong></p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Code</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>Inclusion/exclusion</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">\n        <p>08041<strong><u>1</u></strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">\n        <p>Acts of concealing revenues or wealth in order to evade taxation</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Inclusion</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Outright undeclared (concealed e.g., in secrecy jurisdictions); Undeclared via instruments (Phantom corporations or shell companies, tax havens)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Exclusion</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Fraud, deception or corruption (07)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">\n        <p>08041<strong><u>2</u></strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">\n        <p>Acts of fraudulently misdeclaring the object, the quantity or the value of traded goods in invoicing transactions</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Inclusion</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Under/over reporting prices; Multiple invoicing; Over/under reporting of quantities; Misclassification of tariff categories</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Exclusion</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Transfer misprincing (08041<strong><u>3</u></strong>)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">\n        <p>08041<strong><u>3*</u></strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">\n        <p>Acts departing from the arm&#x2019;s length principle</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Inclusion</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Setting up over/under priced exchange of goods and services with the intent of moving profits among MNEs units</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Exclusion</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Misinvoicing (08041<strong><u>2</u></strong>)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">\n        <p>08041<strong><u>4*</u></strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">\n        <p>Acts related to strategic location of debt, other financial assets, risks, or other corporate activities</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Inclusion</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Intracompany loans; Interest payments</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Exclusion</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Transfer misprincing (08041<strong><u>3</u></strong>)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">\n        <p>08041<strong><u>5*</u></strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">\n        <p>Acts related to strategic location of intellectual property products and other non-financial assets</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Inclusion</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Strategic location of intellectual property; Strategic location of other assets; Cost-sharing agreements; Royalty payments</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Exclusion</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Transfer misprincing (08041<strong><u>3</u></strong>)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>* Although extending from ICCS code 08041, these categories are not covered in ICCS (not criminal activities).</p>\n<p>A number of activities and behaviours are identified as potentially generating IFFs, both from tax and commercial, and illegal IFFs categories.
