	<message>The COMPILING_ORG field for indicator 16-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;At the national level, national statistical offices have a coordinating role in the national statistical system, and are, thus, well placed to lead the compilation work and bring the stakeholders together to measure IFFs. National statistical offices may either collate all relevant data to compile the SDG indicator, or coordinate the compilation of different types of IFFs among national authorities to form the overall SDG Indicator 16.4.1. UNODC and UNCTAD will collate the indicator data and report it globally.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
