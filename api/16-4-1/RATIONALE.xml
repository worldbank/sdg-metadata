			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;A major challenge to sustainable development of societies around the world, particularly in developing countries, is represented by several criminal activities and tax and commercial illicit practices which are at the origin or associated with illicit financial flows (IFFs). Proceeds from criminal activities are often transferred between countries to be laundered, utilized and reinvested in licit or illicit activities. IFFs can also originate from legal economic activities but become illicit when financial flows are managed or transferred illicitly; for instance, to evade taxes or to finance illegal activities. IFFs drain resources from sustainable development. Combatting IFFs is therefore a crucial component of the goal to promote peace, justice and strong institutions, as set out in Goal 16 of its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.&lt;/p&gt;
