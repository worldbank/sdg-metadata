{"status":"success","message":"The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 16-4-1, translated into en","data":"<p>The indicator builds on existing data, but its exhaustiveness may require extensions to national data collection. This includes both administrative and statistical data. Central banks, tax and customs authorities and national statistical offices often have the strongest mandate to access necessary data. This may be considered in the division of work for the compilation of different parts of indicator 16.4.1. The country-by-country reporting data of tax authorities, and other incentives to share economic data in statistically safe environments may prove useful for the measurement of illicit financial flows (IFFs) in the future. </p>\n<p>The agency in charge of data collection and compilation will vary across countries depending on the national division of labour and on the type of IFFs prominent in the country. As the coordinator of the national statistics system, the national statistical office is expected to act as the official counterpart and coordinator of work for most countries. </p>\n<p>If there are major inconsistencies across countries, with other existing data, or in relation to standard classifications and concepts, the custodian agencies will contact the designated Focal Points regarding any need for clarification, correction or additional metadata. Indicators are reviewed prior to global release following the procedures set by the IAEG-SDGs.</p>\n<p> </p>"}
