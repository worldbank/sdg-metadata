	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 16-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, countries are affected by different types of IFFs and varying data availability. Therefore, the coverage of different types of IFFs in the indicator may vary from one country to another, thus affecting comparability. However, the goal is to capture the largest flows even when country-specific solutions are applied. Furthermore, based on the country metadata, the custodian agencies may discuss necessary corrections or adjustments for producing regional and global aggregates with countries. A gradual process of improving the exhaustiveness of the indicator is expected, following the model of measuring illegal economic activities and the non-observed economy in the balance of payments and system of national accounts.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
