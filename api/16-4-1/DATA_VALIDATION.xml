			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;UNODC and UNCTAD will request member states to provide sufficient metadata accompanying their compiled IFFs estimates. Currently still work in progress, however, once finalised, the methodological guidelines will provide practical guidance to national statistical authorities, including suggested methodologies to measure IFFs. Deviations to account for national circumstances will clearly need to be identified, justified and their impact on international comparability and methodological comprehensiveness be estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
