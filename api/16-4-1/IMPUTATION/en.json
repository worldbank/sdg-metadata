{"status":"success","message":"The IMPUTATION field for indicator 16-4-1, translated into en","data":"<ul>\n  <li><strong>At country level</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>When national data are missing, transnational data sources or alternative data sources can be examined. It is important to provide comprehensive metadata explaining current issues related to missing data and exhaustiveness of the indicator. Although national data may only partially cover IFFs, they are still valuable for assessing the significance of IFFs globally and regionally. UNCTAD and UNODC may support countries to assess alternative sources for obtaining the missing information. </p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>At regional and global levels</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to calculate regional and global aggregates, missing data may be estimated using information from international sources. As historical data for countries become available with time, it will be possible to impute using the same country&#x2019;s data as well. Estimated indicators are not to be released at the country level, but only in aggregated form at regional and global levels. There will be certain thresholds to be met for the regional and global estimates to be acceptable. If these thresholds are not met, the regional and global estimates will not be published.</p>"}
