			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Given the compilation process outlined above, national circumstances will come at play when measuring the IFFs. The need for adjustment can be assessed based on information on the breakdowns included in the reported IFFs estimates (in the accompanying metadata). The goal is to base the Indicator on nationally compiled and reported data. Ongoing work on classification and aggregation of IFFs will result in further guidance on how to adjust for potential duplication and to harmonise breakdowns. &lt;/p&gt;
