	<message>The INST_MANDATE field for indicator 16-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;As described earlier, the national division of work varies across countries. Data relevant for IFFs are collected or accessed by different national authorities to fulfil their mandate. Often the national statistical office has the mandate to access data necessary for statistical production, including confidential data held by other national authorities, or to collect the data directly from respondents. The compilation of aggregates for different IFFs can also be decentralised reflecting the mandates of the relevant agencies. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
