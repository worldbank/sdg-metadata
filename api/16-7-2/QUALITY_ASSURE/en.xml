	<message>The QUALITY_ASSURE field for indicator 16-7-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;NSOs have the main responsibility to ensure the statistical quality of the data compiled for this indicator. One possible quality assurance mechanism would be to compare results obtained by the NSO with readily available survey results on external political efficacy generated by relevant national, regional or global unofficial data producers (see potential global and regional unofficial sources below).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
