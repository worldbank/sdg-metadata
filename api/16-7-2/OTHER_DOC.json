As such, the methodology for 16.7.2 consists in two separate survey questions addressing these two distinct dimensions, namely: </li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>To measure <u>inclusive</u> participation in decision-making: </strong><em>How much would you say the political system in [country X] allows people like you to <u>have a say</u> in what the government does?</em><strong><em> </em></strong></li>\n  <li><strong>To measure <u>responsive</u> decision-making: </strong><em>And how much would you say that the political system in [country] allows people like you to <u>have an influence</u> on politics?</em><strong><em> </em></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Questions to be incorporated in a support survey:</strong> These two questions to measure SDG 16.7.2 can be inserted into existing national surveys run by NSOs, using these surveys&#x2019; additional batteries on demographics for subsequent disaggregation of results. </li>\n  <li><strong>Target population: </strong>Residents of the country aged 18 or older.</li>\n  <li><strong>Sampling approach: </strong>Data should be collected on the basis of a nationally representative probability sample of the population residing in private households within the country, irrespective of language, nationality or legal residence status. All private households and all persons aged 18 and over within the household are eligible for the question set. The sampling frame as well as methods of sample selection should ensure that every individual and household in the target population is assigned a known probability of selection that is not zero.<em> </em>(integrating the questions for SDG 16.7.2 in a household survey that targets household heads or &#x201C;most informed household member&#x201D; only should be avoided at all costs).</li>\n  <li><strong>Refer to interviewer instructions for additional guidance on terminology: </strong>Interviewers should refer to the specific wording provided below if respondents do not understand certain terms. To ensure consistency in the way this methodology is applied across countries, interviewers should <em>not </em>try to explain the meaning of certain words in their own terms. </li>\n  <li><strong>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t know&#x201D;, &#x201C;refuse to answer&#x201D; or &#x201C;not applicable&#x201D; should not be read out loud to respondents: </strong>Providing a &#x201C;don&#x2019;t know&#x201D; or &#x201C;refuse to answer&#x201D; option provides an easy way for respondents to avoid engaging with the subject of the question. As such, when respondents say they &#x201C;don&#x2019;t know&#x201D;, enumerators should repeat the question and simply ask them to provide their best guess. The &#x201C;don&#x2019;t know&#x201D; and &#x201C;refuse to answer&#x201D; options should be used only as a last resort.<strong> </strong>Interviewers should use<strong> </strong>separate coding for &#x201C;not applicable&#x201D; (NA &#x2013; 97), &#x201C;don&#x2019;t know&#x201D; (DK &#x2013; 98) and &#x201C;not applicable&#x201D; (NA &#x2013; 99), as indicated in the questionnaire. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Questions </strong></p>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong><em>How much would you say the political system in [country X] allows people like you to <u>have a say</u> in what the government does? </em></strong></li>\n  <li><strong><em>Not at all</em></strong></li>\n  <li><strong><em>Very little</em></strong></li>\n  <li><strong><em>Some</em></strong></li>\n  <li><strong><em>A lot</em></strong></li>\n  <li><strong><em>A great deal</em></strong></li>\n  <li><strong><em>Refusal</em></strong></li>\n  <li><strong><em>Don&#x2019;t know</em></strong></li>\n  <li><strong><em>No answer</em></strong></li>\n  <li><strong><em>And how much would you say that the political system in [country] allows people like you to <u>have an influence</u> on politics? </em></strong></li>\n  <li><strong><em>Not at all</em></strong></li>\n  <li><strong><em>Very little</em></strong></li>\n  <li><strong><em>Some</em></strong></li>\n  <li><strong><em>A lot</em></strong></li>\n  <li><strong><em>A great deal</em></strong></li>\n  <li><strong><em>Refusal</em></strong></li>\n  <li><strong><em>Don&#x2019;t know</em></strong></li>\n  <li><strong><em>No answer</em></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><u>Clarifications on question wording</u></p>\n<p><strong><em>&#x201C;The <u>political system</u> in [country]&#x201D;: </em></strong>A particular form of government. For example, democracy is a political system in which citizens govern themselves. Other political systems include republics, monarchies, communist systems and dictatorships.</p>\n<p><strong><em>&#x201C;<u>Having a say</u> in what the government does&#x201D; </em></strong>means having a channel to express one&#x2019;s demands, opinions or preferences about what the government does, and feeling listened to.</p>\n<p><strong><em>&#x201C;<u>Have an influence</u> on politics&#x201D;</em></strong> means feeling that decision-makers listen to and act on one&#x2019;s demands, opinions or preferences. </p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
