It fully complies with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda by distinguishing flows of different nature and concessionality that have different impacts on development, thus creating transparency. It follows the recipient perspective, and all data represent new financing flows to developing countries. It builds on existing work, in particular standard OECD and UNCTAD data collections and the work of the TOSSD Task Force on its measurement of Total Official Support for Sustainable Development (TOSSD).
