			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The indicator is calculated as the total count of conflict-related deaths divided by the total resident population in a given situation of armed conflict for the year, expressed per 100,000 population, occurring within the preceding 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total count of conflict-related deaths includes first the total number of documented direct deaths, using all potentially relevant data sources (e.g. UN peace missions, national statistical offices, national human rights institutions, civil society organisations). Documented cases provide verified information on each direct conflict-related death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the magnitude of conflict-related deaths, capacity of data providers, and other contextual and practical considerations, the methodology will seek to produce statistical estimates of undocumented deaths directly linked to the armed conflict. Further work will be needed to cover deaths indirectly linked to the armed conflict, e.g. loss of access to essential goods and services. Existing data must be updated regularly and retrospectively reflecting the emergence of new data over time.&lt;/p&gt;
