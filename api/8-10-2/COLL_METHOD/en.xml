	<data>&lt;p&gt;In most developing economies, Global Findex data have traditionally been collected through face-to-face&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;interviews. Surveys are conducted face-to-face in economies where telephone coverage represents less than 80 percent of the population or where in-person surveying is the customary methodology. However, during 2021, due to ongoing COVID-19&amp;#x2013;related mobility restrictions, face-to-face interviewing was not possible in some of these economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phone-based surveys were therefore conducted in 67 economies that had been surveyed face-to-face in 2017. These 67 economies were selected for inclusion based on population size, phone penetration rate, COVID-19 infection rates, and the feasibility of executing phone-based methods where Gallup would otherwise conduct face-to-face data collection, while complying with all government-issued guidance throughout the interviewing process. Gallup takes both mobile phone and landline ownership into consideration. According to Gallup World Poll 2019 data, when face-to-face surveys were last carried out in these economies, at least 80 percent of adults in almost all of them reported mobile phone ownership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All samples are probability-based and nationally representative of the resident adult population. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
