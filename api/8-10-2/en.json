The survey was carried out over the 2014 calendar year by Gallup, Inc. as part of its Gallup World Poll, which since 2005 has continually conducted surveys of approximately 1,000 people in each of more than 160 economies and in over 140 languages, using randomly selected, nationally representative samples. The target population is the entire civilian, noninstitutionalized population age 15 and above. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Methodology, including interview procedures, data preparation, margin of error and notes by country are all available at http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/Research/GlobalFindex/PDF/Methodology.pdf </p><p>Data are comparable across countries by design. </p><p>Next collection round: 2017.

Having access to an account is an important starting point for people to access arrange of financial services. </p><p> </p>\n<p>World Bank&#x2019;s Global Findex database is based on individual level surveys worldwide, conducted every three years. The first round of the survey was done in 2011, and the second in 2014. The third round will be done in 2017. The database covers about 140 countries. </p><p>The indicator is based on data collected through individual level surveys in each country with representative samples. Appropriate sampling weights are used in calculating country-level aggregates. </p><ul>\n  <li><strong>At country level </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p> n/a </p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>At regional and global levels </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong> </strong>n/a </p><p>Country level; the percentage of adults owning accounts is multiplied by the number of adults in the country. Then for regional values, sum across all countries in the region is taken and divided by the total adults living in the region. Similarly, for global figures, the same calculation is repeated for all countries. </p><p><strong>Data availability: </strong></p>\n<p>Countries that have at least 1 data point after 2010 for this indicator: </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Asia and Pacific: 35 </p>\n<p>Africa: 38 </p>\n<p>Latin America and the Caribbean: 21 </p>\n<p>Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan: 47 </p>\n<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>\n<p>2011 and 2014.

As financial inclusion is an individual-level concept, this is the appropriate measure. Other surveys that are done at household level may measure the access to finance through another member of the household which may overestimate financial inclusion. </p><p><strong>URL:</strong> </p>\n<p>www.worldbank.org </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong> </p>\n<p>http://www.worldbank.org/globalfindex </p>"}
