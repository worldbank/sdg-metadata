	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percentage of adults (ages 15+) who report having an account (by themselves or together with someone else) at a bank or another type of financial institution or personally using a mobile money service in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concepts:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Account ownership is defined as ownership of an individual or jointly owned account at a regulated institution, such as a bank, credit union, microfinance institution, post office, or mobile money service provider. Data on adults with an account also include an additional 3 percent of respondents who reported having a debit card in their own name; receiving wages, government transfers, a public sector pension, or payments for the sale of agricultural products into a financial institution account or mobile money account in the past 12 months; or paying utility bills from a financial institution account in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial institution refers to banks and other financial institutions in a specific country that offer a transaction account and that fall under prudential regulation by a government body (excluding mobile money accounts). The definition does not include nonbank financial institutions such as pension funds, retirement accounts, insurance companies, or equity holdings such as stocks. Data on adults with a mobile money account only include respondents who personally used a mobile money service to make payments, buy things, or to send or receive money in the past 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
