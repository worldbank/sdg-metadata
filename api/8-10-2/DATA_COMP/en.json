{"status":"success","message":"The DATA_COMP field for indicator 8-10-2, translated into en","data":"<p>The indicator is based on data collected through individual level surveys in each country with representative samples. Data weighting is used to ensure a nationally representative sample for each economy. Final weights consist of the base sampling weight, which corrects for unequal probability of selection based on household size, and the poststratification weight, which corrects for sampling and nonresponse error. Poststratification weights use economy-level population statistics on gender and age and, where reliable data are available, education or socioeconomic status. Regional population weights are used to calculate regional aggregates. </p>\n<p>Full report, including methodology and interview procedures, data preparation, margin of error and notes by country are all available under Methodology Table A.1 here: <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/globalfindex/Report\"></a><a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/globalfindex/Report\">https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/globalfindex/Report</a></p>"}
