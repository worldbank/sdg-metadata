			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;For quality assurance, the Findex team has additional processes in place after it receives the data from Gallup Inc. The Findex team compares the data against (the limited number of) demand-side survey data from external sources for countries whenever available such as from the Financial Inclusion Insights Survey, FinScope, or from Central Banks. The team also consults with key practitioners both within the World Bank and at other key organizations to confirm the credibility of headline numbers on account ownership. &lt;/p&gt;
