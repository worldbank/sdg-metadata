	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 8-10-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt; Global Findex Database&amp;#x2014;only measures the &amp;#x2018;perception&amp;#x2019; people have about their account ownership and usage by providing individual-level survey data on the demographic characteristics of users of financial services. This demand-side data collects information on the percent of adults who think of themselves as &amp;#x2018;banked&amp;#x2019; and having access to an account. The database complements but does replace existing supply-side data and other household surveys.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
