&lt;p&gt;Global Findex is an individual level survey, measuring individual&amp;#x2019;s ownership of accounts. As financial inclusion is an individual-level concept, this is the appropriate measure. Other surveys that are done at household level may measure the access to finance through another member of the household which may overestimate financial inclusion. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
