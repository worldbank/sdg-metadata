	<data>&lt;p&gt;The indicators in the &lt;s&gt;2021 &lt;/s&gt;Global&lt;u&gt; Findex Database 2021&lt;/u&gt;&lt;s&gt; Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) database&lt;/s&gt; are drawn from survey data covering almost 128,000 people in 123 economies&amp;#x2014;representing 91 percent of the world&amp;#x2019;s population. The survey was carried out over the 2021 calendar year&lt;u&gt;, and now marks the fourth round of Global Findex data since 2011. Typically, the survey captures data from more than 140 economies, but surveying was postponed in a handful of countries in 2021 due to COVID-19. These countries were surveyed in 2022, and data on these additional 17 countries will be available in 2023. &lt;/u&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;The surveying is undertaken&lt;/u&gt; by Gallup, Inc. as part of its Gallup World Poll&lt;u&gt;, &lt;/u&gt;&lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt; which since 2005 has continually conducted surveys of approximately 1,000 people in each of more than 160 economies and in over 150 languages, using randomly selected, nationally representative samples. The target population is the entire civilian, noninstitutionalized population age 15 and above. &lt;s&gt;Data on additional 17 countries will be available in 2023. &lt;/s&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full report, including methodology and interview procedures, data preparation, margin of error and notes by country are all available under Methodology Table A.1 here:&lt;/p&gt;
