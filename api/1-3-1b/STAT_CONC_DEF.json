Programs are aggregated into social insurance, social assistance, and labor market according to ASPIRE (Atlas of Social Protection &#x2013; Indicators of Resilience and Equity) classification. Indicators for all social protection and labor programs (SPL) are generated by aggregating the social assistance, social insurance and labor market figures, taking into account program overlaps. </p>\n<p>ASPIRE is the World Bank&apos;s premier compilation of indicators to analyze the scope and performance of social protection programs. Developed by the <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/socialprotection\">Social Protection and Jobs (SPJ) Global Practice</a>, ASPIRE provides indicators for 125 countries on social assistance, social insurance and labor market programs based on both program-level administrative data and national household survey data. ASPIRE is an ongoing project that aims to improve SPL data quality, comparability and availability to better inform SPL policies and programs.</p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
