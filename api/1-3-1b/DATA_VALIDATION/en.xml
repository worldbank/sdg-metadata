	<message>The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 1-3-1b, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;ASPIRE uses nationally representative household survey data from NSOs to estimate SPL performance indicators. NSOs follow their own validation processes to ensure quality. The ASPIRE team relies on these data and on the validation and harmonization processes done by the World Bank&amp;#x2019;s Poverty and Equity practice when data is used from their repositories (mainly for welfare aggregates). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, results on coverage of SPL programs, as well as other performance indicators, are validated by the ASPIRE team through trend comparison, outlier analysis, and consultations with World Bank&amp;#x2019;s Task Team Leaders, specialist and country counterparts. Indicators are validated and cleared by the NSOs when required by these institutions before publication. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
