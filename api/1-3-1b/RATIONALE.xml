			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;ASPIRE coverage indicators refer to the &amp;#x2018;effective&amp;#x2019; coverage definition, measuring the direct and indirect beneficiaries who are receiving social protection benefits at the time when nationally representative household survey data are collected. Coverage of SPL programs is estimated for the total population and for different population groups (income/consumption quintiles, urban and rural populations, and poor and non poor defined by the relative and international poverty lines. &amp;#x2018;Effective&amp;#x2019; coverage is directly relevant to SDG 1 of ending poverty in all its forms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASPIRE indicators do not include individuals who have benefits guaranteed but are not receiving them at the time when the survey is administered &amp;#x2013; for example people who actively contribute to old age pensions and are entitled to the benefits when reaching retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;
