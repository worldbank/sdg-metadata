			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Data are calculated from national representative household surveys using ASPIRE: The Atlas of Social Protection - Indicators of Resilience and Equity, The World Bank (see datatopics.worldbank.org/aspire/). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coverage = Number of beneficiaries in the total population (or group) / Total population (or group). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, ASPIRE indicators are based on a first level analysis of original household survey data (with no imputations) and a unified methodology that does not necessarily reflect country-specific knowledge or in depth country analysis relying on different data sources (administrative program level data).&lt;/p&gt;
