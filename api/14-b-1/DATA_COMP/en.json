or &#x2018;no&#x2019; response and any &#x2018;blank&#x2019; or &#x2018;unknown&#x2019; responses are scored as a &#x2018;no&#x2019;, or zero. A response of yes results in a score that corresponds with the full weighting value for that variable category. For example, a &#x2018;yes&#x2019; response for variables 1.3, 2.1 and 3.1 are scored as 0.1, 0.03 and 0.3 respectively.</p>\n<p>One exception is made in the case of sub-variable 1.5. This question allows a response of &#x2018;other&#x2019; with an associated text field. A positive response in this field is only scored as a &#x2018;yes&#x2019; in the case where the text field is also completed AND at least one of the other prior sub-variable were scored as &#x2018;no&#x2019;. This allows the indicator weighting to remain consistent in all cases.</p>\n<p>Once the specific score has been determined for each country, countries will be classified into a number of bands, ranging from a low to a high degree of implementation, and thus effectively translate a synthetic score into a tangible and intuitive metric for countries.</p>"}
