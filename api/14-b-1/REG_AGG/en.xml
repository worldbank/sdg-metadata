	<message>The REG_AGG field for indicator 14-b-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The categorization into the respective bands will also apply in the case of regional and global aggregates for this indicator. Once the mean score for an SDG region has been calculated, the region will be classified into a particular band reflecting the degree of implementation of relevant instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is combined for the respective nations within a region, as a count of the number of countries by Band, and this can be further aggregated to the global level without the need for any weighting of national or regional scores.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
