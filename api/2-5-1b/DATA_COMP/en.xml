	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 2-5-1b, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;For the animal component the indicator is calculated as the number of local breeds and transboundary breeds with enough genetic material stored within genebank collections allowing to reconstitute the breed in case of extinction (based on the Guidelines on Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources, FAO, 2012, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm&lt;/a&gt;). Numbers for local and transboundary breeds are presented separately. To decide whether the material stored is sufficient on regional or global levels the numbers provided to DAD-IS for each type of material (e.g. semen samples, embryos, somatic cells) conserved within the framework of a cryconservation programme, as well as the number of the respective male and female donor animals, must be summed across the countries belonging to the respective region of interest.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
