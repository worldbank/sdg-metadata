			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;For the Basel and Stockholm Conventions the Electronic Reporting System is the tool to be used by Parties to submit their national reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For guidelines please see the responses for the question 4(h).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reporting format for the Minamata Convention on Mercury has been adopted by the first Conference of the Parties for the submission of national reports pursuant to Article 21. The Secretariat drafted guidance for the short reports (4 questions) to assist Parties. At its second meeting, the Conference of the Parties requested the Secretariat to draft guidance on how to fill out the full reporting format (48 questions), which is under preparation. An online reporting tool has been prepared by the Secretariat to assist Parties and facilitate collecting the information for the reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Montreal Protocol, the responsibility for quality assurance of the submitted data and information lies with the parties. &lt;/p&gt;
