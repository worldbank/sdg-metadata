	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 12-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The transmission of information as required by the five Conventions follows a different timing. This is the reason why the reporting to this indicator has been scheduled for 5-year cycles, which would allow capturing the compliance of Parties with the transmission of information of all the Conventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please also note that the timing for submission of reporting for the Minamata Convention has not yet been agreed on. It is not clear whether any reporting will be required prior to 2020, nor it is clear how many times reporting would be required prior to 2030. Thus, the Minamata Convention is included here, but the reporting is subject to further decisions on this.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
