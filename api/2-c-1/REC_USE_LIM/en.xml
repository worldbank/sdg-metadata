	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 2-c-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;It is appropriate to caution the reader that the indicator is just a guide to understanding market dynamics. As such, one cannot rely on it as the sole element to determine whether a food price in a particular market at a given time is abnormally high or low due to the direct effects of local policies. Results must be weighed with other available information on market fundamentals, macroeconomic context and external shocks. The main challenge in implementing the indicator is data availability and data quality. The calculation of the indicator requires an uninterrupted monthly price series (i.e. if more than 3 consecutive months of data are missing the series may be dropped) of at least 5 years, which include the year being analysed and the 4 preceding years to generate averages and standard deviations. Finally, the indicator is calculated on real price terms to net out the effects of inflation and compare prices in constant money terms over time. However, if food items&amp;#x2019; contribution to CPI is high, it induces downward bias in food real price &amp;#x2013; i.e., it underestimates the extent of the price increase (nominal prices or a non-food CPI could be used).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
