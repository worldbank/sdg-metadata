{"status":"success","message":"The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 2-c-1, translated into en","data":"<p>FAO relies on the Food Price Indices as reported in FAOSTAT as well as on available official domestic food price data that it compiles in the Food Price Monitoring and Analysis (FPMA) tool to calculate the indicator. The FPMA database brings together price series for main food commodities (mainly cereal products) in selected markets in countries around the world. As a result, the indicator estimated by FAO can differ from the indicator estimated at country level, as it may be calculated on prices for a different market or commodity. When food products that are most relevant to the country differ from the five commodities that FAO calculates, countries are strongly encouraged to produce the IFPA of those food items and monitor their price volatilities. </p>"}
