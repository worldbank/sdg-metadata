&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reports of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reports of the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Country Baselines Under the ILO Declaration Annual Review;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Representations under Article 24 of the ILO Constitution;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Complaints under Article 26 of the ILO Constitution;&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Report on the Committee on Freedom of Association. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For non-ratifying countries, the method also codes relevant national legislation with the goal to offset information asymmetries between ratifying and non-ratifying countries as regards FACB rights in law. Ratifying countries are defined as those that have ratified both Conventions 87 and 98, in which case its national legislation is not coded at present. Non-ratifying countries, on the other hand, fall into two categories, those that have ratified neither 87 nor 98 and those that have ratified only one of these Conventions. If a country has ratified only 87, its national legislation is coded for violations pertaining to 98, as violations under 87 fall under the remit of the ILO&amp;#x2019;s Committee of Experts as well as Committee on the Application of Standards. Similarly, if a country has ratified only 98, its national legislation is coded for violations pertaining to 87. Note that for federal states, only federal-level legislation is coded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coding of national legislation is carried out in close collaboration with the International Labour Office to assure that it is done in a manner consistent with the ILO&amp;#x2019;s supervisory system. In addition, countries may also make available information on national legislation when reporting on this indicator through Voluntary National Reports or national reporting platforms or any other national reports. &lt;/p&gt;
