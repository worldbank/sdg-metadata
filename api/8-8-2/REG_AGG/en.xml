	<message>The REG_AGG field for indicator 8-8-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The regional and global aggregates are weighted averages (with weights derived from ILO labour force estimates). To avoid biased estimations, regional aggregates include both countries that have and have not ratified ILO Convention Nos. 87 and 98. For non-ratifying countries, the scores are calculated based on the methodology adopted by the 2018 International Conference of Labour Statisticians (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---stat/documents/meetingdocument/wcms_648636.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---stat/documents/meetingdocument/wcms_648636.pdf&lt;/a&gt;) and are used only for estimation of aggregate scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A country&amp;#x2019;s weight is the share of its labour force in the global labour force for a given time period, where the labour force is derived from the latest edition of the ILO modelled estimates (for further information on the estimates, please refer to the ILO modelled estimates methodological description, available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/ilo-modelled-estimates/&quot;&gt;https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/ilo-modelled-estimates/&lt;/a&gt;). Regional averages, however, are only provided for regions where the proportion of the labour force of countries that have ratified ILO Convention nos. 87 and 98 to the total labour force is greater or equal to 25%, or, where the difference in absolute value between the regional aggregate including all countries and the regional aggregate including only countries that have ratified the ILO conventions is smaller or equal than 2.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
