It is based on six International Labour Organization (ILO) supervisory body textual sources and also on national legislation. National law is not enacted for the purpose of generating a statistical indicator of compliance with fundamental rights, nor were any of the ILO textual sources created for this purpose. Indicator 8.8.2 is compiled from these sources and its use does not constitute a waiver of the respective ILO Constituents&#x2019; divergent points of view on the sources&#x2019; conclusions.&#x201D;<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[2]</a></sup> </p>\n<p>To highlight the difference between ratifying and non-ratifying countries, the following additional clarification is provided:</p>\n<p>&#x201C;SDG indicator 8.8.2 is not intended as a tool to compare compliance among ILO member States. It should specifically be noted that reporting obligations of an ILO member State to the ILO&#x2019;s supervisory system and thus ILO textual sources are different for ratifying and non&#x2010;ratifying ILO member States.&#x201D;<sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-ref-4\">[3]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Based on the decisions adopted by the tripartite technical committee set up to further address refinements to the methodology<sup><a href=\"#footnote-5\" id=\"footnote-ref-5\">[4]</a></sup>, for countries where the score should be treated with care due to the possibility of insufficient information in the textual sources, the following note will be added:</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The score should be treated with care due to the possibility of insufficient information in the textual sources, based on comparison with an externally produced indicator (see Metadata, point 4.f.).&#x201D;<sup><a href=\"#footnote-6\" id=\"footnote-ref-6\">[5]</a></sup></p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-3\">2</sup><p> Idem.
