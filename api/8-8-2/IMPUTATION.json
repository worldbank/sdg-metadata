The indicator will be reported for countries where, based on comparison with an externally produced indicator, the score should be treated with care due to the possibility of insufficient information in the textual sources. For these countries, based on the decisions adopted by the tripartite technical committee set up to further address refinements to the methodology, the indicator will be reported with the following note: &#x201C;The score should be treated with care due to the possibility of insufficient information in the textual sources, based on comparison with an externally produced indicator (see Metadata, point 4.f.).&#x201D;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>At regional and global levels</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the computation of the regional aggregates, treatment of missing values (i.e. scores that are recommended to be dropped) is based on the following rules: (1). If scores are missing for all years, the country is dropped from the sample; (2). If scores are available for a single year, the available score is used for all other years; (3). If scores are available for multiple but not all years, the missing value is computed as the average of available scores.</p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
