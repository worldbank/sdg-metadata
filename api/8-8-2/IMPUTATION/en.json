{"status":"success","message":"The IMPUTATION field for indicator 8-8-2, translated into en","data":"<ul>\n  <li>At country level</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is no treatment of missing values at country level. The indicator is not reported for non-ratifying countries, nor for countries for which ILO supervisory body textual sources do not provide sufficient amount of information in a specific year. The ILO will consult its constituents regarding which countries should be dropped from reporting for these reasons. Until then, the Office proposes continuing with the comparison with an externally-produced indicator to provide the starting point for the ILO Department of Statistics to consult internal and external sources and the tripartite constituents.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>At regional and global levels</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the computation of the regional aggregates, treatment of missing values (i.e. scores that are recommended to be dropped) is based on the following rules: 1. If scores are missing for all years, the country is dropped from the sample; 2. If scores are available for a single year, the available score is used for all other years; 3. If scores are available for multiple but not all years, the missing value is computed as the average of available scores.</p>"}
