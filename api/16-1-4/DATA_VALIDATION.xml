			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The data for the indicator is collected through household surveys conducted by National Statistics Offices (NSOs) or other institutions following tight survey protocols and complying with the metadata. Data producers are encouraged to strictly follow the data quality practices, protocols and frameworks in relation of data quality. In addition to the data, countries are requested to report on the metadata which serves as one additional layer of validation and verification of the data. For survey-based indicators, metadata are assessed in relation to the representativeness and coverage of the survey as well as alignment of question wording and answer options with international standards. Before publication by custodian agencies, a standardised &amp;#x201C;pre-publication process&amp;#x201D; is implemented, where national stakeholders can verify and review the data before publication. &lt;/p&gt;
