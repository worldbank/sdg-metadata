			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The data for the indicator is collected through household surveys conducted by National Statistics Offices (NSOs) or other institutions following tight survey protocols and complying with the metadata. Data producers are encouraged to strictly follow the data quality practices, protocols and frameworks in relation of data quality. In addition to the data, countries are requested to report on the metadata which serves as one additional layer of validation and verification of the data by confronting with the metadata used and the recommended for global reporting. Before publication by custodian agencies, a standardised &amp;#x201C;pre-publication process&amp;#x201D; is implemented, where national stakeholders can verify and review the data before publication. &lt;/p&gt;
