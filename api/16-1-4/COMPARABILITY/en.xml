	<data>&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) only compiles data from national sources, therefore no differences between nationally produced estimates and international estimates should exist. If data from more than one survey are available for the same country, discrepancies may arise due to different wording of the questions, different structure of the questionnaire, different survey methods and operations, different sample design and sample size. As a rule, data from national surveys complying with recommended international standards are used, when available.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
