{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 16-1-4, translated into en","data":"<p>Victimization surveys (as dedicated surveys or as modules of household surveys) are usually restricted to the general population living in households above a certain age (typically 15 or 18 years of age), while sometimes an upper age limit is also applied (typically 65, 70 or 75 years of age).</p>\n<p>There are several limitations associated with the wording of the survey question used to measure fear of crime (&#x2018;How safe do you feel walking alone in your area/neighbourhood after dark?&#x2019;). First, the question assumes that respondents do the following: (1) go out, (2) go out alone, (3) go out in their neighbourhood, and (4) go out after dark. For many respondents, the reasons for not going out alone in their neighbourhood after dark may have nothing or little to do with crime and more to do with personal and circumstantial issues, such as lack of mobility, childcare commitments, or the use of a car that allows them to travel further afield. Second, the question does not define the meaning of &#x201C;neighbourhood&#x201D;, which may mean different things to different respondents, even those living in the same street. Third, the question does not explicitly refer to &#x2018;crime&#x2019;, but rather it is implicit in the question. There may be other reasons unrelated to crime (e.g. wild animals, traffic, etc.) why respondents may not feel safe walking around their neighbourhood after dark.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-8\" id=\"footnote-ref-8\">[7]</a></sup></p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-8\">7</sup><p> UNODC-UNECE (2010) Manual on Victimization Surveys, p. 57. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-8\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>"}
