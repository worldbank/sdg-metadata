			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;At the international level, data are routinely collected by UNODC through the annual UN Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (UN-CTS) data collection. As requested by the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, over 140 Member States have appointed a UN-CTS national focal point that submits UN-CTS data to UNODC. In most cases these focal points are national institutions responsible for data production in the area of crime and criminal justice (National Statistical Offices, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Justice, etc.). For countries that have not appointed a focal point, the request for data is sent to permanent missions in Vienna. When a country does not report to UNODC, other official sources such as authoritative websites, publications, or other forms of communication are used. Once consolidated, data are shared with countries to check their accuracy and validity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN-CTS provides specific definitions of data to be collected. It also collects a set of metadata to identify possible discrepancies from standard definitions and to assess overall data quality (e.g. sample size, target population, agency responsible for the data collection, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
