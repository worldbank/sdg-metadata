It affects the way in which human beings interact with their surroundings, their health, and consequently, their quality of life. Indicator 16.1.4 taps into the concept of &#x2018;fear of crime&#x2019;, which has been elicited in dozens of crime victimization surveys, and the standard formulation used here has been shown to be applicable in different cultural contexts.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-7\" id=\"footnote-ref-7\">[6]</a></sup> It is important to note that fear of crime is a phenomenon that is separate from the prevalence of crime and that fear of crime may be even largely independent from actual experience. The perception of crime and the resulting fear of it is influenced by several factors, such as the awareness of crime, the public discussion, the media discourse, and personal circumstances. Nevertheless, fear of crime is an important indicator in itself as high levels of fear can negatively influence well-being and lead to reduced contacts with the public, reduced trust and engagement in the community, and thus represent an obstacle to development. Fear of crime also differs across demographic groups and this indicator helps to identify vulnerable groups.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-7\">6</sup><p> UNODC-UNECE (2010) Manual on Victimization Surveys, p. 56. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-7\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>"}
