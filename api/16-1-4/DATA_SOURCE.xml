			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Data are collected through official nationally representative surveys. In most cases, such surveys are conducted by National Statistical Offices (NSOs). In some cases, other national institutions or other entities may conduct such surveys according to the same methodological standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data are sent to UNODC by Member States, usually through national UN Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (UN-CTS) Focal Points, which in most cases are national institutions responsible for data production in the area of crime and criminal justice (National Statistical Offices, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Justice, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
