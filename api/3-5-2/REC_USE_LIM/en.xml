	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 3-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The indicator is feasible and suitable for monitoring purposes as evidenced by availability of data from 190 countries and inclusion of this indicator in global, regional and national monitoring frameworks. This is the key indicator for alcohol exposure in populations. The data available (based on production, import, export, and sales or taxation) do not enable the disaggregation of alcohol per capita consumption (APC) by sex or age; to this end, other data sources, such as survey data, are needed. The estimation of unrecorded APC remains a challenge, and triangulation of data from different sources as well as Delphi-techniques are used for increasing validity of estimates. In recent time, the number of research activities focused on improvement of the estimates of unrecorded alcohol consumption as well as their geographical coverage have increased substantially. As a result, it leads to a more accurate assessment of the total amount of alcohol consumed per person per year in a given country. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
