	<message>The REG_AGG field for indicator 7-1-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Regional and global estimates are population-weighted; within a region, the country values are multiplied by the corresponding country populations to obtain weighted fuel values. These values are then summed and divided by the sum of the population of the countries included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low- and middle-income countries with no data were excluded from regional and global aggregations, and values of 100% clean fuel and technology use were used for High income countries for regional and global calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
