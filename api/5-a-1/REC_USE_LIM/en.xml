	<data>&lt;p&gt;If a country adopts the strategy of interviewing one randomly selected person per household, this may result in a small sample size. Countries are recommended to take into consideration the impact on the expected sample size on the precision of the estimates and the tabulation plan. If necessary, countries may consider to interview more than one individual per household, or all individuals. Alternatively, countries may consider to collect information on all household member through a proxy respondent (option 1 above). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is critical that the list of legally binging documents proposed above is customized in order to consider only documents that are enforceable before the law and that guarantee individual&amp;#x2019;s tenure rights in the national context. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
