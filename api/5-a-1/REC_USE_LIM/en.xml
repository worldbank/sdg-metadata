	<data>&lt;p&gt;One recommendation is for countries to take into consideration the impact of the expected sample size on the precision of the estimates. One way of attaining a large enough sample size is to consider collecting information on all eligible respondents through a proxy respondent, as this can be relatively easily done using the household rosters in the surveys. However, it is important to keep in mind that when a proxy respondent provides the information for the member of the household, it is likely that some bias or response errors are introduced &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is critical that the list of legally binding documents of ownership proposed to be included in questions relating to proxy 1 in this document are customized to consider only documents that are enforceable before the law and that guarantee individual&amp;#x2019;s rights in the national context. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
