Thus, the data required to estimate the indicator can be collected through agricultural surveys/ censuses or national household-based surveys having a suitable coverage of agricultural households. </p>\n<p><strong>Agricultural Survey</strong>: Agricultural surveys are a recommended data source for two main reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>The unit of analysis is the agricultural holding, and, in most countries, a one-to-one relationship exists between the household-sector agricultural holding and the agricultural household. Therefore, agricultural surveys capture well the reference population of indicator 5.a.1 </li>\n  <li>Agricultural surveys can easily accommodate questions on agricultural land ownership and tenure rights since they frequently collect data regarding rights to agricultural land and data on agricultural production.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>National household survey (NHS):</strong><sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-12\" id=\"footnote-ref-12\">[11]</a></sup></sup> National household surveys are a recommended data source for indicator 5.a.1 for several reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>National household surveys are the most common data source available in both developed and developing countries.</li>\n  <li>National household surveys tend to be very broad in scope and they are normally used to generate social, demographic and economic statistics. Therefore they: i) can accommodate questions needed for the computation of indicator 5a1; ii) allow exploring associations between the individual status on indicator 5a1 and other individual or household characteristics, such as education, health, income level, etc; iii) can include additional data for a more detailed analysis of the indicator (e.g., land size).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>However, if an NHS is used to collect data to generate estimates for indicator 5.a.1, it is necessary to have a representative sample of agricultural households in the full sample. In addition, especially in countries where a low proportion of households is engaged in agricultural production, a pre-screening and oversampling may be needed, especially in urban and peri-urban areas. </p>\n<p><strong>Agricultural Census: </strong>In the absence of agricultural or household-based surveys, agricultural censuses can be used for collecting data on SDG 5.a.1. However, the Census presents some disadvantages: </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>The Census is usually conducted every 10 years; therefore, it cannot provide data to closely monitor the progress on indicator 5.a.1.</li>\n  <li>Data collection focuses on the structure of the population.</li>\n  <li>It heavily relies on proxy respondents, an approach which is less preferred option to self-responding recommended for indicator 5.a.1 (see below). </li>\n</ol>\n<p><u>Data collection methods</u></p>\n<p>In collecting data for indicator 5.a.1 through an agricultural survey, household survey or agriculture census, two decisions need to be made:</p>\n<p>i) Determine the number of adult members of an agricultural household (eligible respondents) on whom information is to be collected, and </p>\n<p>ii) Determine who should report this information</p>\n<p>Possible options are shown in Table 1 below:</p>\n<p>Table 1.

Thus, among the possible options, Option 1 and Option 2 are recommended:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Option 1</strong>: <em>Self-respondent approach applied to all members. </em>Each adult member of the household is interviewed on their ownership / tenure rights over agricultural land. </li>\n  <li><strong>Option 2</strong>: <em>Self-respondent approach applied to a random sample of adult members of the household. </em>Randomly selected adult household members are interviewed on their ownership / tenure rights over agricultural land. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>In practice, due to budget constraints and interview time limitations, interviewing only n = 1 eligible respondent per household is the most viable option. However, if a country wants to study intra-household dynamics or to increase the precision of the 5a1 estimates, it may decide to collect information about two or more and even all adult household members. </p>\n<p><u>Minimum Set of Data</u></p>\n<p>The minimum set of data needed to calculate the indicator is summarized in Table 2 below:</p>\n<p>Table 2.

Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) can be also used as data collection vehicle, provided that their individual questionnaires are administered to individuals beyond the age classes typically used in these surveys. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-12\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-13\">12</sup><p> Findings from the pilot studies reveal that data from proxy respondents yield different estimates than self-reported data, with variations by asset, by type of ownership and by the sex of the owner. In particular, it was found that proxy-reported data decrease both women&#x2019;s and men&#x2019;s reported ownership of agricultural land. Such underestimation is greater for men (-15 percentage points) than for women (-10 percentage points),and is less pronounced when we consider documented ownership (-7 percentage points for men and -2 percentage points for women). <a href=\"#footnote-ref-13\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-14\">13</sup><p> A full list of data items, and their rationale can be found in UNSD (2019) <a href=\"#footnote-ref-14\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>"}
