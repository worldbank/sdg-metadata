The advantage of this approach is its applicability to different countries. Indeed, based on the analysis of the seven EDGE pilot countries, these proxies provide the most robust measure of ownership/tenure rights that is comparable across countries. In fact, individuals may still have the right to sell or bequeath an asset in the absence of legally recognized document, therefore the indicator combines documented ownership / tenure rights with the right to sell or bequeath to render it comparable across countries.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Operationalization of indicator 5.a.1 expressed through mathematical formulas</u></strong></p>\n<p><u>Sub-indicator 5.a.1 (a) </u></p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Total agricultural population with:</p>\n        <p>Legally recognized document of ownership of agricultural land OR the right to sell it OR the right to bequeath it</p>\n      </td>\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">\n        <p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n            <mo>&#xD7;</mo>\n          </math> 100, by sex</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Total agricultural population</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p><u>Sub-indicator 5.a.1 (b)</u></p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Number of women in the agricultural population with:</p>\n        <p>Legally recognized document of ownership of agricultural land OR the right to sell it OR the right to bequeath it</p>\n      </td>\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">\n        <p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n            <mo>&#xD7;</mo>\n          </math> 100, by type of tenure</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Number of people in the agricultural population with:</p>\n        <p>Legally recognized document on agricultural land OR the right to sell it OR the right to bequeath it</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Use of Sampling Weights</strong></p>\n<p>When the data source is a sample survey, the appropriate survey sampling weights&#x2014;base weights, non-response adjustments and poststratification adjustments&#x2014;should be used in estimating the sub-indicators.
