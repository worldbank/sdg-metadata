Information was extracted for author name, year, age, gender, marker, laboratory test used, number of individuals tested, prevalence of each marker when reported, the population group (general population, HCWs, or blood donors) and whether the data reported was for a city, sub-national (an area, region, state or province in a country) or national level, GDP per capita. In addition to HBsAg, HBeAg was recorded, as available for individuals when HBsAg was also reported. In order to record information on methodological quality and study bias resulting from non-representativeness, an additional variable was used: samples likely to be representative for the country/area specified were coded as 0 and others, e.g. convenience samples in certain communities or tribes in the country were assigned a 1, supplemented by additional information. The risk of bias/non-representativeness information was applied if the population was neither HCW nor blood donor (see description below).<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[3]</a></sup> In the following, variables extracted from the studies and assumptions made are described in detail:</p>\n<p>1. Author, Date</p>\n<p>2. Year start/end of study conduct: Year of study begin and end was extracted. If this information was not available from the studies, we used the commonly used assumption that the study was conducted two years prior to the year of publication (e.g. author, 2000, year of study conduct: 1998). </p>\n<p>3. Sex: Sex-specific values were extracted. If only an overall (all) estimate was provided, the share of females in the study was specified in the column additional information.</p>\n<p>4. Age start/end: The most specific age-group provided by the data was extracted. If the age-group on which the parameter value was based on was not available, assumptions were made based on the context of the study. Therefore, the following was applied in case of missing information on age-groups in the study population: </p>\n<p> a. If the study was conducted in the general population without further specification and if only one prevalence estimate is provided, the age-group was considered to be 0-85 years. Subsequently, if the beginning and last age-group is missing, the lower value of the youngest age-group is 1 year, the upper value of the oldest age-groups is 85 years. </p>\n<p> b. If the study was conducted among adult populations but no age-range is provided, the age-group is considered to be 17-65 years.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> c. If the study was conducted among pupils but no age-range is provided, the age-group is considered to be 5-15 years. </p>\n<p> d. If the study was conducted among pregnant women but no age-range is provided, the age-group is considered to be 15-49 years (reproductive age). </p>\n<p> e. If the study was conducted among blood donors but no age-range is provided, the age-group is considered to be 17-65 years. </p>\n<p> f. If the study was conducted among army recruits or soldiers but no age-range is provided, the age-group is considered to be 18-45 years. </p>\n<p> g. If the study was conducted among the working population but no age-range is provided, the age-group is considered to be 16-65 years. </p>\n<p> h. HBsAg Prevalence: The most specific prevalence estimate provided by the data was extracted (defined by age-/sex-/year-prevalence). Separate lines for each marker were used in the data extraction file (e.g. one for HBeAg and one line for HBsAg, even if the study group/publication was the same)</p>\n<p>5. HBeAg Prevalence (optional marker): The most specific prevalence estimate (defined by age-/sex-/year-prevalence) of HBeAg among HBsAg-positive individuals was extracted and, if applicable was calculated to reflect prevalence among HBsAg carriers. </p>\n<p>6. anti-HBc Prevalence (optional marker): The most specific prevalence estimate provided by the data was extracted (defined by age-/sex-/year-prevalence).</p>\n<p>7. Laboratory method: Testing immune response markers of HBV infection began in the 1970s by counter-immuno-electrophoresis technique (CIEP). Since then, different detection methods have been developed (RIA, EIA, &#x2026;). The most applied method in prevalence studies is the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Five categories were established to record the method/test used for prevalence detection in the studies: ELI new (ELISA -2, -3, EIA, &#x2026;), EIA old (CMIA, CIEP, RPHA), NAT (qPCR/real-time PCR, nested PCR, multiplex PCR), other (e.g. RIA); Unknown/not specified.</p>\n<p>8. Country: Country names were recorded according to www.who.int and, for additional analysis purpose, were grouped according to the six WHO regions: the African Region, the Region of the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean Region, the European Region, the South East-Asia Region and the Western Pacific Region.</p>\n<p>9. Sample size of individuals blood drawn from; of individuals involved in analyses/bases for parameter estimate: As a quality indicator of the study, we distinguished the effective sample size, i.e. the number of individuals involved in the analysis/on which the parameter estimate is based on, from the number of individuals from which blood was drawn from (separate column) and the initially calculated/planed sample size (separate column). </p>\n<p>10. Population: Although focus was on the general population, two additional groups were included and specified. These include: HCW and blood donor (plus subgroups unspecified, paid, unpaid/voluntary). If in this column &#x201C;population&#x201D; was specified as HCW or blood donor and not as general population, the risk of bias column (following) remains empty.</p>\n<p>11. Level: Information is provided if the study was conducted on a national, sub-national, city level or if the level was not further specified (four categories).</p>\n<p>12. Study Location: This free-text variable specifies the city/area within the country where the included study was conducted. The variables/columns Level and Study Location were additionally included following the WHO Meeting on Impact of Hepatitis B Vaccination at WHO, Geneva, in March 2014.</p>\n<p>Additional data from other sources than the eligible studies:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Year of vaccine introduction in the entire country: data is derived from official reports by WHO Member States and unless otherwise stated, data is reported annually through the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/routine/reporting/en/\">WHO/UNICEF joint reporting process</a>. <a href=\"http://www.who.int/entity/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/data/year_vaccine_introduction.xls?ua=1\">http://www.who.int/entity/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/data/year_vaccine_introduction.xls?ua=1</a></li>\n  <li>Period when the study was conducted: pre- vaccination or post vaccination.

Planned for the last quarter of 2019.</p><h2>Data release:</h2>\n<p>Second quarter of each year</p><h1>Data providers</h1>\n<p>World Health Organization</p><h1>Data compilers</h1>\n<p>World Health Organization</p><h2>Rationale:</h2>\n<p>The purpose is to describe the reduction in chronic hepatitis b infections. Most of the burden of disease from HBV infection comes from infections acquired before the age of 5 years. Therefore, prevention of HBV infection focuses on children under 5 years of age. The United Nations selected the cumulative incidence of chronic HBV infection at 5 years of age as an indicator of the Sustainable Development Goal target for &#x201C;combating hepatitis&#x201D;. This indicator is measured indirectly through the proportion of children 5 years of age who have developed chronic HBV infection (i.e. the proportion that tests positive for a marker of infection called hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]). </p><h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n<p>The main Limitations of the analysis is that despite the thorough and in-depth literature search and access, there are fewer data on post vaccination studies than pre- vaccination studies. The model is largely informed by pre-vaccination studies in adults.</p>\n<p>The quality of studies and data was assessed by reviewing representativeness of sampling. Bias factor is a dichotomous variable.</p>\n<p>Potential important biases included geographical representation of the data points. Also, studies were from many different sources such as blood donors and pregnant women. The former possibly having a lower proportion of Hep B prevalence than the general population as donor questionnaires often exclude individuals with risk factors for blood-borne diseases and the pregnant women possibly having a higher prevalence as were in studies to see the effect of a birth dose of vaccine to prevent vertical transmission. As the proportion of studies and size of studies that were from blood donors was significantly greater than those on pregnant women, we may presume that our estimates of prevalence of pre- vaccination may be on the low side.</p><h1>Methodology</h1>\n<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n<p>The data was modelled using a Bayesian logistic regression looking at the proportion of individuals that tested positive for HBsAg in each study, weighting each study by its size and using a conditional autoregressive (CAR) model accounting for spatial and economic correlations between similar countries. This model uses data from well sampled countries to estimate prevalence in more data poor countries with effects such as sex, age and vaccination status, these are also informed by the geographic and countries GDP proximity to other countries (CAR model). Under the assumption that countries that are close together economically and/or geographically will have more similar prevalence due to similar social structure and health care capabilities. </p>\n<p>The response variable in the model was the prevalence of Hepatitis surface antigen (HBsAg) with the explanatory variables being age (three categories, under 5, juvenile (5-15) and adult (16+), split using the average age of participants in the study), sex (proportion female in the study), study bias (e.g. a high fraction of study participants from indigenous populations), 3 dose vaccine coverage, birth dose of the vaccine and country of study. The coverage of routine 3 dose vaccination and birth dose vaccination in each study was calculated by cross referencing the year of and age of participants in each study with the corresponding WHO-UNICEF vaccine coverage estimates for that country. The WHO-UNICEF estimates are annual data for the country as a whole, and did not contain information on vaccine efficacy which was not used in the analysis as no data on this was obtained. The vaccine efficacy would be implicitly estimated in the analysis as we see vaccination having a variable effect across time and space across the studies. The coverage of routine 3 dose vaccination and birth dose vaccination in each study was calculated by cross referencing the year of and age of participants in each study with the corresponding WHO-UNICEF vaccine coverage estimates for that country. The coverage of routine 3 dose vaccination and birth dose vaccination in each study was calculated by cross referencing the year of and age of participants in each study with the corresponding WHO-UNICEF vaccine coverage estimates for that country. More explicitly, the model uses the ages and timing of the study to calculate the years across which the participants are born, so if the if there was an age group range of 10-15 in a study that was undertaken in 2015, the birth years would be from 2000-2005, we then average the vaccination coverage from the WHO-UNICEF estimates across those 5 years assuming that each age was evenly represented in that age group in the study. The same process was used for the 3 dose and birth dose vaccination. </p>\n<p>The general logistic model equation is described below, </p>\n<p><img

<em>n<sub>i</sub></em> is the number of neighbours for country <em>i</em> and weights <em>w<sub>i</sub></em>, are 1. </p>\n<p>The model was simulated in the Bayesian statistical package WinBUGS, and data manipulation and model initialisation run from R (3.3.1) using R2WinBUGS. The model considers the parameters of age, sex, study bias (e.g. a high fraction of study participants from indigenous populations), vaccine coverage, birth dose of the vaccine and country of study. </p>\n<p>The model uses the CAR-normal function, in WinBUGS, to model the spatial and economic autocorrelation related to neighbouring countries. For each country that had prevalence data, a weighted central position was calculated using the size and location of each study. For those countries with no data, we used the population centroid. In a novel approach, we considered 3 dimensions in the country adjacency matrix; we used the usual geographic dimensions, latitude and longitude and also combined these with the natural log of the country&#x2019;s GDP per capita. This was to measure not only geographic but also the developmental proximity of countries. The adjacency matrix for the geo-economic distance gives a score between each country to every other country. Those countries which are close geographically and economically would have a low score and those further apart either geographically or economically would have a high score/distance. Therefore, those countries that are more alike will have a low score and those countries which are alike would have a high score. </p>\n<p>The way we proportioned the geographic and economic distance to produce the adjacency matrix was then explored, this is because geographic distance may be more or less important than economic similarities. Thus, by creating a number of different adjacency matrices (not definitive) we could select the most suitable matrix that explains reality best. We normalised the geographic and GDP distance and then calculated the distance between these two normalised figures. This creates a smoothed Gaussian surface that is dependent on both spatial proximity and GDP per-capita proximity. We compared ratios of, 1:0, 1:1, 2:1, 1:2 (Geographic:GDP). </p>\n<p>For each different adjacency matrix, we also had to select a neighbourhood distance, i.e. over what distance can a country be effected by another. Thus, we also varied the radius of distance from which to select neighbours for the neighbourhood network, we used the maximum minimum distance, twice the maximum minimum and three times the maximum minimum, thus varying the number of neighbours each country would have. </p>\n<p>Finally, to decide the magnitude of the effect one country has on another in the neighbourhood network we varied the weights of pairs of countries in the adjacency matrix, using either a neutral weighting of 1, so that each neighbour has an equal effect on each other (not dependent on the distance in the network), or decaying weights over distance with 1/distance, and 1/distance2, where the closer the country is the greater the effect it has on another country. The outcome of these 36 different combinations led to minimum DIC (Deviance Information Criterion) being found for a ratio of 1:2 (Geographic:GDP), the neighbourhood networks minimum distance being twice the maximum minimum distance and an even weighting of 1/distance for each adjacent country. </p>\n<p>This model structure produces estimates for all fixed effects and also individual country level risk, this provides information on which are significantly at greater or lower risk to the average risk. </p>\n<p>All parameters were given un-informative priors. Simulations were run with 3 MCMC chains with 50,000 burn in iterations and each parameter estimated from 1000 samples taken from a thinned 250,000 iterations to produce the posterior distribution. Convergence was attained, with r&#x302; values all very close to 1.000. Due to the Bayesian framework and WinBUGS software it was possible to gain estimates for countries where we had no data on prevalence, using their GDP and geographic proximity to inform this estimate. Those countries with the largest number of studies provided the estimates with the tightest confidence intervals and those with few or no data were less well defined, often producing a log normal distributed posterior distribution, giving estimates with long tails. </p>\n<p>Posterior distributions of parameters were inspected for convergence and to check for covariance between parameters. Where necessary parameters were centred and scaled to N (0, 1) to aid parameter convergence and remover covariance. This was done for the sex parameter, which was entered as the proportion of the sample that was female; this was seen to co-vary with the intercept and bias parameters before re-centring and scaling. However, the covariance of routine vaccination and birth dose persisted even after re-centring. This is in part unsurprising as there a few instances where birth dose is administered without the routine vaccination. Here we tried to reduce this interaction of the terms by transforming the birth dose data. We modelled birth dose using only data where the birth dose was greater than 60, 70, 80 &amp; 90% respectively, we also modelled birth dose to the square, thus increasing the effect of high birth doses over smaller doses. Model selection dependent on which one both reduced the covariance between the parameters and returned the lowest DIC score. </p>\n<p>Model validation was conducted using 90% of randomly selected data against the remaining 10%, and by comparing model estimates of prevalence against observed data (Figure 3). Figure 4 shows the average prevalence in each country from all the studies plotted against the models estimate. Figure 5 shows the marginal and joint posterior distributions for the fitted parameters. Table 1 gives the estimated parameter values with associated credible intervals.</p>\n<p>During the validation exercise (in which countries were consulted over their estimates) it was pointed out that China had undertaken three very large-scale population-based serological surveys in order to establish baseline prevalence and progress towards HBV elimination. There were a large number of other surveys from China, that are less representative than these three nationwide surveys. We conducted a sensitivity analysis by restricting the data from China to the three nationally representative surveys. The effect of this change in input data was that the effect of vaccination was more distinct, but the estimated age effects (change in prevalence in children under 5, or juveniles (children 5-15 years)) were no longer significantly different from zero (see Table 2 and Figure 6). The deviance was significantly reduced, suggesting a much better fitting model (Table 2), albeit on a somewhat reduced dataset.</p><h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>All values represent the best estimates for the hepatitis B surface antigen indicator and aim to facilitate comparability across countries and over time. The estimates are not always the same as the official national estimates, because of the use of different methodologies and data sources. Estimates are provided for 194 WHO Member States. The analysis was carried out for the age groups 0-5 years and for the general population. Due to scarcity of data from some countries, the estimates are more robust at global and regional level than at country level, therefore, we suggest countries focus on the 95% Credible Intervals and not only on the reported point estimates.</p>\n<p>A thorough and robust literature review was undertaken to find studies across the 194 WHO Member States and across age groups and vaccination status. We updated the systematic review by Schweitzer et al, 2015 that included a systematic search on articles published between Jan 1, 1965, and Oct 23, 2013. We updated the systematic search to include articles published between Oct 23, 2013, and October 30, 2018 in the databases Embase, PubMed, Global Index Medicus, Popline, and Web of Science. </p>\n<p>For each country that had prevalence data, a weighted central position was calculated using the size and location of each study.

The study selection criteria were similar to (Schweitzer, et al., 2015). Observational studies on chronic HBV infection seroprevalence (HBsAg prevalence), done in the general population or among blood donors, health-care workers (HCWs), and pregnant women were considered for inclusion in this systematic review. Studies were excluded if they were systematic reviews or meta-analyses, surveillance reports, case studies, letters or correspondence, or did not contain HBsAg seroprevalence data. Studies were also excluded if they exclusively reported prevalence estimates for high-risk population groups (e.g., migrants and refugees).

Si l'étude a été menée auprès d'élèves, mais qu'aucune tranche d'âge n'est fournie, la tranche d'âge est considérée comme étant de 5 à 15 ans. </p>\n<p> d. Si l'étude a été menée auprès de femmes enceintes, mais qu'aucune tranche d'âge n'est fournie, la tranche d'âge est considérée comme étant de 15 à 49 ans (âge de la reproduction). </p>\n<p> e. Si l'étude a été menée auprès de donneurs de sang, mais qu'aucune tranche d'âge n'est fournie, le groupe d'âge est considéré comme étant de 17 à 65 ans. </p>\n<p> f. Si l'étude a été menée auprès de recrues ou de soldats de l'armée, mais qu'aucune tranche d'âge n'est fournie, la tranche d'âge est considérée comme étant de 18 à 45 ans. </p>\n<p>g. Si l'étude a été menée auprès de la population active, mais qu'aucune tranche d'âge n'est fournie, le groupe d'âge est considéré comme étant de 16 à 65 ans. </p>\n<p> h. Prévalence de l'AgHBs : L'estimation de la prévalence la plus spécifique fournie par les données a été extraite (définie par la prévalence par âge/sexe/année). Des lignes séparées pour chaque marqueur ont été utilisées dans le fichier d'extraction des données (par exemple, une ligne pour l'HBAge et une ligne pour l'HBAgs, même si le groupe d'étude/la publication était le même) </p>\n<p>5. Prévalence de l'HBAge (marqueur optionnel) : L'estimation la plus spécifique de la prévalence (définie par la prévalence par âge/sexe/année) de l'AgHBe parmi les individus positifs pour l'AgHBs a été extraite et, le cas échéant, a été calculée pour refléter la prévalence parmi les porteurs de l'AgHBs. </p>\n<p>6. Prévalence anti-HBc (marqueur optionnel) : L'estimation de la prévalence la plus spécifique fournie par les données a été extraite (définie par la prévalence par âge/sexe/année). </p>\n<p>7. Méthode de laboratoire : L'analyse des marqueurs de la réponse immunitaire de l'infection par le VHB a commencé dans les années 1970 par la technique de la contre-immuno-électrophorèse (CIEP). Depuis lors, différentes méthodes de détection ont été développées (RIA, EIA, &#x2026;). La méthode la plus appliquée dans les études de prévalence est l'ELISA (dosage immunoenzymatique). Cinq catégories ont été établies pour enregistrer la méthode/le test utilisé pour la détection de la prévalence dans les études : ELI nouveau (ELISA -2, -3, EIA, &#x2026;), EIA ancien (CMIA, CIEP, RPHA), NAT (qPCR/RCP en temps réel, PCR emboîtée, PCR multiplex), autre (par exemple RIA) ; Inconnu/non spécifié. </p>\n<p>8. Pays : Les noms des pays ont été enregistrés selonwww.who.int/fr/home et, à des fins d'analyse supplémentaire, ont été regroupés selon les six régions de l'OMS : la région africaine, la région des Amériques, la région de la Méditerranée orientale, la région européenne, la région de l'Asie du Sud-Est et la région du Pacifique occidental. </p>\n<p>9. Taille de l'échantillon des individus à qui on a prélevé du sang, des individus impliqués dans les analyses/bases d'estimation des paramètres : En tant qu'indicateur de qualité de l'étude, nous avons distingué la taille effective de l'échantillon, c'est-à-dire le nombre d'individus impliqués dans l'analyse/base de l'estimation des paramètres, du nombre d'individus sur lesquels le sang a été prélevé (colonne séparée) et de la taille de l'échantillon initialement calculée/planifiée (colonne séparée). </p>\n<p>10. Population : Bien que l'accent ait été mis sur la population générale, deux groupes supplémentaires ont été inclus et précisés. Il s'agit des travailleurs de la santé et les donneurs de sang (plus des sous-groupes non spécifiés, rémunérés, non rémunérés/volontaires). Si dans cette colonne « la population » était spécifiée comme travailleur de la santé ou donneur de sang et non comme population générale, la colonne du risque de biais (suivante) reste vide. </p>\n<p>11. Niveau : Des informations sont fournies si l'étude a été menée au niveau national, infranational, de la ville ou si le niveau n'a pas été précisé davantage (quatre catégories). </p>\n<p>12. Lieu de l'étude : Cette variable de texte libre indique la ville/la région du pays où l'étude incluse a été menée. Les variables/niveaux de colonnes et le lieu de l'étude ont été ajoutés à la suite de la réunion de l'OMS sur l'impact de la vaccination contre l'hépatite B qui s'est tenue à Genève, en mars 2014.</p>\n<p>Données supplémentaires provenant d'autres sources que les études éligibles : </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Année d'introduction du vaccin dans l'ensemble du pays : Les données sont tirées des rapports officiels des États membres de l'OMS et, sauf indication contraire, les données sont communiquées chaque année dans le cadre du processus de rapport conjoint &#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/routine/reporting/en/\">OMS/UNICEF </a>. <a href=\"http://www.who.int/entity/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/data/year_vaccine_introduction.xls?ua=1\">http://www.who.int/entity/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/data/year_vaccine_introduction.xls?ua=1</a></li>\n  <li>Période de réalisation de l'étude : Avant ou après la vaccination.

Les États membres reçoivent une annexe contenant les estimations spécifiques à leur pays, les enquêtes sérologiques utilisées pour alimenter le modèle mathématique et le résumé de la méthodologie. Ils disposent de suffisamment de temps pour fournir toute étude supplémentaire à examiner en fonction des critères d'inclusion et de sélection. </p><h1>Calendrier</h1>\n<h2>Collecte de données :</h2>\n<p>L'examen systématique des enquêtes sérologiques publiées et des estimations de modèles est mis à jour chaque année. Prochaine révision est prévue pour le dernier trimestre de 2019.</p><h2>Publication des données :</h2>\n<p> Deuxième trimestre de chaque année</p><h1>Fournisseurs de données</h1>\n<p>Organisation mondiale de la santé </p><h1>Compilateurs de données </h1>\n<p>Organisation mondiale de la santé </p><h2>Justification :</h2>\n<p>L'objectif est de décrire la réduction des infections chroniques par l'hépatite B. La majeure partie de la charge de morbidité liée à l'infection par le VHB provient d'infections acquises avant l'âge de 5 ans. C'est pourquoi la prévention de l'infection par le VHB se concentre sur les enfants de moins de 5 ans. Les Nations Unies ont choisi l'incidence cumulative de l'infection chronique par le VHB à l'âge de 5 ans comme indicateur de la cible de l'objectif de développement durable pour la « lutte contre l'hépatite ». Cet indicateur est mesuré indirectement par la proportion d'enfants de 5 ans qui ont développé une infection chronique par le VHB (c'est-à-dire la proportion qui est positive pour un marqueur d'infection appelé antigène de surface de l'hépatite B [HBsAg]). </p><h2>Commentaires et limites : </h2>\n<p>Les principales limites de l'analyse sont que, malgré un examen exhaustif de la littérature, il existe moins de données sur les études post-vaccinales que sur les études pré-vaccinales. Le modèle s'inspire largement des études pré-vaccination chez les adultes.</p>\n<p>La qualité des études et des données a été évaluée en examinant la représentativité de l'échantillonnage. Le facteur de biais est une variable dichotomique. </p>\n<p>Parmi les biais potentiels importants, on peut citer la représentation géographique des points de données. En outre, les études provenaient de nombreuses sources disparates, comme les donneurs de sang et les femmes enceintes. Les questionnaires destinés aux donneurs excluent souvent les personnes présentant des facteurs de risque pour les maladies transmissible par le sang et les femmes enceintes peuvent présenter une prévalence plus élevée que celle de la population générale, comme le montrent les études visant à déterminer l'effet d'une dose de vaccin à la naissance pour prévenir la transmission verticale. Étant donné que la proportion des études et la taille des études réalisées avec des donneurs de sang étaient nettement plus importantes que celles réalisées avec des femmes enceintes, nous pouvons supposer que nos estimations de la prévalence de la pré-vaccination sont peut-être faibles.</p><h1>Méthodologie</h1>\n<h2>Méthode de calcul :</h2>\n<p>Les données ont été modélisées à l'aide d'une régression logistique bayésienne examinant la proportion d'individus testés positifs pour l'HBsAg dans chaque étude, en pondérant chaque étude par sa taille et en utilisant un modèle autorégressif conditionnel (CAR) tenant compte des corrélations spatiales et économiques entre des pays similaires. Ce modèle utilise des données provenant de pays bien échantillonnés pour estimer la prévalence dans des pays pauvres en données, avec des effets tels que le sexe, l'âge et le statut vaccinal, qui sont également informés par la proximité géographique et le PIB des pays par rapport aux autres pays (modèle CAR). En partant de l'hypothèse que les pays qui sont proches économiquement et/ou géographiquement, auront une prévalence plus similaire en raison de leur structure sociale et de leurs capacités en matière de soins de santé. </p>\n<p>La variable de réponse dans le modèle était la prévalence de l'antigène de surface de l'hépatite (HBsAg), les variables explicatives étant l'âge (trois catégories, moins de 5 ans, jeunes (5 à 15 ans) et adultes (16 et +), réparties en fonction de l'âge moyen des participants à l'étude), le sexe (proportion de femmes dans l'étude), le biais de l'étude (par exemple, une forte proportion de participants à l'étude issus de populations indigènes), la couverture vaccinale de 3 doses, la dose de naissance du vaccin et le pays de l'étude. La couverture de la vaccination de routine en 3 doses et de la vaccination à la naissance dans chaque étude, a été calculée en croisant l'année et l'âge des participants à chaque étude avec les estimations correspondantes de la couverture vaccinale de l'Organisation mondiale de la Santé (OMS) et de le Fonds des Nations Unies pour l'enfance (UNICEF) pour ce pays. Les estimations OMS-UNICEF sont des données annuelles pour l'ensemble du pays et ne contiennent pas de l'informations sur l'efficacité du vaccin qui n'ont pas été utilisées dans l'analyse, car aucune donnée n'a été obtenue à ce sujet. L'efficacité du vaccin serait implicitement estimée dans l'analyse, car nous constatons que la vaccination a un effet variable dans le temps et dans l'espace selon les études. La couverture de la vaccination de routine à 3 doses et de la vaccination à la naissance dans chaque étude a été calculée en croisant l'année et l'âge des participants à chaque étude avec les estimations correspondantes de la couverture vaccinale de l'OMS et de l'UNICEF pour ce pays. La couverture de la vaccination systématique par trois doses et de la vaccination à la naissance dans chaque étude a été calculée en croisant l'année et l'âge des participants à chaque étude avec les estimations correspondantes de la couverture vaccinale OMS-UNICEF pour ce pays. Plus explicitement, le modèle utilise l'âge et le moment de l'étude pour calculer les années de naissance des participants. Ainsi, s'il y avait une tranche d'âge de 10 à 15 ans dans une étude entreprise en 2015, les années de naissance seraient de 2000 à 2005, nous faisons alors la moyenne de la couverture vaccinale des estimations OMS-UNICEF sur ces 5 années en supposant que chaque âge est représenté de manière égale dans cette tranche d'âge dans l'étude. Le même processus a été utilisé pour la vaccination à 3 doses et la vaccination à la naissance. </p>\n<p>L'équation générale du modèle logistique est décrite ci-dessous, </p>\n<p><img src=\"data :image/png ;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAeEAAABRCAMAAADSKe79AAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAK1UExURf////T09NTU1Nzc3Pz8/O/v79DQ0Pr6+qampnh4eHR0dMLCwpGRkXp6em1tbc/Pz+Li4snJydfX11NTU4KCgt3d3erq6m9vb6Wlpby8vFZWVr6+vvHx8X19fZ+fn3Fxcf7+/uzs7K+vr+7u7l1dXZSUlP39/WdnZ9PT01VVVaenp4yMjJaWlre3t1RUVIiIiLCwsKKiouTk5J2dnWNjY+Pj4+vr6/j4+PX19YaGhoSEhPf399/f3/Dw8Pv7+4uLi2JiYl9fX6CgoNbW1pKSkpWVla2traysrHd3d66urvb29o+Pj0pKSktLS+jo6NXV1fn5+bGxsYODg2xsbGRkZOfn59jY2GlpaYmJicjIyGZmZmFhYY2NjZmZmXZ2duDg4Lm5uc3NzbKysk9PT25ubp6entHR0cDAwPPz81tbW1dXV6GhoWtra3BwcO3t7enp6YGBgbi4uJOTk7W1tVFRUXl5eX9/f+bm5tvb27+/v7Ozs7S0tM7Ozn5+ft7e3tra2uHh4cXFxfLy8nJycnV1daOjo5CQkJubm46OjsPDw8bGxk5OTqioqJeXl3x8fFJSUlBQUMzMzKqqql5eXlhYWMHBwWpqamBgYMrKyoWFhU1NTbq6utnZ2ampqZqamkxMTFxcXOXl5cvLy3Nzc4qKimVlZVlZWba2toCAgLu7u729vaSkpNLS0qurq5iYmIeHh8fHx1paWmhoaHt7e5ycnMTExLGtrfayso9ubvze3ptUVGhnZ/vc3MllZXFvb/3y8vivr/739//+/vvX17VXV3Vqav3r69pdXWtMTP/8/NiAgJhcXOfk5P79/fi6uvixse3q6v78/LN3d6g+PvGSkoBTU8u+vp5AQOy3t/rIyPWYmOLU1JKRkYBXV/WGhui0tJ6dncXExHRjY+GEhPWQkMGysgAAAH/C7rcA\n<p>Where &#x3B2;j sont les effets fixes des variables explicatives <em>x<sub>ii</sub></em>.

Le modèle prend en compte les paramètres de l'âge, du sexe, du biais de l'étude (par exemple, une forte proportion de participants à l'étude issus de populations indigènes), de la couverture vaccinale, de la dose de naissance du vaccin et du pays d'étude. </p>\n<p>Le modèle utilise la fonction CAR-normale, dans WinBUGS, pour modéliser l'autocorrélation spatiale et économique liée aux pays voisins. Pour chaque pays disposant de données de prévalence, une position centrale pondérée a été calculée en utilisant la taille et la localisation de chaque étude. Pour les pays ne disposant pas de données, nous avons utilisé le centroïde de la population. Dans une nouvelle approche, nous avons pris en compte trois dimensions dans la matrice de contiguïté des pays ; nous avons utilisé les dimensions géographiques habituelles, la latitude et la longitude, et les avons également combinées avec le logarithme naturel du PIB par habitant du pays. Il s'agissait de mesurer non seulement la proximité géographique, mais aussi la proximité de développement des pays. La matrice de proximité pour la distance géo-économique donne un score entre chaque pays et chaque autre pays. Les pays qui sont proches géographiquement et économiquement ont un score faible et ceux qui sont plus éloignés géographiquement ou économiquement ont un score/distance élevé. Par conséquent, les pays qui se ressemblent le plus auront un score faible et les pays qui se ressemblent un score élevé. </p>\n<p>La façon dont nous avons proportionné la distance géographique et économique pour produire la matrice de contiguïté a ensuite été explorée, car la distance géographique peut être plus ou moins importante que les similitudes économiques. Ainsi, en créant un certain nombre de matrices de contiguïté différentes (non définitives), nous avons pu sélectionner la matrice la plus appropriée qui explique le mieux la réalité. Nous avons normalisé la distance géographique et la distance du PIB, puis nous avons calculé la distance entre ces deux chiffres normalisés. Cela crée une surface gaussienne lissée qui dépend à la fois de la proximité spatiale et de la proximité du PIB par habitant. Nous avons comparé les ratios de, 1:0, 1:1, 2:1, 1:2 (Géographique:PIB). </p>\n<p>Pour chaque matrice de proximité différente, nous avons également dû sélectionner une distance de voisinage, c'est-à-dire sur quelle distance un pays peut être affecté par un autre. Ainsi, nous avons également fait varier le rayon de la distance à partir de laquelle sélectionner les voisins pour le réseau de voisinage, nous avons utilisé la distance minimale maximale, deux fois la distance minimale maximale et trois fois la distance minimale maximale, faisant ainsi varier le nombre de voisins que chaque pays aurait. </p>\n<p>Enfin, pour décider de l'ampleur de l'effet d'un pays sur un autre dans le réseau de voisinage, nous avons fait varier les poids des paires de pays dans la matrice de contiguïté, en utilisant soit un poids neutre de 1, de sorte que chaque voisin a un effet égal sur l'autre (ne dépendant pas de la distance dans le réseau), soit des poids décroissants sur la distance avec 1/distance, et 1/distance2, où plus le pays est proche, plus l'effet qu'il a sur un autre pays est important. Le résultat de ces 36 combinaisons différentes a permis de trouver un DIC (Deviance Information Criterion) minimum pour un rapport de 1:2 (Géographie:PIB), la distance minimum des réseaux de voisinage étant le double de la distance minimum maximum et une pondération égale de 1/distance pour chaque pays adjacent. </p>\n<p>Cette structure de modèle produit des estimations pour tous les effets fixes et aussi pour le risque au niveau de chaque pays, ce qui fournit des informations sur ceux qui sont significativement plus ou moins exposés au risque moyen. </p>\n<p>Tous les paramètres ont été donnés des antécédents non informatifs. Des simulations ont été effectuées avec 3 chaînes MCMC avec 50 000 brûlures en itérations et chaque paramètre a été estimé à partir de 1000 échantillons prélevés sur 250 000 itérations diluées pour produire la distribution postérieure. La convergence a été atteinte, avec r&#x302 ; des valeurs toutes très proches de 1.000. Grâce au cadre bayésien et au logiciel WinBUGS, il a été possible d'obtenir des estimations pour les pays où nous ne disposions pas de données sur la prévalence, en utilisant leur PIB et leur proximité géographique pour étayer cette estimation. Les pays ayant réalisé le plus grand nombre d'études ont fourni les estimations avec les intervalles de confiance les plus étroits et ceux qui n'avaient que peu ou pas de données étaient moins bien définis, produisant souvent une distribution postérieure log-normale, donnant des estimations avec de longues queues. </p>\n<p>Les distributions postérieures des paramètres ont été inspectées pour vérifier la convergence et la covariance entre les paramètres. Le cas échéant, les paramètres ont été centrés et mis à l'échelle N (0, 1) pour faciliter la convergence des paramètres et la covariance de la suppression. Cela a été fait pour le paramètre du sexe, qui a été saisi comme la proportion de l'échantillon qui était féminine ; on a constaté qu'il variait avec les paramètres d'interception et de biais avant de recentrer et de mettre à l'échelle. Cependant, la covariance de la vaccination de routine et de la dose à la naissance a persisté même après le recadrage. Cela n'est pas surprenant car il y a eu quelques cas où la dose à la naissance a été administrée sans la vaccination de routine. Nous avons essayé ici de réduire cette interaction des termes en transformant les données relatives à la dose de naissance. Nous avons modélisé la dose de naissance en utilisant uniquement les données où la dose de naissance était supérieure à 60, 70, 80 &amp ; 90% respectivement, nous avons également modélisé la dose de naissance au carré, augmentant ainsi l'effet des doses de naissance élevées par rapport aux doses plus faibles. Le choix du modèle dépendait de celui qui réduisait la covariance entre les paramètres et donnait le score CIVD le plus bas. </p>\n<p>La validation du modèle a été réalisée en utilisant 90 % des données sélectionnées au hasard par rapport aux 10 % restants, et en comparant les estimations de la prévalence du modèle aux données observées (figure 3). La figure 4 montre la prévalence moyenne dans chaque pays à partir de toutes les études tracées par rapport à l'estimation du modèle. La figure 5 montre les distributions marginales et articulaires postérieures pour les paramètres ajustés. Le tableau 1 donne les valeurs estimées des paramètres avec les intervalles crédibles associés.\n<p>Au cours de l'exercice de validation (dans lequel les pays ont été consultés sur leurs estimations), il a été souligné que la Chine avait entrepris trois enquêtes sérologiques à très grande échelle dans la population afin d'établir la prévalence de base et les progrès vers l'élimination du VHB. Il y avait un grand nombre d'autres enquêtes en Chine, qui sont moins représentatives que ces trois enquêtes nationales. Nous avons effectué une analyse de sensibilité en limitant les données de la Chine aux trois enquêtes représentatives au niveau national. Cette modification des données d'entrée a eu pour effet de rendre l'effet de la vaccination plus distinct, mais les effets estimés sur l'âge (changement de la prévalence chez les enfants de moins de 5 ans, ou les jeunes (enfants de 5 à 15 ans)) n'étaient plus significativement différents de zéro (voir tableau 2 et figure 6). L'écart a été réduit de manière significative, ce qui suggère un modèle beaucoup plus adapté (tableau 2), bien que sur un ensemble de données quelque peu réduit.</p><h2>Traitement des valeurs manquantes : </h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>Au niveau national : </em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Toutes les valeurs représentent les meilleures estimations de l'indicateur de l'antigène de surface de l'hépatite B et visent à faciliter la comparabilité entre les pays et dans le temps. Les estimations ne sont pas toujours les mêmes que les estimations nationales officielles, en raison de l'utilisation de méthodologies et de sources de données différentes. Des estimations sont fournies pour 194 États membres de l'OMS. L'analyse a été effectuée pour les groupes d'âge de 0 à 5 ans et pour la population générale. En raison de la rareté des données de certains pays, les estimations sont plus robustes au niveau mondial et régional qu'au niveau des pays, c'est pourquoi nous suggérons aux pays de se concentrer sur les intervalles crédibles de 95% et pas seulement sur les estimations ponctuelles rapportées. </p>\n<p>Une analyse documentaire approfondie et solide a été entreprise pour trouver des études sur les 194 États membres de l'OMS, les différents groupes d'âge et le statut de la vaccination.

Извлеченная информация содержала имя автора, год, возраст, пол, маркер, использовавшийся лабораторный тест, количество протестированных лиц, распространенность каждого маркера во время представления отчета, группу населения (общая совокупность населения, медработники или доноры крови) и относились ли представленные данные к городской среде, субнациональному уровню (область, регион, штат или провинция в стране) или национальному уровню, величину ВВП на душу населения. Помимо HBsAg, был зарегистрирован HBeAg при наличии его у лиц, несмотря на то, что HBsAg также был представлен в отчете. Для отражения информации о методологическом качестве и систематической ошибке исследования, вызванной не репрезентативностью, использовалась дополнительная переменная: образцы, которые могут быть репрезентативными для указанной страны / региона, были закодированы как 0 и другие значения, например, удобным образцам в определенных общинах или племенах в стране было присвоено значение 1, снабженное дополнительной информацией. Информация о риске смещения / не репрезентативности применялась, если генеральная совокупность не состояла из медработников или доноров крови (см. описание ниже). <sup> <a href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[ 3]</a></sup>Далее подробно описаны переменные, полученные в ходе исследований, а также сделанные предположения:\n<p>1. Автор, дата </p>\n<p> 2. Год начала / окончания исследования: была определена информация о годах начала и окончания исследования. Если эту информацию невозможно было получить из материалов исследований, мы использовали обычно используемое в таких случаях предположение, что исследование проводилось за два года до времени опубликования материалов (например, фамилия автора, публикация 2000 года, значит исследование было проведено в 1998 году). </p>\n<p> 3. Пол: были получены значения в разбивке по полам. Если была предоставлена только общая (для обоих полов) оценка, доля женщин в исследовании указывалась в столбце «Дополнительная информация». </p>\n<p> 4. Границы начала / конца возрастной группы: была определена конкретная возрастная группа, указанная в информации об исследований. Если информация о возрастной группе, по которой определялось значение параметра, не была доступна, были сделаны предположения, основываясь на контексте исследования. Таким образом, в случае отсутствия информации о возрастных группах исследуемого населении, применялось следующее:</p>\n<p>a. Если исследование проводилось в общей совокупности населения без дальнейшей детализации и была предоставлена только одна оценка распространенности, возрастной группой считалась группа от 0 до 85 лет. Впоследствии, если отсутствовали начальная и конечная границы возрастной группы, нижнее значение самой молодой возрастной группы принималось равным 1 году, а верхнее значение самой старшей возрастной группы составляло 85 лет.</p>\n<p>b. Если исследование проводилось среди взрослого населения, но возрастной диапазон не был указан, возрастной группой считались лица в возрасте 17–65 лет. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> c. Если исследование проводилось среди учеников, но возрастной диапазон не был указан, возрастной группой считались лица в возрасте 5-15 лет. </p>\n<p> d. Если исследование проводилось среди беременных женщин, но возрастной диапазон не был указан, возрастной группой считались лица в возрасте 15-49 лет (репродуктивный возраст). </p>\n<p> e. Если исследование проводилось среди доноров крови, но возрастной диапазон не был указан, возрастной группой считались лица в возрасте 17–65 лет. </p>\n<p> f. Если исследование проводилось среди призывников или солдат, но возрастной диапазон не был указан, возрастной группой считались лица в возрасте 18-45 лет. </p>\n<p> g. Если исследование проводилось среди работающего населения, но возрастной диапазон не указан, возрастной группой считались лица в возрасте 16-65 лет. </p>\n<p> h. Распространенность HBsAg: была отобрана наиболее характерная оценка распространенности, полученная на основе данных (определенная по возрасту / полу / году - распространенности). Отдельные строки для каждого маркера использовались в файле отбора данных (например, одна строка для HBeAg и одна строка для HBsAg, даже если у исследовательской группы / в публикации была одна и та же).</p>\n<p> 5. Распространенность HBeAg (дополнительный маркер): была отобрана наиболее характерная оценка распространенности HBeAg (определенная по возрасту / полу / году-распространенности) среди лиц с положительным анализом на HBsAg и, в случае необходимости, рассчитана для отображения распространенности среди носителей HBsAg.</p>\n<p> 6. Распространенность aнти-HBc (дополнительный маркер): была отобрана наиболее характерная оценка распространенности, полученная на основе данных (определенная по возрасту / полу / году-распространенности ).</p>\n<p> 7. Лабораторный метод: тестирование маркеров иммунной реакции на инфекцию HBV началось в 1970-х годах с помощью метода противоиммуноэлектрофореза (ПИЭФ). С тех пор были разработаны различные методы обнаружения (RIA, EIA, и т.д.). Наиболее часто применяемый метод в исследованиях распространенности - ИФА (иммуноферментный анализ). Для обозначения метода / теста, использованного для определения распространенности при проведении исследований, было установлено пять категорий: новый ELI (ELISA -2, -3, EIA, и т д.), старый EIA (хемилюминесцентный иммуноанализ - CMIA, противоиммуноэлектрофорез - ПИЭФ, пассивная гемагглютинация - RPHA), тест на нуклеиновые кислоты - NAT (qPCR / полимеразная цепная реакция (ПЦР) в реальном времени, вложенная ПЦР, мультиплексная ПЦР), другие (например, радиоиммуноанализ RIA); Неизвестно / не указано.\n</p>\n<p>8. Страна: названия стран были приведены в соответствии с материалами сайта www.who.int и, для целей дополнительного анализа, сгруппированы по шести регионам ВОЗ: Африканский регион, регион Америк, регион Восточного Средиземноморья, Европейский регион, регион Юго-Восточной Азии и регион Западной части Тихого океана. </p>\n<p> 9. Объем выборки лиц, у которых была взята кровь; лиц, включенных в анализы / базы для оценки параметров: В качестве показателя качества исследования мы определили оптимальный объем выборки, то есть количество лиц, включенных в анализы / на которых основывается оценка параметра, количества лиц, у которых была взята кровь (отдельный столбец), и первоначально рассчитанный / запланированный объем выборки (отдельный столбец).</p>\n<p>10.Население: Хотя основное внимание уделялось общей совокупности населения, были включены и определены две дополнительные группы. К ним относятся: медработники и доноры крови (плюс неопределенные подгруппы, оплачиваемые, неоплачиваемые / добровольные). Если в этом столбце \"население\" были обозначены медработники или доноры крови, а не общая совокупность населения, столбец риска систематической ошибки (следующий) остается пустым.</p>\n<p> 11. Уровень: Информация предоставляется, если исследование проводилось на национальном, субнациональном, городском уровне или если уровень никак не был определен (четыре категории).</p>\n<p> 12. Место проведения исследования: эта переменная в виде произвольного текста определяет город / район в стране, где проводилось данное исследование.

Им предоставляется достаточно времени для проведения любого дополнительного исследования, материалы которого должны быть проверены на соответствие критериям включения и исключения. </p><h1> Календарь </h1>\n<h2> Сбор данных: </h2>\n<p> Систематический обзор опубликованных серологических обследований и модельных оценок обновляется ежегодно.

Большая часть бремени заболеваний ВГВ-инфекцией происходит от инфекций, приобретенных в возрасте до 5 лет. Таким образом, профилактика инфекции ВГВ сосредоточена на детях младше 5 лет. Организация Объединенных Наций выбрала совокупную заболеваемость хронической инфекцией ВГВ в возрасте 5 лет в качестве показателя Цели в области устойчивого развития «Борьба с гепатитом». Этот показатель косвенно отображается посредством доли детей в возрасте 5 лет, у которых развилась хроническая инфекция ВГВ (т.е. доля детей с положительным результатом теста на маркер инфекции, называемый поверхностным антигеном гепатита B [HBsAg]). </p><h2> Комментарии и ограничения: </h2>\n<p>Основные ограничения анализа заключаются в том, что, несмотря на тщательный и углубленный поиск и доступ к литературе, имеется меньше данных о поствакцинальных исследованиях, чем об исследованиях, проводимых до вакцинации. Модель в значительной степени основана на исследованиях взрослых до вакцинации . </p>\n<p> Качество исследований и данных оценивалось путем анализа репрезентативности выборки. Фактор смещения - это дихотомическая переменная. </p>\n<p>Возможные важные ошибки включали географическое представление элементов данных. Кроме того, результаты исследования получались из разных источников, таких как доноры крови и беременные женщины. В первой группе, возможно имеющей более низкий уровень распространенности гепатита B, чем в общей совокупности населения, поскольку при анкетировании доноров часто исключаются лица с факторами риска заболеваний, передающихся через кровь, и беременные женщины, возможно, имеющие более высокий уровень распространенности, как это было обнаружено при исследованиях, проведенных для того, чтобы увидеть эффект от дозы вакцины, вводимой ребёнку при рождении для предотвращения наследственной передачи. Поскольку доля и объем исследований, проведенных с участием доноров крови, были значительно больше, чем с беременными женщинами, мы можем предположить, что наши оценки распространенности, рассчитанные до вакцинации, могут быть заниженными.</p><h1>Методология</h1>\n<h2>Метод расчета:</h2>\n<p>Данные были смоделированы с использованием Байесовской логистической регрессии, в которой учитывалась доля лиц, имевших положительный тест на HBsAg в каждом исследовании, взвешивая каждое исследование на его размер и используя модели условной авторегрессии (УАР), учитывающей пространственные и экономические корреляции между похожими странами. В этой модели используются данные из правильно отобранных стран для оценки распространенности в большинстве стран с недостаточным количеством данных, включая такие факторы, как пол, возраст и вакцинационный статус, они также основаны на географической близости и близкого значения ВВП страны по сравнению с другим странам (модель УАР). Предположение допускает, что страны, которые находятся на близком расстоянии друг от друга экономически и / или географически, будут иметь более сходную распространенность из-за похожей социальной структуры и близких возможностей системы здравоохранения. </p>\n<p>Зависимой переменной в модели была распространенность поверхностного антигена гепатита (HBsAg) с объясняющими переменными, такими как возраст (состоит из трех категорий: дети младше 5 лет, подростки (5-15) и взрослые (16+), расщепление с использованием среднего возраста участников исследования), пол (доля женщин в исследовании), систематическая ошибка исследования (например, большая доля участников исследования из коренного населения), охват вакцинацией из трех доз, вакцинация детей при рождении и страна проведения исследования. Охват обычной вакцинацией из трех доз и вакцинацией детей при рождении в каждом исследовании рассчитывался путем перекрестного связывания года рождения и возраста участников каждого исследования с соответствующими оценками охвата вакцинацией, произведенными ВОЗ-ЮНИСЕФ для данной страны. Оценки ВОЗ-ЮНИСЕФ представляют собой годовые данные для страны в целом и не содержат информации об эффективности вакцинации, эта информация не использовалась в анализе, поскольку никаких данных по этому поводу получено не было. Эффективность вакцины можно было быть неявно оценить в ходе анализа, поскольку мы видим, что вакцинация оказывает различный эффект в динамике по времени и в пространстве во всех исследованиях. Охват обычной вакцинацией из трех доз и вакцинацией детей при рождении в каждом исследовании рассчитывался путем перекрестного связывания года рождения и возраста участников каждого исследования с соответствующими оценками охвата вакцинацией, произведенными ВОЗ-ЮНИСЕФ для данной страны. Охват обычной вакцинацией из трех доз и вакцинацией детей при рождении в каждом исследовании рассчитывался путем перекрестного связывания года рождения и возраста участников каждого исследования с соответствующими оценками охвата вакцинацией,  произведенными ВОЗ-ЮНИСЕФ для данной страны. Более конкретно, в модели используют возраст и расписание проведения исследования для расчета лет, в границах которых участники родились, поэтому, если в исследовании, проведенном в 2015 году, диапазон возрастной группы был от 10 до 15 лет, то годы рождений укладываются в период с 2000 по 2005 годы. Затем усредняем охват вакцинацией по оценкам ВОЗ-ЮНИСЕФ за эти 5 лет, предполагая, что каждый возраст был равномерно представлен в этой возрастной группе в проведенном исследовании. Та же процедура был применена для расчетов по вакцинации из трех доз и вакцинации детей при рождении. </p>\n<p> Общее уравнение логистической модели описано ниже, </p>\n<p><img

<em>n<sub>i</sub></em> количество соседних стран для страны <em>i</em> и веса <em>w<sub>i</sub></em>, являются 1. </p>\n<p>Модель создавалась в Байесовском статистическом пакете WinBUGS, а обработка данных и инициализация модели выполнялись из R (3.3.1) с помощью R2WinBUGS. Модель учитывает такие параметры, как возраст, пол, систематическая ошибка исследования (например, большая доля участников исследования из коренного населения), охват вакцинацией, вакцинацией детей при рождении и страна проведения исследования. </p>\n<p>Модель использует нормальную функцию УАР в WinBUGS для моделирования пространственной и экономической автокорреляции, связанной с соседними странами. Для каждой страны, в которой имелись данные о распространенности, была рассчитана взвешенная центральная позиция с использованием объема и места проведения каждого исследования. Для стран, в которых нет данных, мы использовали центроид населения. В новом подходе мы рассмотрели 3 измерения в матрице смежности страны; мы использовали обычные географические координаты, широту и долготу, а также объединили их с натуральным логарифмом величины ВВП страны на душу населения. Это должно было отразить не только географическую близость стран, но и их близость по уровню развития. Матрица примыканий для геоэкономического расстояния дает оценку между какой-либо одной страной и любой другой страной. Те страны, которые расположены близко друг к другу географически и экономически, будут иметь низкий балл, а страны, расположенные дальше друг от друга географически или экономически, будут иметь высокий балл / расстояние. Следовательно, страны, которые значительно похожи друг на друга, будут иметь низкий балл, а страны, которые просто похожи, будут иметь высокий балл. </p>\n<p>Затем был исследован способ пропорционального распределения географического и экономического расстояния для построения матрицы примыканий, поскольку географическое расстояние может иметь большее или меньшее значение, чем экономическое сходство. Таким образом, создав несколько различных матриц примыканий (не окончательных), мы смогли выбрать наиболее подходящую матрицу, которая лучше всего объясняет реальность. Мы нормализовали географическое расстояние и расстояние, выраженное в объеме ВВП, а затем рассчитали расстояние между этими двумя нормализованными цифрами. Это создает сглаженную Гауссову поверхность, которая зависит как от пространственной близости, так и от близости объемов ВВП на душу населения. Мы сравнили соотношения, 1: 0, 1: 1, 2: 1, 1: 2 (географическое расстояния: ВВП). </p>\n<p> Для каждой отдельной матрицы примыканий мы также должны были выбрать расстояние соседства, то есть на каком расстоянии одна страна может оказывать влияние на другую. Таким образом, мы также изменяли радиус расстояния, с которого можно выбирать соседей для сети соседства, мы использовали максимально минимальное расстояние, вдвое больше максимального минимума и втрое больше максимального минимума, таким образом изменяя количество соседей, которые будет иметь каждая страна.</p>\n<p>Наконец, чтобы определить величину влияния, которое одна страна оказывает на другую в сети соседства, мы изменяли веса пар стран в матрице примыканий, используя либо нейтральный вес, равный 1, чтобы каждый сосед оказывал одинаковое влияние друг на друга (не зависит от расстояния в сети), или уменьшая веса по расстоянию с 1 / расстояние и 1 / расстояние 2, где чем ближе страна, тем большее влияние она оказывает на другую страну. Результат этих 36 различных комбинаций привел к тому, что минимальный КИС (критерий информационного сдвига) был найден для отношения 1: 2 (географическое расстояния: ВВП), минимальное расстояние сетей соседства было в два раза больше максимально минимального расстояния и равным взвешиванием 1 / расстояние для каждой примыкающей страны.</p>\n<p>Эта структура модели дает оценки для всех фиксированных эффектов, а также уровень риска отдельной страны, это дает информацию о том, какие риски значительно выше или ниже среднего риска. </p>\n<p>Всем параметрам была дана неинформативная оценка. Моделирование проводилось с 3 цепями Монте Карло Маркова с 50 000 выжиганиями в итерациях, и каждый параметр оценивался на основе 1000 образцов, взятых из прореженных 250 000 итераций, для получения апостериорного распределения. Достигнута сходимость, все значения r̂ очень близки к 1.000. Благодаря Байесовской структуре и программному обеспечению WinBUGS можно было получить оценки для стран, по которым у нас не было данных о распространенности, используя их ВВП и географическую близость для получения этой оценки. Страны с наибольшим количеством исследований предоставили оценки с наиболее узкими доверительными интервалами, а страны с небольшим количеством данных или без них были менее четко определены, часто давая логарифмически нормальное распределенное апостериорное распределение, дающее оценки с длинными хвостами. </p>\n<p> Апостериорные распределения параметров проверялись на сходимость и ковариацию между параметрами. Где необходимые параметры были центрированы и масштабированы до N (0, 1), чтобы способствовать сходимости параметров и удалению ковариации. Это было сделано для гендерного параметра, который был введен как доля женщин в выборке; Было замечено, что это зависит от параметров пересечения и смещения до повторного центрирования и масштабирования. Однако ковариация обычной вакцинации и вакцинации детей при рождении сохранялась даже после повторного центрирования. Это отчасти неудивительно, поскольку есть несколько случаев, когда вакцинации детей при рождении проводится без обычной вакцинации. Здесь мы попытались уменьшить это взаимодействие терминов путем преобразования данных о вакцинации детей при рождении. Мы смоделировали вакцинацию детей при рождении, используя только данные, где вакцинация детей при рождении была больше 60, 70, 80 и 90% соответственно, мы также смоделировали вакцинацию детей при рождении как квадрат, таким образом увеличивая эффект больших значений вакцинации детей при рождении по сравнению с меньшими значениями. Выбор модели зависит от того, какая из них уменьшила ковариацию между параметрами и вернула самую низкую оценку КИС. </p>\n<p>Проверка модели проводилась с использованием 90% случайно отобранных данных по сравнению с оставшимися 10% и путем сравнения модельных оценок распространенности с наблюдаемыми данными (рис. 3). На рис. 4 показана средняя распространенность в каждой стране из всех исследований, сопоставленная с оценками моделей. На рис. 5 показаны периферийные и совместные апостериорные распределения для подобранных параметров. В таблице 1 приведены оценочные значения параметров с соответствующими доверительными интервалами.</p>\n<p>В ходе проверки (при которой со странами проводились консультации по поводу их оценок) было отмечено, что Китай провел три очень крупномасштабных серологических обследования населения, чтобы установить исходную распространенность и прогресс в направлении ликвидации ВГВ. Было проведено большое количество других обследований в Китае, которые были менее репрезентативными, чем эти три общенациональных обследования. Мы провели анализ чувствительности, ограничив данные из Китая тремя национально репрезентативными обследованиями. Эффект от этого изменения исходных данных заключался в том, что фактор вакцинации был более отчетливым, но оценочные возрастные факторы (изменение распространенности среди детей до 5 лет или подростков (дети 5-15 лет)) больше не отличались значительно от нуля ( см. табл. 2 и рис. 6). Отклонение было значительно уменьшено, что позволило предложить гораздо более подходящую модель (табл. 2), хотя и на несколько сокращенном наборе данных.</p><h2> Обработка отсутствующих значений: </h2>\n<ul>\n  <li> <strong> <em> На страновом уровне: </em> </strong> </li>\n</ul>\n<p> Все значения представляют собой наилучшие оценки показателя поверхностного антигена гепатита В и призваны облегчить сопоставимость между странами и в динамике по времени.

Анализ проводился для возрастных групп 0-5 лет и для общей совокупности населения. Из-за нехватки данных по некоторым странам оценки являются более надежными на глобальном и региональном уровнях, чем на страновом, поэтому мы предлагаем странам сосредоточиться на 95% достоверных интервалах, а не только на представленных точечных оценках. </p>\n<p>Был проведен тщательный и обстоятельный обзор литературы, чтобы найти результаты проведенных исследований в 194 государствах-членах ВОЗ, по разным возрастным группам и прививочном статусе. Мы обновили систематический обзор Швейцера и др., 2015 г., который включал систематический поиск статей, опубликованных с 1 января 1965 года по 23 октября 2013 года. Мы обновили систематический поиск, включив в него статьи, опубликованные с 23 октября 2013 года по 30 октября 2018 года в базах данных Embase, PubMed, Global Index Medicus, Popline и Web of Science.</p>\n<p> Для каждой страны, в которой имелись данные по распространенности, была рассчитана взвешенная центральная позиция с учетом объема и места проведения каждого исследования. Для стран, по которым не имелось данных, мы использовали центроид населения.

Критерии отбора результатов исследований были аналогичны (Schweitzer, et al., 2015). Обсервационные исследования серологической распространенности хронической инфекции ВГВ (распространенность HBsAg), проведенные в общей совокупности населения или среди доноров крови, медицинских работников (МР) и беременных женщин, рассматривались для включения в этот систематический обзор. Исследования исключались, если они представляли собой систематические обзоры или метаанализы, отчеты о наблюдениях, тематические исследования, письма или переписку или не содержали данных о серологической распространенности HBsAg. Исследования также исключались, если в них отражались исключительно оценки распространенности для групп населения с высоким уровнем риска заражения (например, мигрантов и беженцев).
