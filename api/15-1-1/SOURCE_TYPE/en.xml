	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forest area:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on Forest area are collected by FAO through the Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA). This assessment has been carried out at regular intervals since 1946 and are now produced every five year. The latest of these assessments, FRA 2020, contains information for 236 countries and territories on about 60 variables related to the extent of forests, their conditions, uses and values for several points in time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Land area:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on land area are collected from FAO members through the annual FAO Questionnaire on Land Use, Irrigation and Agricultural Practices. Missing data may be sourced from national statistical yearbooks and other official government data portals. Supplemental information for further gap filling may be derived from national and international sectoral studies and reports, as well as from land cover statistical information compiled by FAO and disseminated in FAOSTAT.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
