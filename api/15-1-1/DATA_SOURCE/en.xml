	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forest area:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on forest area are provided by the countries and reported to FAO through a global network of officially nominated national correspondents. For the countries and territories which do not have a national correspondent, a desk study is prepared by FAO using previously reported information, literature search, remote sensing or their combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Land area:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data are provided by the National Focal Points in National Institutions, typically National Statistical Offices, Ministries of Agriculture or other relevant Agencies. Records of National Focal Points is maintained up to date through the questionnaire cover where countries are requested to confirm the focal point contact detail (e.g. Name, Title, Administration and Office, Email and Web site address) as well as through official communications from countries to FAO, or information provided to FAO during meetings, conferences or commissions. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
