	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 15-1-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Forests fulfil a number of functions that are vital for humanity, including the provision of goods (wood and non-wood forest products) and services such as habitats for biodiversity, carbon sequestration, coastal protection and soil and water conservation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator provides a measure of the relative extent of forest in a country. The availability of accurate data on a country&amp;apos;s forest area is a key element for forest policy and planning within the context of sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in forest area reflect the demand for land for other uses and may help identify unsustainable practices in the forestry and agricultural sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forest area as percentage of total land area may be used as a rough proxy for the extent to which the forests in a country are being conserved or restored, but it is only partly a measure for the extent to which they are sustainably managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator was included among the indicators for the Millennium Development Goals (MDG indicator&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7.1 &amp;#x201C;Proportion of land covered by forest&amp;#x201D;).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
