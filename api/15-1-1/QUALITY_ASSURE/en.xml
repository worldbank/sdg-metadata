	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data on forest area reported by countries to FAO are subject to a rigorous review process to ensure correct use of definitions and methodology as well as internal consistency. A comparison is made with past assessments and other existing data sources. Regular contacts between national correspondents and FAO staff by e-mail, through the FRA online platform and during regional/sub-regional review workshops form part of this review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on land area are reported by FAO members through the FAO Land Use, Irrigation and Agricultural Practices questionnaire. Collected data are routinely checked for internal consistency (e.g. outliers and significant variation in time series). Observed discrepancies are routinely checked and validated with countries.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
