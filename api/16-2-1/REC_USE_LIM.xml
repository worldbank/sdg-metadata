			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;In the third and fourth rounds of MICS, the standard indicator referred to the percentage of children&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aged 2-14 years who experienced any form of violent discipline (physical punishment and/or psychological aggression) within the past month. Beginning with the fifth round of MICS (MICS5), the age group covered was expanded to capture children&amp;#x2019;s experiences with disciplinary practices between the ages of 1 and 14 years. Therefore, current data availability does not capture the full age range specified in the SDG indicator since data are not collected for adolescents aged 15-17 years and further methodological work is needed to identify additional items on disciplinary practices relevant for older adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;
