	<data>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data is collected through an online survey based on this metadata sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The survey may include additional questions, such as those on inter-ministerial and/or multi-stakeholder coordination mechanism for SCP.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The questions included in the survey can be revised as needed, in particular as data becomes available through the survey and alignment may be required with related ongoing work under the SDGs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The 10YFP Global Survey on National SCP Policies and Initiatives, administered by the 10YFP Secretariat in 2015, and reported on by 10YFP National Focal Points, as well as the subsequent report, may complement information and data collected. &lt;/li&gt;
