			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Whereas the indicator quantifies and monitors countries&amp;#x2019; progress along the policy cycle of binding and non-binding policy instruments aimed at supporting Sustainable Consumption and Production; it does not provide any qualitative information and whether policies were well-designed or if a proper background analysis had been conducted, the quality of implementation, level of enforcement, and its effects. These aspects will have to be looked at through narrative reports / qualitative analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator encompasses policy instruments supporting the shift to SCP, including: policies which identify SCP as a key priority, policies focused on SCP and sectoral policies with SCP objectives. It is acknowledged that sectoral policies are also being reported under other SDG indicators and in particular 12.7.1 (# of countries implementing sustainable public procurement policies and action plans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establishing baselines and targets can be time and resource intensive and depends on the willingness of 10YFP National Focal Points to communicate necessary information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main aspects regarding precision, reliability, attribution and double counting are addressed above. If you come across additional issues, please inform the 10YFP Secretariat.&lt;/p&gt;
