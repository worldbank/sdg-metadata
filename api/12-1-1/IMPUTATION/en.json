Thus &#x201C;0.0&#x201D; can represent either NA, or a genuine 0.0, or (crucially) a combination of both, which is a common situation. This allows for values to be easily aggregated into further aggregations; however, it should be thus noted that due to imputing missing values as &#x2018;0.0&#x2019;, the aggregations may represent a lower value than actual situation. </p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels:</strong></p>\n<p>Similarly, missing values are imputed as zero in the regional and global aggregations. </p>\n<p>Note: the disaggregation categories above are indicative and some can be left empty when reporting on measures for which such data elements are not available.</p>"}
