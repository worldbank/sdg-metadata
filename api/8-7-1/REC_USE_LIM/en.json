{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 8-7-1, translated into en","data":"<p>While the concept of child labour includes working in activities that are hazardous in nature, to ensure comparability of estimates over time and to minimize data quality issues, work beyond age-specific hourly thresholds are used as a proxy for hazardous work for the purpose of reporting on SDG indicator 8.7.1. Further methodological work is needed to validate questions specifically aimed at identifying children in hazardous working conditions. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Similarly, while the worst forms of child labour other than hazardous also form part of the concept of child labour more broadly, data on the worst forms of child labour are not currently captured in regular household surveys given difficulties with accurately and reliably measuring it. Therefore, this element of child labour is not captured by the indicators used for reporting on SDG 8.7.1. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In addition, &#x2018;own use production of goods&#x2019;, including activities such as fetching water and collecting firewood, falls within the production boundary set by the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA). However, for the purpose of SDG reporting of indicator 8.7.1, and with the goal of facilitating international comparability, fetching water and collecting firewood have been classified as unpaid household services (i.e., household chores), a form of production that lies outside the SNA production boundary. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>More broadly, child labour estimates based on the statistical standards set out in the ICLS resolution represent useful benchmarks for international comparative purposes but are <u>not</u> necessarily consistent with estimates based on national child labour legislation. ILO Convention No. 138 contains a number of flexibility clauses left to the discretion of the competent national authority in consultation (where relevant) with workers&#x2019; and employers&#x2019; organizations (e.g., minimum ages, scope of application).<sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-ref-4\">[3]</a></sup> This means that there is no single legal definition of child labour across countries, and thus, no single statistical measure of child labour consistent with national legislation across countries. </p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-4\">3</sup><p> Principal areas of flexibility in the Convention include: (a)<em>minimum ages</em>: Members whose economy and educational facilities are insufficiently developed may specify a lower general minimum age of 14 years (Art. 2.4) and a lower age range for light work of 12 to 14 years (Art 7.4); and (b) <em>scope of application</em>: Members may exclude from the application of the Convention limited (non-hazardous) categories of employment or work in respect of which special and substantial problems of application arise (Art. 4.1). Members whose economy and administrative facilities are insufficiently developed may also initially limit the scope of application of the Convention (Art. 5.1) beyond a core group of economic activities or undertakings (Art. 5.3). <a href=\"#footnote-ref-4\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>"}
