	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 17-3-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Personal remittances are the sum of two items defined in the sixth edition of the IMF&amp;apos;s Balance of Payments Manual: personal transfers and compensation of employees. World Bank staff estimates on the volume of personal remittances data are used for gap-filling purposes. GDP data, sourced from the World Bank&amp;#x2019;s World Development Indicators (WDI) database, are then used to express the indicator as a percentage of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
