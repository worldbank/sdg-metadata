	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 4-a-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For administrative sources:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNESCO Institute for Statistics produces time series based on data reported by Ministries of Education or National Statistical Offices. The data are gathered through the annual Survey of Formal Education (on access to electricity, drinking water, sanitation and handwashing facilities) and through the Survey on ICTs in Education (on access to electricity, Internet and computers). Data on adapted infrastructure are not collected currently. Countries are asked to report data according to the levels of education defined in the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) to ensure international comparability of resulting indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data received are validated using electronic error detection systems that check for arithmetic errors and inconsistencies and trend analysis for implausible results. Queries are taken up with the country representatives reporting the data so that corrections can be made (of errors) or explanations given (of implausible but correct results). During this process, countries are also encouraged to provide estimates for missing or incomplete data items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, countries also have an opportunity to see and comment on the main indicators the UIS produces in an annual &amp;#x201C;country review&amp;#x201D; of indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For cross-national learning assessments:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is acquired from the administrators of cross-national assessment; typically, these are available for download publicly. UIS analyses this data to provide estimates of the indicator. When there is more than one data point available for a given level of schooling, an average is used as the indicator. Annexe Table 2 presents the questionnaire used to collect data in the cross-national assessments included. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
