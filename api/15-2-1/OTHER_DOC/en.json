The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 meters. </li>\n  <li>Includes areas with young trees that have not yet reached but which are expected to reach a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of 5 meters or more. It also includes areas that are temporarily unstocked due to clear-cutting as part of a forest management practice or natural disasters, and which are expected to be regenerated within 5 years. Local conditions may, in exceptional cases, justify that a longer time frame is used.</li>\n  <li>Includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those of specific environmental, scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest.</li>\n  <li>Includes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectares and width of more than 20 meters.</li>\n  <li>Includes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of trees that have, or are expected to reach, a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of at least 5 meters.</li>\n  <li>Includes areas with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless whether this area is classified as land area or not.</li>\n  <li>Includes rubberwood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations. </li>\n  <li>Includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height and canopy cover criteria are met.</li>\n  <li><u>Excludes</u> tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive orchards and agroforestry systems when crops are grown under tree cover. <u>Note:</u> Some agroforestry systems such as the &#x201C;Taungya&#x201D; system where crops are grown only during the first years of the forest rotation should be classified as forest.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>ABOVE-GROUND BIOMASS</strong></p>\n<p>All living biomass above the soil including stem, stump, branches, bark, seeds, and foliage.</p>\n<p><u>Explanatory note </u></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>In cases where forest understorey is a relatively small component of the aboveground biomass carbon pool, it is acceptable to exclude it, provided this is done in a consistent manner throughout the inventory time series.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>PROTECTED AREAS</strong></p>\n<p>Areas especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources, and managed through legal or other effective means.</p>\n<p><strong>FOREST AREA WITHIN PROTECTED AREAS</strong></p>\n<p>Forest area within formally established protected areas independently of the purpose for which the protected areas were established. </p>\n<p><u>Explanatory notes</u></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Includes IUCN Categories I &#x2013; IV</li>\n  <li><u>Excludes</u> IUCN Categories V-VI</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>FOREST AREA WITH MANAGEMENT PLAN</strong></p>\n<p>Forest area that has a long-term documented management plan, aiming at defined management goals, which is periodically revised. </p>\n<p><u>Explanatory notes</u></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>A forest area with management plan may refer to forest management unit level or aggregated forest management unit level (forest blocks, farms, enterprises, watersheds, municipalities, or wider units).</li>\n  <li>A management plan must include adequate detail on operations planned for individual operational units (stands or compartments) but may also provide general strategies and activities planned to reach management goals.</li>\n  <li>Includes forest area in protected areas with management plan.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED FOREST MANAGEMENT CERTIFICATION</strong></p>\n<p>Forest area certified under a forest management certification scheme with published standards and is independently verified by a third-party.</p>\n<p><strong>Annex 2 &#x2013; Methodology</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sub-indicator 1 - Annual forest area change rate</strong></p>\n<p><u>Unit</u>: Percent</p>\n<p><u>Reference period:</u> 2010-2020</p>\n<p><u>Method of estimation:</u> Compound annual change rate formula as follows:</p>\n<p>r = [(A<sub>t2</sub>/A<sub>t1</sub>)<sup>1/(t2-t1) </sup>&#x2013; 1]*100</p>\n<p>with: </p>\n<p>r = compound annual change rate for the period t<sub>1 - </sub>t<sub>2 </sub></p>\n<p>t<sub>i</sub> = time i (year)</p>\n<p>A<sub>t1 </sub>= forest area at t<sub>1 </sub></p>\n<p>A<sub>t2 </sub>= forest area at t<sub>2</sub></p>\n<p><u>Translation to dashboard/traffic light:</u></p>\n<p>The following flowchart explains the logic behind the translation of this indicator to a dashboard/traffic light:</p>\n<p>Forest area change direction</p>\n<p>Forest area stable </p>\n<p>or increasing</p>\n<p>Forest area decreasing</p>\n<p>Change in forest area loss rate </p>\n<p>Loss rate</p>\n<p>decreasing</p>\n<p>Loss rate stable</p>\n<p>or increasing</p>\n<p>The forest area change direction is determined by examining the value of the forest area change rate for the most recent period, a negative value indicate a loss of forest area, a zero value means that forest area is stable and a positive value means that forest area has increased.
