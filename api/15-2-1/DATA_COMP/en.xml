	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 15-2-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;National data on forest area, biomass stock, forest area within protected areas, and forest area under management plan are reported directly by countries to FAO for pre-established reference years. Based on the country reported data, FAO then makes country-level estimates of the forest area net change rate using the compound interest formula. The proportion of forest area within protected area and under management plan is calculated using the reported areas for each reference year and the forest area for year 2015. Data on forest area under an independently verified forest management certification scheme are reported to FAO by the head offices of respective forest certification scheme, who are jointly adjusting the figures to remove any double accounting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No dashboard traffic lights are made at country level. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
