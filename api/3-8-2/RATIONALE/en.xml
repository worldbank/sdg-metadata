	<data>&lt;p&gt;Target 3.8 is about UHC and is defined as &amp;#x201C;Achieve universal health coverage, including &lt;em&gt;financial risk protection&lt;/em&gt;, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all&amp;#x201D;. The concern is with all people and communities receiving the quality health services they need (including medicines and other health products), without financial hardship. Financial hardship is a key consequence of inadequate of financial risk protection mechanisms and can be experienced in any country, regardless of the income level and type of health system. Indicator 3.8.2 is about identifying people with out-of-pocket health spending on health exceeding their ability to pay, which might lead to cutting spending on other basic needs such as education, food, housing and utilities. Reducing financial hardship in health is important on the global development agenda as well as a priority of the health sector of many countries across all regions.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
