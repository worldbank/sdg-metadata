	<message>The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 3-8-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The microdata obtained by WHO is requested to National Statistical Offices with the denominator (household total consumption expenditure) already constructed following their own guidelines and follows those guidelines when the denominator is not provided. WHO generates the numerator (household total health spending) following the definitions and classifications described in 2.a and 2.c. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microdata obtained by the World Bank is provided by country governments and typically includes the denominator and the numerator already constructed. Sometimes, the World Bank has to construct the welfare aggregate or adjust the aggregate provided by the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microdata obtained by both institutions to track SDG indicator 3.8.2 has typically already been checked for quality to track other important indicators (e.g. SDG indicator 1.1.1). A quality assessment is performed before consulting countries on SDG 3.8.2 estimates (see section 4.k).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimates produced by both organizations are included in a consultation to obtain country&amp;#x2019;s feedback and revised as needed.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
