{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 3-8-2, translated into en","data":"<p>It is feasible to monitor indicator 3.8.2 on a regular basis using the same household survey data that is used to monitor SDG targets 1.1 and 1.2 on poverty<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-7\" id=\"footnote-ref-7\">[6]</a></sup></sup>. These surveys are also regularly conducted for other purposes, such as calculating weights for the Consumer Price Index. These surveys are typically undertaken by National Statistical Offices (NSOs). Thus, monitoring the proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health as a share of total household consumption or income does not add any additional data collection burden so long as the health expenditure component of the household non-food consumption data can be identified. While this is an advantage, indicator 3.8.2 suffers from the same challenges of timeliness, frequency, data quality and comparability of surveys as SDG indicator 1.1.1. However, indicator 3.8.2 has its own conceptual and empirical limitations.</p>\n<p>First, challenges to track out-of-pocket health spending (numerator): indicator 3.8.2 attempts to identify financial hardship that individuals face when using their income, savings or taking loans to pay for health care. However, most household surveys fail to identify the source of funding used by a household that is reporting health expenditure. In countries where there is no retrospective reimbursement of household spending on health, this is not a problem. If a household does report any expenditure on health, it would be because it will not be reimbursed by any third-party payer. It is, therefore, consistent with the definition given for direct health care payments (the numerator). For those countries, on the other hand, where there is retrospective reimbursement &#x2013; for example, via a contributory health insurance scheme - the amount reported by a household on health expenditures might be totally or partially reimbursed at some later point, perhaps outside the recall period of the household survey. </p>\n<p>Clearly, more work is needed to ensure that survey instruments gather information on the sources of funding used by the household to pay for health care or that the household survey instrument always specifies that health expenditures should be net of any reimbursement. The survey instrument and sample design should also be carefully reviewed to minimize measurement errors due to both non-sampling errors such as very short or very long recall periods precluding proper data collection of all health care components (overnight stay, medicines, etc.); or sampling errors such as over-sample of areas with a particularly low burden of disease.</p>\n<p>Second, the sensitivity of the indicator to the choice of the welfare metric for disaggregation (consumption or income in the denominator): in the current definition of indicator 3.8.2, large health expenditures can be identified by comparing how much household spend on health to either household income or total household expenditure. Expenditure is the recommended measure of a household&#x2019;s resources (see concept section), but recent empirical work has demonstrated that while statistics on 3.8.2 at the country level are fairly robust to such choice, their disaggregation by income group is pretty sensitive to it. Income-based measures show a greater concentration of the proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health among the poor than expenditure-based measures (see Chapter 2 in the WHO and World Bank 2017 report on tracking universal health coverage as well as Wagstaff et al. 2018).</p>\n<p>Third, cut-off values to identify large health expenditures: indicator 3.8.2. relies on a single cut-off point to identify what constitutes &#x2018;large health expenditure as a share of total household expenditure or income&#x2019;. People just below such threshold are not taken into account, which is always the problem with measures based on cut-offs. This is simply avoided by plotting the cumulative distribution function of the health expenditure ratio behind 3.8.2. By doing so, it is possible to identify for any threshold the proportion of the population that is devoting any share of its household&#x2019;s budget to health. </p>\n<p>Fourth, there are other indicators used to measure financial hardship, all based on the same data sources. The current definition of SDG indicator 3.8.2 is based on methodologies dating back to the 1990s developed in collaboration with academics at the World Bank and the World Health Organization. It corresponds to an indicator of the incidence of catastrophic health spending using a budget share approach (see references). In addition to SDG indicator 3.8.2, WHO also defines large health expenditure in relation to non-subsistence spending<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-8\" id=\"footnote-ref-8\">[7]</a></sup>,<sup><a href=\"#footnote-9\" id=\"footnote-ref-9\">[8]</a></sup>,<sup><a href=\"#footnote-10\" id=\"footnote-ref-10\">[9]</a></sup>,</sup> and both WHO and the World Bank use indicators of impoverishing health spending to assess to what extent OOP health spending deters efforts to &#x201C;End poverty in all its form everywhere&#x201D; (SDG 1). </p>\n<p>Fifth, SDG indicator 3.8.2. needs to be tracked jointly with SDG indicator 3.8.1, as well as indicators of barriers to access. Two indicators have been chosen to monitor target 3.8 on Universal Health Coverage within the SDG framework. SDG indicator 3.8.1 is for the health service coverage dimension of universal health coverage (UHC), and SDG indicator 3.8.2 tracks the financial protection dimensions. These two indicators should always be monitored jointly. Indeed, some of the people seeking care face barriers to access related to financial constraints, acceptability issues, unavailability of services, or accessibility. Those unable to overcome such barriers (financial and non-financial ones) will not report any spending on health, which will tend to reduce SDG indicator 3.8.2 rates. When this happens, SDG indicator 3.8.1 levels should also be low as the tracer indicators of service coverage should reflect that large fractions of the population are unable to get the services they need. But specific indicators on barriers to access ought to be tracked to understand which type of barriers is precluding access to needed services. </p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-7\">6</sup><p> <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf\">http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf</a> <a href=\"#footnote-ref-7\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-8\">7</sup><p> Chapter 2 in &#x201C;Tracking universal health coverage: 2017 global monitoring report&#x201D;, World Health Organization and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/ The World Bank; 2017; <a href=\"http://www.who.int/healthinfo/indicators/2015/en/\">http://www.who.int/healthinfo/indicators/2015/en/</a> ; <a href=\"#footnote-ref-8\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-9\">8</sup><p>Xu, K., Evans, D.
