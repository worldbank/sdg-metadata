	<data>&lt;p&gt;UNEP-WCMC produces the UN List of Protected Areas every 5&amp;#x2013;10 years, based on information provided by national ministries/agencies. In the intervening period between compilations of UN Lists, UNEP-WCMC works closely with national ministries/agencies and NGOs responsible for the designation and maintenance of protected areas, continually updating the WDPA as new data become available. The WDOECM is also updated on an ongoing basis. The WDKBA is also updated on an ongoing basis with updates currently released twice a year, as new national data are submitted.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
