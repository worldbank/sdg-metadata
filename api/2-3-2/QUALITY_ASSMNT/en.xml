	<message>The QUALITY_ASSMNT field for indicator 2-3-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Qualitative assessment has been performed on the final estimations of the indicator, which was updated this year and compared with 2019 results. PPP conversion factors are retrieved from the World Bank and are constantly updated, which results in a change of conversion factors and therefore a slight modification in the results on indicator 2.3.2. from 2019 to 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some countries have data that needs to be assessed further, either checks on the raw data and/or the processing of data by the RuLIS team.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
