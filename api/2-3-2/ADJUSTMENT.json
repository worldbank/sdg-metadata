For each country and year, the LCU labor value of production has to be converted into PPP 2011 USD. The process first consists on accounting for inflation in the currency, for which the Consumer Price Index (CPI) of each country is used; once deflated, it is converted into PPP 2011 USD, which allows for a homogenous standard of the indicator. SDG 2.3 not only focuses on small-scale farmers, but also on women and people with indigenous status. The indicator (which is at the household level) is then calculated disaggregated by sex, that is, whether the household is female or male headed.</p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
