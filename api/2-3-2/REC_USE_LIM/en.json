{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 2-3-2, translated into en","data":"<p>Given the approved methodology, the computation of the indicator requires survey microdata collected at the farm level on a wide range of variables &#x2013; including all elements allowing to compute revenues and costs of the enterprise together with labour input and the availability of land and livestock &#x2013; referred to the same production unit. Such type of surveys are seldom collected at the national level. For this reason, the availability of data for the indicator is altogether limited. In some countries, data can be obtained from household surveys reporting details on agricultural production. These data sources have to be considered as second-best solution, given that their sampling is focused on households and not on food production units. While in many countries there is a considerable degree of overlap between the population of food producers and households, this is still a partial overlap, which can undermine the accuracy of the computation. </p>"}
