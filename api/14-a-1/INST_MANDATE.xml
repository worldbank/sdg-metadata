			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;IOC-UNESCO is the custodian agency for the SDG indicator 14.a.1. The purpose of the Commission is to promote international cooperation and to coordinate programmes in research, services and capacity-development, in order to learn more about the nature and resources of the ocean and coastal areas and to apply that knowledge for the improvement of management, sustainable development, the protection of the marine environment, and the decision-making processes of its Member States. In addition, IOC is recognized through the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as a competent international organization in the fields of Marine Scientific Research (Part XIII) and Transfer of Marine Technology (Part XIV). According to its Statutes, the Commission may act also as a joint specialized mechanism of the organizations of the United Nations system that have agreed to use the Commission for discharging certain of their responsibilities in the fields of marine sciences and ocean services, and have agreed accordingly to sustain the work of the Commission. IOC&amp;#x2019;s Member States agreed to submit information relevant to the SDG indicator 14.a.1 to the IOC Secretariat in 2014 IOC/EC-XLVII/2 Annex 8. &lt;/p&gt;
