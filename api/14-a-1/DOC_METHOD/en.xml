	<message>The DOC_METHOD field for indicator 14-a-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No particular guidance for the national data compilation exists as the organization of ocean science differs among Member States. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The IOC Secretariat recommends that IOC national focal points (IOC official national designated Coordinating Bodies for Liaison with the IOC) consult with the respective ministry(ies) responsible for ocean science and national universities and institutions to obtain SDG indicator 14.3.1 data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IOC is an intergovernmental body of 150 Member States, the IOC national focal points may act as national coordinating bodies for relevant government departments, universities and research institutions actively involved in marine science and technology and other related aspects of ocean affairs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As mentioned in point 3.a, the novelty of the GOSR published for the first time in 2017, and the respective data collection of the 14.a.1 related data, requires the IOC secretariat to collect the data via its national focal point until now. Future data collections might explore data availability at NSOs. New national reporting mechanisms are being established, which facilitate the provision of the required information (e.g. Colombia, Canada, Italy; document IOC-XXIX/2 Annex 14). The GERD (gross domestic expenditure on research and development) data were obtained from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics/World Bank, based on information directly provided from NSOs.&lt;/li&gt;
