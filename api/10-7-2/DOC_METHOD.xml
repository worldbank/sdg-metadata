  &lt;li&gt;The Inquiry questionnaire includes guidance, definitions and instructions. UN DESA, IOM and OECD are available to respond to country queries and provide further clarifications. In addition, IOM and OECD have identified focal points/country offices available to assist with the implementation of the Inquiry at the country level. To facilitate responses and to accommodate requests for material in different languages, the survey tool was translated into the six official languages of the UN (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No new international recommendations and guidelines are proposed. As noted in the previous paragraphs, the methodology is based on an IOM Council resolution regarding the Migration Governance Framework, and an existing data collection mechanism, the Inquiry, mandated by the UN General Assembly. &lt;/li&gt;
