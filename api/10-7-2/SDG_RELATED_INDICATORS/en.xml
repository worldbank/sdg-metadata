	<message>The SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS field for indicator 10-7-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Indicator 10.7.2 is complementary to several related SDGs indicators. These include, but are not limited to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicator 8.8.1 &amp;#x201C;Frequency rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries, by sex and migrant status&amp;#x201D;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicator 8.8.2. &amp;#x201C;Level of national compliance of labour rights (freedom of association and collective bargaining) based on International Labour Organization (ILO) textual sources and national legislation, by sex and migrant status&amp;#x201D;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicator 10.7.1. &amp;#x201C;Recruitment cost borne by employee as a proportion of yearly income earned in country of destination&amp;#x201D;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicator 10.7.3. &amp;#x201C;Number of people who died or disappeared in the process of migration towards an international destination&amp;#x201D;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicator 10.7.4. &amp;#x201C;Proportion of the population who are refugees, by country of origin&amp;#x201D;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicator 10.c.1 &amp;#x201C;Remittance costs as a proportion of the amount remitted&amp;#x201D;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicator 10.7.2 is also complementary to other national migration monitoring frameworks, including IOM&amp;#x2019;s MGI, which entered its third phase in 2018. The MGI operates as a policy-benchmarking framework and offers insights into policy levers that countries could use to further develop their migration governance. It contains nearly 90 questions related to countries&amp;#x2019; national migration policies, which fall under the same six domains as indicator 10.7.2.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
