Ten countries responded to the pilot: Cote d&apos;Ivoire; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Finland; France; Lesotho; Lithuania; Mexico; Morocco; Sweden and Yemen. Results of the pilot are presented in the addendum &#x201C;Methodology development narrative&#x201D;.</p>\n<p>As of 1 September 2019, 111 Governments had provided data on SDG indicator 10.7.2 through Module III of the Twelfth Inquiry; equivalent to 56 per cent of all countries globally. Coverage of the indicator by SDG region is uneven. In terms of country coverage, four regions (Europe and Northern America, Northern Africa and Western Asia, Oceania and sub-Saharan Africa) had data available for 50 per cent or more of countries. In terms of the population coverage, five regions (Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, Europe and Northern America, Latin America and the Caribbean, Oceania and sub-Saharan Africa) meet the 50 per cent criterion. For Central and Southern Asia, both country coverage and population coverage are below 50 per cent.</p>\n<p><strong>Table 3.
