{"status":"success","message":"The COVERAGE field for indicator 10-7-2, translated into en","data":"<p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>\n<p>Thirty countries were invited to take part in a pilot of the proposed methodology for indicator 10.7.2; six from each of the UN regional commissions. Ten countries responded to the pilot: Cote d&apos;Ivoire; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Finland; France; Lesotho; Lithuania; Mexico; Morocco; Sweden and Yemen. Results of the pilot are presented in the addendum &#x201C;Methodology development narrative&#x201D;.</p>\n<p>As of 31 October 2021, 138 Governments had provided data on SDG indicator 10.7.2 through the international migration module of the Inquiry; equivalent to 70 per cent of all countries globally. Of these, 49 countries responded to the Twelfth Inquiry only, 27 to the Thirteenth Inquiry only and 62 to both the Twelfth Inquiry and the Thirteenth Inquiry. </p>\n<p>Coverage of the indicator by SDG region is uneven. In terms of country coverage, three regions (Europe and Northern America, Northern Africa and Western Asia and sub-Saharan Africa) had data available for 75 per cent or more of countries. Although the coverage was lower for other regions, all regions had data for at least 50 per cent of countries. </p>\n<p><strong>Table 3.
