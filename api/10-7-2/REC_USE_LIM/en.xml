	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 10-7-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Developing a synthetic, robust indicator with the breadth and scope of target 10.7 as formulated in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is challenging. As co-custodians of indicator 10.7.2, UN DESA and IOM recognize that the indicator is neither expected nor designed to be comprehensive (figure 2); hence the importance of other, complementary tools such as IOM&amp;#x2019;s Migration Governance Indicators (MGI) Project.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</data>
