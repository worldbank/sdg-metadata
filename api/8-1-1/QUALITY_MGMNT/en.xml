	<data>&lt;p&gt;All official data received by the United Nations Statistics Division are checked for errors prior to incorporation in the United Nations official data database. The checking involves ensuring that aggregate indicators are equal to the sum of their components and that indicators which are provided in multiple tables are represented consistently. Footnotes are added to the data when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the estimated data are checked for consistency by ensuring that aggregate indicators are equal to the sum of their components and that indicators which are represented in multiple tables are represented consistently. The estimates derived for each year are compared to previous years to ensure that estimates are prepared consistently from year to year. Additionally, the growth rate from year to year is analyzed to identify anomalies in the data.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
