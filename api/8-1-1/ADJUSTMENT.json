When these conversion rates are not available, other IMF rates are used (official rates or principal rates). For countries whose exchange rates are not reported by the IMF, the annual average of United Nations operational rates of exchange (UNOPs) is applied. The UNOPs are conversion rates that are applied in official transactions of the United Nations with these countries. These exchange rates are based on official, commercial and/or tourist rates of exchange. </p>\n<p>In cases where a country experiences considerable distortion in the conversion rates, the UNSD uses price-adjusted rates of exchange (PARE) as an alternative to the exchange rates reported by the IMF or UN operational rates of exchange. The conversion based on PARE corrects the distorting effects of uneven price changes that are not well reflected in the other conversion rates. Consequently, unrealistic levels in GDP and other national accounts aggregates expressed in US Dollars may have been adjusted for certain time periods to improve the economic analysis at national, regional and local levels. </p>\n<p>The constant-price GDP series for each country is then divided by its population to obtain its real GDP per capita. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>More information on the methodology to estimate the data is available on <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/assets/pdf/methodology.pdf\">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/assets/pdf/methodology.pdf</a> </p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
