	<data>&lt;p&gt;Although countries or areas calculate GDP using the common principles and recommendations in the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA), there are still problems in international comparability of GDP estimates. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Different versions of the SNA (for example, 1968, 1993 or 2008) countries or areas use in calculating their GDP estimates.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Different degree of coverage of informal and non-observed economic activities in the GDP estimates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, as a necessary condition to being a key economic performance indicator of sustainable development, one of the often-cited limitations of GDP is that it does not account for the social and environmental costs of production. It is designed as a measure of the level of overall well-being. For example, growth in real GDP per capita reveals nothing concerning energy and material interactions with the environment.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
