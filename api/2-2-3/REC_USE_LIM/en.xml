	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 2-2-3, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Despite the extensive data search, data for blood haemoglobin concentrations are still limited, compared to other nutritional indicators such as child anthropometry (1, 24); this was especially true in the high-income countries of the WHO European Region. As a result, the estimates may not capture the full variation across countries and regions, tending to &amp;#x201C;shrink&amp;#x201D; towards global means when data are sparse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimates may differ from those reported by countries.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
