	<message>The ADJUSTMENT field for indicator 2-2-3, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data on mean haemoglobin and anaemia prevalence from high-altitude countries that were not adjusted for altitude when published were adjusted for altitude by WHO, as described in Stevens et al (2013). The Bayesian hierarchical mixture internally adjusts summary statistics computed with non-standard haemoglobin cut-offs to match the standard WHO cut-offs listed above. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
