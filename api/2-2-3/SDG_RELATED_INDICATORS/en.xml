	<data>&lt;p&gt;Anaemia is estimated to contribute to 17% lower productivity in heavy manual labour and 5% lower productivity in other manual labour (Goal 1 End poverty in all its forms everywhere); during pregnancy, it increases the risk of maternal and perinatal mortality and contributes to low birth-weight infants (Goal 3. Good health and well-being); it also limits cognitive development, children who have adequate iron have more energy to participate in classroom exercises, and they are more mentally prepared to master the material (Goal 4. Quality education); anaemia rates in females are much higher than males &amp;#x2014; while anaemia rates decrease for males by the end of puberty, they remain high for females through reproductive years due to menstruation, thus reducing anaemia contributes to boosting females&amp;#x2019; relative academic performance and worker productivity and helps achieve gender equality (Goal 5. Gender equality).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
