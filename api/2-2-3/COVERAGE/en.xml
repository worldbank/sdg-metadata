	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prevalence of anaemia and/or mean haemoglobin in women of reproductive age were obtained from 408 population-representative data sources from 124 countries worldwide. Data collected from 1995 to 2020 were used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimates for 2000 to 2019 were derived in the latest exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anaemia prevalence data are generally reported disaggregated by age, sex, income, geographic region (within country) and 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; administrative level within a country. When producing estimates of anaemia for the purpose of contributing to the monitoring of SDGs, estimates are produced for women of reproductive age (15-49 years) by pregnancy status (pregnant or non-nonpregnant) for each country. Data are then aggregated by WHO or UN region and for the global level.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
