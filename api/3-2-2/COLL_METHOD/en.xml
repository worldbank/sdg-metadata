	<data>&lt;p&gt;For neonatal mortality, UNICEF and the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) compile data from all available data sources, including household surveys, censuses, and vital registration data. UNICEF and the UN IGME compile these data whenever they are available publicly and then conduct data quality assessment. UNICEF also collects data through UNICEF country offices by reaching national counterpart(s). The UN IGME also collects vital registration data reported by Ministries of Health or other relevant agencies to WHO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To increase the transparency of the estimation process, the UN IGME has developed a child mortality web portal, &lt;a href=&quot;https://childmortality.org/&quot;&gt;https://childmortality.org/&lt;/a&gt;, which includes all available data and shows estimates for each country. Once the new estimates are finalized, the web portal will be updated to reflect all available data and the new estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</data>
