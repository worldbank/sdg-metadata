	<data>&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) aims to produce transparent, timely and accurate annual estimates of under-five mortality. Data quality is critical to that end. The UN IGME assesses data quality using both internal and external validaity checks and does not include data sources with substantial non-sampling errors or omissions as underlying empirical data in its statistical model.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
