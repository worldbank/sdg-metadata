The collected data collected is revised by the Social Protection Department in order to identify internal inconsistencies between data and indicators, and detect major differences regarding indicators calculated in previous years. When significant discrepancies are detected, the questionnaires are sent back to the countries, including detailed comments, for further revision and adjustments. In many cases direct contact with national counterparts are required, as SSI application lies on a strong coordination with our governmental counterparts. </p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
