			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The compilation of social protection data is based on the ongoing implementation of SSI at the country level. The cycle of application and processing of data, information and indicators from the SSI is carried out in close coordination with the government offices of the countries concerned, with technical supervision by ILO specialists in the field offices. The information collected at the country level through the SSI is complemented with information from other national sources in order to calculate a set of variables and indicators that make up the World Social Protection Database. Quality control practices include consultations with the government agencies providing the information, comparisons with the values of the variables and indicators obtained in previous years, and application of a set of calculation and verification algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
