The MGRS collected primary growth data and related information from children from widely different ethnic backgrounds and cultural settings (Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, Oman, and the USA). The resulting growth standard can be applied to all children everywhere, regardless of ethnicity, socioeconomic status and type of feeding. The indicator refers to those moderately or severely stunted, that is with a z-score below -2 standard deviations for height-for-age from the median of the growth standard. </p>"}
