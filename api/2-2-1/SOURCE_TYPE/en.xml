	<data>&lt;p&gt;For the majority of countries, nationally representative household surveys constitute the primary data source used to generate the JME modelled estimates. For a limited number of countries, data from surveillance systems are also used as a primary data source for generation of the JME modelled estimates if sufficient population coverage is documented (about 80%). For both types of primary data sources, the child&amp;#x2019;s height/length and date of birth as well as date of measurement (to generate age in days) have to be collected following recommended standard measuring techniques (&lt;a href=&quot;https://data.unicef.org/resources/data-collection-analysis-reporting-on-anthropometric-indicators-in-children-under-5/&quot;&gt;WHO/UNICEF 2019&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;</data>
