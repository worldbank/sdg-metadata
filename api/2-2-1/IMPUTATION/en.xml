  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At country level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missing values were derived as part of the methods used to generate the JME country modelled estimates, by closely fitting the estimates from country primary data sources, with due attention to unwarranted variability. Please refer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30430613/&quot;&gt;McLain et al. 2018&lt;/a&gt; for technical details of the methods applied. Based on these methods, the JME country modelled estimates are produced from 2000 until the year before the year of publication (e.g., until 2022 for the JME 2023 edition) and used to generate regional and worldwide aggregates. For countries without any primary input data meeting inclusion criteria, the JME country modelled estimates were produced solely for generation of regional and worldwide aggregates, and were not released to the public&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At regional and worldwide levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no missing data for the generation of worldwide and regional estimates as modelled estimates are produced for all countries, those with and those without primary data in the JME country database, even though the country estimates are not released to the public for those countries without primary data. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
