	<data>&lt;p&gt;The JME working group, which was formed in 2011 with representatives from UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank, is responsible for management of the processes used to develop regular updates of the JME estimates. This includes the regular update of the country database of surveys used to generate the JME modelled estimates. Regular communication with regional and country teams allows the JME working group to secure microdata for re-analysis according to the standard method and discuss potential data quality issues. The JME working group also continuously review methods and considers and tests different methodologies to improve the estimates as necessary. Additionally, a Technical Expert Advisory Group on Nutrition Monitoring (TEAM), jointly established by UNICEF and WHO, provides advice on nutrition monitoring methods and processes, including on the JME.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
