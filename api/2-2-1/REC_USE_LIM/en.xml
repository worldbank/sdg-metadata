	<data>&lt;p&gt;Survey estimates have uncertainty due to both sampling error and non-sampling error (e.g., measurement technical error, recording error etc.,). The JME modelled estimates for stunting take into account estimates of sampling error around survey estimates. While non-sampling error cannot be accounted for or reviewed in full, when available, a data quality review of weight, height and age data from household surveys supports compilation of a time series that is comparable across countries and over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JME working group carefully utilizes all available national data sources, and documents all the steps taken to infer about country trends based on the national data sources. The estimation method (McClain et al 2018) is based on and closely aligned to country data. The approach smooths and fits a trend line across the national data points. The basis of the estimates are nationally representative household surveys. However, as surveys are conducted infrequently (e.g., less frequently than every 3 years) in some countries, models produce a complete time series with estimates available in the same years for all countries. This allows for comparable assessment of progress; for example, all countries can be assessed using the same baseline year. For any individual country, an increase in the availability of primary data points can result in more robust and accurate modelled estimates.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
