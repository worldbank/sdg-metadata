{"status":"success","message":"The DOC_METHOD field for indicator 16-7-1a, translated into en","data":"<p><strong>Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of data at national level:</strong></p>\n<p>Data on the age and sex of Members, Speakers and Committee Chairs, as well as of electoral or constitutional provisions guaranteeing representation of persons with disabilities and various population groups in parliament, will be reported directly by the IPU. The IPU already compiles this data in the New Parline database on national parliaments (<a href=\"https://data.ipu.org\">https://data.ipu.org</a>). </p>\n<p>New Parline contains data on the composition, structure and working methods of all national parliaments. New Parline was launched in September 2018, as the successor to the Parline database on national parliaments that was established by the IPU in 1996. New Parline contains some 450 different fields, which are collected or updated at varying intervals, depending on the nature of the data. Data is collected by the IPU directly from national parliaments and other official sources (such as electoral commissions). Data is collected using questionnaires and surveys that are distributed via national IPU Groups in parliament (via the Secretary General of non-member parliaments. As at 19 September 2018, the IPU has 177 members; a further 16 national parliaments are not members). Data is then processed by the IPU prior to inclusion in the database. Some fields are updated daily, while others are updated annually, after each election, or when the constitutional or legal powers of parliament are changed. Parliaments are invited to check and update their data at least annually.</p>\n<p>The IPU will inform parliaments that part of the data they provide will be used for the purpose of monitoring this indicator and will provide appropriate guidelines to respondents. In addition, the IPU will extend its data collection to include information on the age and sex of the Chairs of permanent committees on Foreign Affairs, Defense and Finance (data on Chairs of permanent committees on women and human rights is already collected within the scope of New Parline). </p>\n<p><strong>Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of data at international level:</strong></p>\n<p>The Declaration on Parliamentary Openness calls on parliaments to make publicly available information &#x201C;about the backgrounds, activities and affairs of members, including sufficient information for citizens to make informed judgments regarding their integrity and probity, and potential conflicts of interest.&#x201D; </p>\n<p>The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA)&#x2019;s Study Group on &#x2018;The Financing and Administration of Parliament&#x2019; recommended for parliaments to have in place an information strategy detailing how the membership of the Legislature will be communicated to the general public.</p>\n<p>Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU)&#x2019;s &#x201C;Guidelines for the Content and Structure of Parliamentary Websites&#x201D; (2000) recommend that for the sake of informing the electorate about Members, official parliamentary websites should feature biodata of the current speaker and a list of members and permanent committee Chairs as recommended minimum. Biodata of members is a much-welcomed optional element. </p>\n<p>Under Article 31 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, State Parties undertake to collect disaggregated information, including statistical and research data to give effect to the Convention, and assume responsibility for the dissemination of these statistics. </p>"}
