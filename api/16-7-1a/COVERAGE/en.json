While the format and scope of information provided vary, most feature the MPs&#x2019; date of birth and sex. As such, parliamentary secretariats are the primary source of data for the <strong>age </strong>and<strong> sex</strong> dimensions of this indicator. </p>\n<p>The IPU publishes data points on the sex and age of Members, Speakers and committee Chairs for the following number of countries:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Members</em>: Sex-disaggregated data available for parliaments in 193 countries and split between chambers in case of bicameral parliaments. Data on age is collected at the start of each new legislature, following parliamentary elections. The New PARLINE database provides information on the number of MPs in each parliament across 10 statistical intervals (age 18-20; age 21-30; age 31-40; age 41-45; age 46-50; age 51-60; age 61-70; age 71-80; age 81-90; age 91 and over) and the percentage of members age 45 and younger, with 45 being the cut-off age for &#x2018;young&#x2019; MPs. </li>\n  <li><em>Speakers</em>: Sex and age of Speakers available on New PARLINE for all parliamentary chambers in 193 countries. This data is updated on a daily basis, every time a change occurs. </li>\n  <li><em>Permanent committee Chairs</em>: Sex and age of chairs on committees on Human Rights and Gender Equality are featured on New PARLINE and sex and age data of foreign affairs, defence, and finance committees will be added in 2020. This data is updated after every election and checked with parliaments at the start of each year. In addition, New PARLINE provides information on the age of eligibility in all countries with national parliaments (i.e. the age of eligibility will be the cut-off age above which the demographic profile of the national population will be compared to that of members in parliament). This is required for defining the national population to be used as a comparator for the share of &#x2018;young&#x2019; MPs in parliament (see Ratio 1). This data is updated every time a change occurs. </li>\n  <li><em>National population statistics: </em>National population statistics are required to calculate the denominator of Ratio 1 (see &#x2018;Computation Method&#x2019;), namely to calculate the &#x201C;size of national population &lt; or = to 45&#x201D; and the &#x201C;size of national population &lt; age of eligibility&#x201D;, for the current year, and for both sexes combined.<em> </em><a href=\"https://emea01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpopulation.un.org%2Fwpp%2FDataQuery%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C0db59f4fb1304ea7528a08d629f1b842%7Cb3e5db5e2944483799f57488ace54319%7C0%7C0%7C636742515482684081&amp;sdata=lMZjxUY5rXE8%2FU3InZgWWkvsR60dibpPC%2FvjJ6xIH34%3D&amp;reserved=0\">The World Population Prospects 2017 database</a> is the most recent official United Nations population estimates and projections<sup><a href=\"#footnote-19\" id=\"footnote-ref-19\">[18]</a></sup>.

Estimates from the <em>World Population Prospects</em> sometimes differ from official statistics as &#x201C;official demographic statistics are affected by incompleteness of coverage, lack of timeliness and errors in the reporting or coding of the basic information. The analysis carried out by the Population Division takes into account those deficiencies and seeks to establish past population trends by resolving the inconsistencies affecting the basic data. Use of the cohort-component method to reconstruct populations is the major tool to ensure that the population trends estimated by the Population Division are internally consistent.&#x201D; The availability of data gathered by major survey programs, such as the Demographic and Health Surveys or the Multiple-Indicator Cluster Surveys, are useful in generating some of the data that is not currently being produced by official statistics.
