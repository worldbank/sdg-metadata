	<message>The FREQ_COLL field for indicator 16-7-1a, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data should be collected at least once every legislative term (preferably within 6 months of the opening of a new parliament). If possible, data should be updated annually. This will ensure timely capturing of changes in the composition of parliament and/or permanent committees which may come as a consequence of the electoral cycle, snap elections and by-elections held in selected constituencies to fill vacancies arising from the death or resignation of members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sex and age of members: updated after every election&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sex and age of Speakers: updated on a daily basis, every time a change occurs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sex and age of permanent committee Chairs: updated after every election&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data on electoral or constitutional provisions guaranteeing representation of persons with disabilities and various population groups: updated at the time of every election&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; In addition, all data will be reviewed and updated annually by parliaments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</data>
