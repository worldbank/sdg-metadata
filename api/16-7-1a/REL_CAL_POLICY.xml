&lt;p&gt;The first full release of data for the indicator will take place in February 2020, on the basis of data as at 1 January 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPU will have a rolling schedule of publication of parts of the data for the indicator in the New Parline database. For example, data on the sex of members of parliament is already available; whereas data on the age and sex of the Chairs of permanent committees on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Finance will be published in the database in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
