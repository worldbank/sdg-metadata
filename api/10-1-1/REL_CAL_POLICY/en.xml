	<data>&lt;p&gt;The World Bank Group is committed to updating the shared prosperity indicators twice every year. Given that new household surveys are not available for every year for most countries, updated estimates will be reported for only a subset of countries. Updated estimates are released at the World Bank&amp;#x2019;s Spring and Annual Meetings in April and October every year.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
