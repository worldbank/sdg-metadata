The database&#x2019;s primary source of data is the World Bank Group&#x2019;s Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP), an interactive computational tool that allows users to replicate the World Bank Group&#x2019;s official poverty estimates measured at international poverty lines ($2.15, $3.65 or $6.85 per day per capita). The datasets included in PIP are provided and reviewed by the members of the Global Poverty Working Group. The choice of consumption or income to measure shared prosperity for a country is consistent with the welfare aggregate used to estimate extreme poverty rates in PIP, unless there are strong arguments for using a different welfare aggregate. The practice adopted by the World Bank Group for estimating global and regional poverty rates is, in principle, to use per capita consumption expenditure as the welfare measure wherever available and to use income as the welfare measure for countries for which consumption data are unavailable. However, in some cases data on consumption may be available but are outdated or not shared with the World Bank Group for recent survey years. In these cases, if data on income are available, income is used for estimating shared prosperity.</p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
