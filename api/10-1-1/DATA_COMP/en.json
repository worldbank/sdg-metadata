{"status":"success","message":"The DATA_COMP field for indicator 10-1-1, translated into en","data":"<p>Growth rates are calculated as annualized average growth rates over a roughly five-year period. Since many countries do not conduct surveys on a precise five-year schedule, the following rules guide selection of the survey years used to calculate the growth rates in the 2023 update: the final year of the growth period (T1) is the most recent year of a survey but no earlier than 2018, and the initial year (T0) is as close to T1-5 as possible, within a two-year band. Thus the gap between initial and final survey years ranges from three to seven years. If two surveys are equidistant from T1-5, other things being equal, the more recent survey year is selected as T0. The comparability of welfare aggregates (income or consumption) for the years chosen for T0 and T1 is assessed for every country. If incomparability across the two surveys is a concern, the selection criteria are re-applied to select the next best survey year.</p>\n<p>A roughly five-year period is used because shorter periods may be vulnerable to short-term volatility not strongly related to long term progress. Windows longer than five years, on the other hand, would limit the number of datapoints available due to lack of comparable data within countries over longer periods of time. </p>\n<p>Once two surveys are selected for a country, consumer price indices are used to express the income or consumption of the two surveys in the same year&#x2019;s prices. Then, the annualized growth of mean per capita real income or consumption is computed by first estimating the mean per capita real income or consumption of the bottom 40% of the welfare distribution in years T0 and T1 and then computing the annual average growth rate between those years using a compound growth formula:</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">G</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">r</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">w</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">h</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">c</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">r</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">c</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">s</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">u</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">p</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <msup>\n      <mrow>\n        <mo>(</mo>\n        <mfrac>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">M</mi>\n            <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n            <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">a</mi>\n            <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n            <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n            <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n            <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n            <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n            <msub>\n              <mrow>\n                <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">T</mi>\n              </mrow>\n              <mrow>\n                <mn>1</mn>\n              </mrow>\n            </msub>\n          </mrow>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">M</mi>\n            <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n            <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">a</mi>\n            <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n            <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n            <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi>\n            <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n            <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n            <msub>\n              <mrow>\n                <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">T</mi>\n              </mrow>\n              <mrow>\n                <mn>0</mn>\n              </mrow>\n            </msub>\n          </mrow>\n        </mfrac>\n        <mo>)</mo>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mo>(</mo>\n        <mfrac bevelled=\"true\">\n          <mrow>\n            <mn>1</mn>\n          </mrow>\n          <mrow>\n            <msub>\n              <mrow>\n                <mo>(</mo>\n                <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">T</mi>\n              </mrow>\n              <mrow>\n                <mn>1</mn>\n              </mrow>\n            </msub>\n            <mo>-</mo>\n            <msub>\n              <mrow>\n                <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">T</mi>\n              </mrow>\n              <mrow>\n                <mn>0</mn>\n              </mrow>\n            </msub>\n            <mo>)</mo>\n          </mrow>\n        </mfrac>\n        <mo>)</mo>\n      </mrow>\n    </msup>\n    <mo>-</mo>\n    <mn>1</mn>\n  </math></p>\n<p>Growth of mean per capita real income or consumption of the total population is computed in the same way using data for the total population.</p>"}
