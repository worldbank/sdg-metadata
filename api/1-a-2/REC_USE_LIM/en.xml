	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 1-a-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;A high proportion of government expenditure on education demonstrates a high government priority for education relative to other public investments. The Education 2030 Framework for Action has endorsed a benchmark for this indicator, which encourages countries to allocate at least 15% to 20% of their public expenditure to education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some instances data on total public expenditure on education refer only to the Ministry of Education, excluding other ministries may also spend a part of their budget on educational activities as well as the local governments that receive block grants and do not report how much they spend on education. Although the IMF aims to publish data on total general government expenditure following common definitions based on the Government Finance Statistics Manual, in practice this concept (and what it includes) may differ between countries.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
