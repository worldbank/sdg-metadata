	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 1-a-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;There are two different methods used to collect data depending on the availability of data for a particular country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data on education expenditure are submitted by country governments in response to the annual UIS survey on formal education or to the UNESCO-OECD-Eurostat (UOE) data collection. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If a country does not respond to the annual survey, then data mining of publicly available sources as described above and then an indicator value is estimated based on a modelling approach as needed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</data>
