	<message>The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 1-a-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The source of data varies by country depending on the availability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For public expenditure on education:&lt;/strong&gt; government expenditure datasets, expenditure reports in national and sub-national budgets, the IMF Government Finance Statistics database, Public Expenditure Reviews published by the World Bank and others, the World Bank&amp;#x2019;s BOOST dataset, and other national or international sources as available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For total government expenditure:&lt;/strong&gt; the source of total government expenditure would be from a comparable source as the total amount of public expenditure on education. For example, if the expenditure amount is derived from national budget documents then total expenditure would also be derived from national budget documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that if governments have an official indicator for this SDG, then this would be the source.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</data>
