	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 17-5-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, results are available based on a detailed online questionnaire on existing outward investment promotion regimes for developing countries, including LDCs. Replies have been received from 39 countries. The answers received vary considerably in their degree of substance and detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further data will be available on the government websites of home countries. In 2021, in-house internet research provided information on 17 additional countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerning international investment agreements, UNCTAD&amp;#x2019;s database on this aspect is comprehensive and currently includes detailed information on over 3,300 treaties, including agreements concluded with or between LDCs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data on international investment agreements comprehensively covers bilateral investment treaties, the main type of such agreements, signed from 1959 to 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, and to the extent that information is available, indicator 17.5.1 can be disaggregated by type of investment promotion regimes that home countries adopt for developing countries, including LDCs (e.g. investment guarantees, fiscal and financial aid, IIAs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A geographical breakdown of the adoption of investment promotion schemes would also be possible. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
