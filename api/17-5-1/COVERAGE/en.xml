	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 17-5-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, results are available based on a detailed online questionnaire on existing outward investment promotion regimes which can benefit developing countries, including LDCs. Replies have been received from 35 countries. The answers received vary considerably in their degree of substance and detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further data will be available on the government websites of home countries. In 2022, in-house internet research provided information on 15 additional countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of the change in the metric utilized for the measurement of this indicator in 2023, the baseline year is 2022. Data on international investment agreements (IIA) concluded with LDCs, which constituted the original measurement for this indicator, can still be accessed on UNCTAD&amp;#x2019;s IIA navigator, at: https://investmentpolicy.unctad.org/international-investment-agreements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicator 17.5.1 can be disaggregated by type of investment promotion regimes that home countries adopt for developing countries, including LDCs (e.g. investment guarantees, fiscal and financial aid and investment facilitation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A geographical breakdown of the adoption of investment promotion schemes would also be possible. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
