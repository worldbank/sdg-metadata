	<message>The STAT_CONC_DEF field for indicator 17-5-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator provides the number of countries that have adopted and implemented investment promotion regimes for developing countries, including least developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concepts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Investment promotion regimes&lt;/u&gt; can be defined as those instruments that directly aim at encouraging outward or inward foreign investment through particular measures of the home or host countries of investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment promotion regimes for LDCs are those instruments that &lt;em&gt;home countries&lt;/em&gt; of investors have put in place to &lt;em&gt;encourage outward investment in LDCs directly or through measures intended for developing countries. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Home country&lt;/u&gt; refers to donor countries that put in place investment promotion regimes to encourage outward investment in developing countries, including LDCs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Foreign direct investment&lt;/u&gt; involves a long-term relationship and reflects a lasting interest and control by a resident entity in one economy (foreign direct investor or parent enterprise) in an enterprise resident in an economy other than that of the foreign direct investor (FDI enterprise or affiliate enterprise or foreign affiliate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adoption&lt;/u&gt; means that a country has put in place such a system i.e. through the formal adoption of a law, regulation or programme to encourage investment in developing countries, including LDCs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Implementation&lt;/u&gt; means that a country has actually started to promote individual investments in developing countries, including LDCs, on the basis of the relevant legislation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Instruments&lt;/u&gt; used under investment promotion regimes include investment guarantees, financial or fiscal support for outward investors as well as the conclusion of international investment agreements between the home and the host country of the investor. Besides these legal instruments, countries often also provide information and other advisory services for their outward investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Investment guarantee&lt;/u&gt; is an insurance, offered by governments of the home country or other institutions, to investors to protect against certain political risks in host countries, such as the risk of discrimination, expropriation, transfer restrictions or breach of contract&lt;u&gt;.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;International investment agreement&lt;/u&gt; is a treaty between two or more countries regarding the promotion and protection of investments made by investors from one country in the other country&amp;#x2019;s territory, which commits the host country government to grant certain standards of treatment and protection to foreign investors (nationals and companies of the other country) and their investments.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
