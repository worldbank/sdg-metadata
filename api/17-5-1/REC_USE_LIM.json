The adoption of investment promotion regimes for LDCs is an important yet not sufficient means for strengthening the global partnership for the SGDs (Goal 17). Subsequent implementation of these regimes is necessary for making the tool effective. However, getting comprehensive and reliable data on the implementation stage (i.e. how many investments in LDCs have actually been promoted through the promotion regime?) will be difficult. These data are usually not publicly available. However, to some extent, data may exist in aggregate form (see below). </p>\n<p>Furthermore, the pilot study indicated that many developed countries and some emerging economies have national investment promotion regimes in place that encourage investment abroad. Usually, however, these promotion regimes are available for outward investment in any country &#x2013; not only for investment in LDCs or other developing economies. Some types of investment promotion tools can be more country-specific, like bilateral investment treaties. Therefore, indicator reporting will be started with preliminary estimates covering these types of investment promotion tools only.</p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
