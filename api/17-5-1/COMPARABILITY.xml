&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, countries have different outward investment promotion regimes in operation. Differences exist concerning: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x25CF; the specificity of the system (does it target exclusively investment in LDCs or investment in any developing country?);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x25CF; the type and number of investment promotion instruments (investment guarantees, fiscal or financial support, IIAs);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x25CF; the degree of investment promotion (how much support does the individual promotion measure provide?), and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x25CF; the actual impact of the investment promotion regime (how many investments have been made under the promotion regime and what effect do they have in the LDCs?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicator 17.5.1 measures the number of countries that have an investment promotion regime in place which can benefit developing countries, including LDCs. Counting this number cannot provide a complete picture of the content and impact of these regimes. Likewise, it does not differentiate between countries with different types of regimes &amp;#x2013; except for the distinction between countries that promote outward investment in LDCs through an LDC-specific promotion system and those with a more general promotion regime. Therefore, disaggregation of the indicator should be gradually increased as more data become available. Further work to measure the &amp;#x201C;implementation&amp;#x201D; of investment promotion regimes for developing countries, including LDCs, could be pursued in the longer-term.&lt;/p&gt;
