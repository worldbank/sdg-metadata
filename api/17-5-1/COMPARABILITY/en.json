Counting this number cannot provide a complete picture of the content and impact of these regimes. Likewise, it does not differentiate between countries with different types of regimes &#x2013; except for the distinction between countries that promote outward investment in LDCs through an LDC-specific promotion system and those with a more general promotion regime. Therefore, disaggregation of the indicator should be gradually increased as more data become available. Further work to measure the &#x201C;implementation&#x201D; of investment promotion regimes for developing countries, including LDCs, could be pursued in the longer-term.</p>"}
