			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;This indicator is derived from surveys on crime victimization or from other household surveys with a module on crime victimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator refers to individual experience of the respondent, who is randomly selected among the household members, while experience of other members is not to be included. Experience of violent victimization is collected through a series of questions on concrete acts of violence suffered by the respondent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNODC collects data on the prevalence of physical and sexual assault through its annual data collection (UN-CTS). The data collection through the UN-CTS is facilitated by a network of over 130 national Focal Points appointed by responsible authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
