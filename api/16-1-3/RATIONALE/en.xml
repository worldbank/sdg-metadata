	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 16-1-3, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;This indicator measures the prevalence of victimization from physical, sexual (and, possibly, psychological) violence. It is globally relevant as violence in various forms occurs in all regions and countries of the world. Given that acts of violence are heavily underreported to the authorities, this indicator needs to be based on data collected through sample surveys of the adult population.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
