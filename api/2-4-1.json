This choice of scope is fully consistent with the intended use of a country&#x2019;s agricultural land area as the denominator of the aggregate indicator. Specifically, the following are:</p>\n<p>Included within scope:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Intensive and extensive crops and livestock production systems.</li>\n  <li>Subsistence agriculture.</li>\n  <li>State and common land when used exclusively and managed by the farm holding.</li>\n  <li>Food and non-food crops and livestock products (e.g. tobacco, cotton, and sheep wool). </li>\n  <li>Crops grown for fodder or for energy purposes.</li>\n  <li>Agro-forestry (trees on the agriculture areas of the farm).</li>\n  <li>Aquaculture, to the extent that it takes place within the agricultural land area.

The key considerations in the selection of themes are relevance and measurability. In terms of relevance, the relationship between the associated sub-indicator and sustainable agriculture outcomes at farm level should be strong. Following this approach, only sub-indicators that are responsive to farm level policies aimed at improving sustainable agriculture are considered. In terms of measurability, only a &#x201C;core&#x201D; set of themes and sub-indicators for which measurement and reporting is expected in the majority of countries are selected.</p>\n<p>A key aspect of all approaches to measuring sustainable agriculture is the recognition that sustainability is a multi-dimensional concept, and that these multiple dimensions need to be reflected in the construction of the indicator. This implies that SDG indicator 2.4.1 must be based on a set of sub-indicators that cover these three dimensions.</p>\n<p>Through a consultative process that has lasted over two years, 11 themes and sub-indicators have been identified, which make up SDG 2.4.1.</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <h2>No.</h2>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <h2>Themes</h2>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <h2>Sub-indicators</h2>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>1</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Land productivity</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Farm output value per hectare</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>2</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Profitability</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Net farm income </p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>3</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Resilience</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Risk mitigation mechanisms </p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>4</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Soil health</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Prevalence of soil degradation</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>5</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Water use</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Variation in water availability</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>6</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Fertilizer pollution risk</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Management of fertilizers</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>7</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Pesticide risk</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Management of pesticides </p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>8</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Biodiversity</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Use of agro-biodiversity-supportive practices </p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>9</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Decent employment</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Wage rate in agriculture</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>10</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Food security</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>11</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Land tenure</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Secure tenure rights to land</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Please see the annex for a detailed description of the sub-indicators.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">1</sup><p> The countries will define hobby farms as per their national criteria and remove these farms from the population of interest for 2.4.1 until an international definition is available. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-2\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div><p>Percentage (%):The member countries are required to report the proportion (percentage) of agriculture land area for all 11 sub-indicators separately by sustainability status. Aggregation at the national level is performed for each sub-indicator independently, by adding up the agricultural land area of each agriculture holding (selected through a nationally representative sample) and finally reporting the resulting national total as a percentage of the total nationally representative agriculture land area for the 11 sub-indicators in a dashboard. </p><p>The land area classification is that implemented in the FAO Land Use, Irrigation and Agricultural Practices Questionnaire (<a href=\"http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RL/metadata\">http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RL/metadata</a>), which is consistent with the classification of Census of Agriculture and the System of Environmental and Economic Accounts (SEEA). </p><p>Different data are collected through different instruments. Often, environmental data are collected through environmental monitoring systems, including remote sensing. Yet many countries do not have the capacity or resources to do so, and therefore these data are sparse or non-existent. In order to propose a manageable and cost-effective solution, a requirement stressed by several countries during the consultations, the methodology offers a single data collection instrument for all sub-indicators: the farm survey.<br></p>\n<p>Several countries have suggested using existing data sources or alternative data sources on the grounds that these instruments can be more cost-effective and sometimes provide more reliable results than farm surveys. These instruments include remote sensing, GIS, models, agricultural surveys, household surveys, administrative data or environmental monitoring systems. The methodology considers the possibility to use such instruments, subject to a series of criteria to ensure data quality and international comparability. Other data sources may also be used to complement and/or validate farm survey results.</p>\n<p>The methodology note also recommends that countries complement the farm survey with a monitoring systems that can measure the impact of agriculture on the environment (soil, water, fertilizer and pesticide pollution, biodiversity, etc.) and on health (pesticides residues in food and human bodies). This will provide additional information and help crosscheck the robustness of SDG indicator 2.4.1 with regard to the environmental dimension of sustainability.</p><p>A questionnaire is sent to all countries annually since 2020 (<a href=\"http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators/241/en/\">http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators/241/en/</a>). Furthermore, in order to facilitate data collection by countries, a data module has been designed, which contains the core set of questions necessary to obtain the data for SDG 2.4.1. If farm surveys already exist within a country, these questions can be integrated into existing instruments in order to minimize the burden to National Statistical Offices (NSOs).</p>\n<p>All data collection activities will be done through the NSO or the office designated to collect data for this indicator. FAO, together with the Global Strategy to improve Agriculture and Rural Statistics (GSARS), have developed the capacity development material necessary for this indicator, including a methodological guide, an enumerator manual, calculation document, sampling guidance and an e-learning course to train country NSO and other relevant staff on the indictor. </p><p>Data collection will depend on currently existing data collection cycles for farm surveys within countries. FAO has integrated the questionnaire module associated with this indicator in in AGRISurvey Programme and 50x2030 initiative.</p><p>Although new data may not be available annually for each country, all new information is expected to be released annually through FAOSTAT.</p><p>National Statistical Offices or designated offices within countries will be responsible for collecting data for this indicator.</p><p>National Statistical Offices or designated offices within countries will be responsible for collecting and compiling data for this indicator.

FAO will in turn report to the international statistical community and UNSD.</p><p>Article I of the FAO constitution requires that the Organization collect, analyses, interpret and disseminate information relating to nutrition, food and agriculture <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/K8024E/K8024E.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/3/K8024E/K8024E.pdf</a>. </p><p>The approaches to framing and defining sustainable agriculture vary in terms of their coverage of the three primary dimensions of sustainability, i.e. economic, environmental and social, and in terms of the scale that is used to assess sustainability, i.e. from field and farm scales, to national and global scales. Some approaches consider different features of sustainability, for example whether current practices are economically feasible, environmentally friendly and socially desirable. Other approaches focus on particular practices such as organic, regenerative or low-input agriculture and can equate these with sustainable agriculture. </p>\n<p>The conclusion from a literature review associated with the methodological development of this indicator is that the multi-dimensional approach developed by FAO in 1988 is a meaningful framing of the concept. Thus, sustainable agriculture can be considered as &#x201C;the management and conservation of the natural resource base, and the orientation of technological and institutional change in such a manner as to ensure the attainment and continued satisfaction of human needs for present and future generation. Such development (in agriculture, forestry and fishing etc.) conserves land, water, plant and animal genetic resources, environmentally non-degrading, technically appropriate, economically viable and socially acceptable.&#x201D; (FAO, 1988)</p><p>During the consultations undertaken, several countries highlighted the difficulties in combining data from different sources and requested that this be avoided to the extent possible. Other, relatively data rich, countries, instead, insisted on the need to allow for the use of existing data sources. The updated methodology addresses both concerns: it offers the farm survey as a single data collection instrument for all sub-indicators, but it also offers the possibility of using a combination of different data sources as an alternative option as long as certain criteria are satisfied.</p>\n<p>The decision to use the farm survey as a data collection instrument for this indicator is in line with countries&#x2019; efforts, supported by FAO, to develop farm surveys as the most appropriate tool for generating agricultural statistics. It also benefits from the FAO work in developing the Agricultural Integrated Survey (AGRIS) programme, which is implemented as part of a new initiative called <a href=\"http://www.data4sdgs.org/50by2030\">50 X 2030</a>. </p>\n<p>The decision to focus on farm survey has implications on the type of information that it is possible to capture in order to cover the different dimensions of sustainability. While farm surveys are well suited to measure the economic dimension of sustainability, they may not be the ideal tool for measuring environmental and social sustainability in terms of impact/outcomes. </p>\n<p>Typically, environmental impacts of agriculture are measured through monitoring systems like remote sensing, soil and water sampling, or other tools associated with a specific area, rather than with a single agricultural holding. For several environmental themes, it is unlikely that farmers would be able to assess the environmental impact of their farming practices on issues like fertilizer pollution or pesticide impact. Using a farm survey instrument, instead of environmental monitoring systems, therefore implies moving from measuring outcome/impact to assessing farmers&#x2019; practices. Whenever possible, however, the revised methodology continues to focus on measuring outcomes. </p>\n<p>Similarly, the sub-themes under the social dimension are usually best captured through household surveys. While in the majority of cases agricultural holdings are closely associated with a given household, this is not always the case, and therefore capturing the social dimension of sustainability through a farm survey, especially if it is not designed to cover social aspects could pose certain challenges.</p><p>The indicator is defined by the formula:</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi>S</mi>\n    <mi>D</mi>\n    <mi>G</mi>\n    <mn>2</mn>\n    <mo>.</mo>\n    <mn>4</mn>\n    <mo>.</mo>\n    <mn>1</mn>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>A</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>p</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>c</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>v</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>b</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>g</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>c</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>A</mi>\n        <mi>g</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>c</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n  </math></p>\n<p>This implies the need to measure both the extent of land under productive and sustainable agriculture (the numerator), as well as the extent of agriculture land area (the denominator).</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The <em>numerator</em> captures the three dimensions of sustainable production: environmental, economic and social.

Forestry, fisheries and aquaculture activities may be included to the extent that they are secondary activities conducted on the agricultural area of the farm holding, for example rice-fish farming and similar systems.</li>\n  <li>Determining the <strong>dimensions </strong>to be covered: Indicator 2.4.1 includes environmental, economic and social dimensions in the sustainability assessment. </li>\n  <li>Choosing the <strong>scale </strong>for the sustainability assessment: Indicator 2.4.1 is farm level with aggregation to higher levels.</li>\n  <li>Selecting the data collection <strong>instrument(s)</strong>:<strong> </strong>It is recommended that indicator 2.4.1 be collected through a farm survey.</li>\n  <li>Selecting the <strong>themes </strong>within each dimension, and choosing a <strong>sub-indicator</strong> for each theme: The sub-indicators should satisfy a number of criteria (described in annex 1 for each sub-indicator, respectively). </li>\n  <li>Assessing <strong>sustainability performance at farm level for each sub-indicator</strong>: Specific sustainability <strong>criteria</strong> are applied in order to assess the sustainability level of the farm for each theme according to the respective sub-indicators. </li>\n  <li>Deciding the <strong>periodicity of monitoring the indicator</strong>: It is recommended to be collected at least every three years.</li>\n  <li><strong>Modality of reporting the indicator</strong>:<strong> </strong>The set of sub-indicators are presented in the form of a <strong>dashboard</strong>. The dashboard approach offers a response in terms of measuring sustainability at farm level and aggregating it at national level. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>The 2.4.1 methodology proposes reporting of indicator 2.4.1 through a national-level dashboard, presenting the different sub-indicators together but independently. The dashboard approach offers several advantages, including the possibility of combining data from different sources and identification of critical sustainability issues, facilitating the search for a balance between the three sustainability dimensions. As a result, countries can easily visualize their performance in terms of the different sustainability dimensions and themes, and understand where policy efforts can be focused for future improvements.</p>\n<p>Computation of results and construction of the dashboard are performed for each sub-indicator separately using the &#x2018;traffic light&#x2019; approach already defined for each sub-indicator: aggregation at national level is performed for each sub-indicator independently, by summing the agricultural land area of each agricultural holdings by sustainability category (red, yellow or green), and reporting the resulting national total as percentage of the total national agricultural land area of all agricultural farm holdings in the country. In practice, the reported value of Indicator 2.4.1 is determined by the results of most-limiting sub-indicator in terms of sustainability performance.</p><p>The data undergo comprehensive validation work that cover: detection of outliers, transmission errors and data consistency checks. Countries asked to examine the disseminated results for their country and either to confirm that they are correct or to provide remarks and/or revise data if they identify errors. </p><p>Adjustments to total national agricultural area may be made to correct for common areas that are out of scope with regards to the indicator methodology.</p><p><strong>&#x2022;</strong> <strong>At country level</strong></p>\n<p>Partial non-response at individual level (farm holding) will be imputed using appropriate statistical techniques, such as nearest-neighbour algorithms. The decision on whether to impute or not and the choice of the method is a function of the nature of the variable to impute and the amount and type of data available for the imputation, such as the availability of auxiliary data coming from different sources (e.g. surveys, administrative information). </p>\n<p>It is important to clearly distinguish missing data from non-applicable events. As specified above and in the sub-indicator methodology sheets, some sub-indicators can be recorded as &#x2018;not applicable&#x2019; for a given farm. In this case, the farm will be considered sustainable from the perspective of the given sub-indicators.</p>\n<p>At the country level, if and when data are provided using alternative sources for some of the sub-indicators, relevant notes to be provided by the country explaining the type, nature, source and time period of the data reported. </p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022;</strong> <strong>At regional and global levels</strong></p>\n<p>No treatment of missing values will be carried out at the regional and global level. The regional and global estimates will be constructed using data of countries that have reported all 11 sub-indicators and/or those that have reported a sub-set of the 11 only if some of the sub-indicators are not applicable or irrelevant in the context of those country. </p><p>These data will be disseminated through FAOSTAT, the largest database of food and agricultural statistics.

Farm output value per hectare</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension: </strong>Economic<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Theme: </strong>Land Productivity </p>\n<p>Land productivity is a measure of agricultural value of outputs obtained on a given area of land. Maintaining or improving the output over time relative to the area of land used is an important aspect in sustainability for a range of reasons. At farm level, the land productivity reflects technology and production processes for given agro-ecological conditions. In a broader sense, an increase in the level of land productivity enables higher production while reducing pressure on increasingly scarce land resources, commonly linked to deforestation and associated losses of ecosystem services and biodiversity.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Coverage</strong>: All farm types </p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong></p>\n<p>The sub-indicator is described as farm output value per hectare (holdings that produce crops and livestock or its mix). Information on farm outputs and agricultural area should be standard information available from farm surveys thus providing a good basis for assessment at farm level.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Farm output value: The volume of agricultural output at farm level generally takes into account production of multiple outputs, e.g. crop types and crop and livestock combinations, etc. Since the volume of agricultural outputs is not measured in commensurate units (e.g. not all outputs are measured in tonnes, and tonnes of different output represent different products), it is necessary to establish an appropriate means of aggregation, in this case using a monetary unit. A simple way to enable aggregation is to reflect the multiple outputs produced by a single farm in terms of values (i.e. quantity multiplied by prices).</li>\n  <li>Farm agricultural land area: defined as the area of land used for agriculture within the farm<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[2]</a></sup>. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sustainability criteria: </strong></p>\n<p>Distance from the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile of the national distribution<sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-ref-4\">[3]</a></sup>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Green (desirable): Sub-indicator value is &#x2265; 2/3 of the corresponding 90<sup>th</sup> percentile </li>\n  <li>Yellow (acceptable): Sub-indicator value is &#x2265; 1/3 and &lt; 2/3 of the corresponding 90<sup>th</sup> percentile </li>\n  <li>Red (unsustainable): Sub-indicator value is &lt; 1/3 of the corresponding 90<sup>th</sup> percentile</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Data items:</strong></p>\n<p>Reference period: last calendar year</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ol>\n      <li>Quantities and farm gate prices (or value of production) of the 5 main crops and/or livestock products and by-products produced by the farm</li>\n      <li>Quantities and farm gate prices (or value of production) of other agricultural products (agro-forestry or aquaculture products etc.) produced by the farm </li>\n      <li>Agricultural land area of the holding</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>2. Net Farm Income:</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension:</strong> Economic<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Theme:</strong> Profitability</p>\n<p>An important part of sustainability in agriculture is the economic viability of the farm, driven to a large extent by its profitability. Profitability is measured using the net income that the farmer is able to gain from farming operations. Availability and use of information on farm economic performance, measured using profitability, will support better decision making both at micro and macro-economic level. Since performance measures drive behaviour, better information on performance can alter behaviour and decision-making by government and producers both in large-scale commercial farming and medium and small-scale subsistence agriculture.</p>\n<p><strong>Coverage:</strong> All farms types </p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong></p>\n<p>The sub-indicator measures if the farm is consistently profitable over a 3-year period. The focus of this sub-indicator is on income from farming operations as distinct from the total income of the farming household, which may include other sources of income such as, for example, employment in local businesses by other family members, tourism activity, etc.</p>\n<p>Formula<sup><a href=\"#footnote-5\" id=\"footnote-ref-5\">[4]</a></sup>:</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi>N</mi>\n    <mi>F</mi>\n    <mi>I</mi>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>C</mi>\n    <mi>R</mi>\n    <mo>+</mo>\n    <msub>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>Y</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>k</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msub>\n    <mo>-</mo>\n    <mi>O</mi>\n    <mi>E</mi>\n    <mo>-</mo>\n    <mi>D</mi>\n    <mi>e</mi>\n    <mi>p</mi>\n    <mo>+</mo>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>V</mi>\n    <mi>I</mi>\n    <mi>C</mi>\n  </math></p>\n<p>where:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>NFI = Total Net Farm Income</li>\n  <li>CR = Total farm cash receipts including direct program payments</li>\n  <li>Y<sub>k</sub> = Income in kind</li>\n  <li>OE = Total operating expenses after rebates (including costs of labour)</li>\n  <li>Dep = Depreciation</li>\n  <li>VIC = Value of inventory change</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Definitions:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Net farm income refers to the return (both monetary and non-monetary) to farm operators for their labor, management and capital, after all production expenses have been paid (that is, gross farm income minus production expenses). It includes net income from farm production, the value of commodities consumed on the farm, depreciation, and inventory changes.</li>\n  <li>Gross farm income refers to the monetary and non-monetary income received by farm. Its main components include cash receipts from the sale of farm products, direct program payments to producers, other farm income (such as income from custom work), value of food and fuel produced and consumed on the same farm, and change in value of year-end inventories of crops and livestock<sup><a href=\"#footnote-6\" id=\"footnote-ref-6\">[5]</a></sup>.</li>\n  <li>Farm cash receipts include revenues from the sale of agricultural commodities in local currency units that include sales of crops, livestock and its by-products.</li>\n  <li>Direct program payments to producers included in farm cash receipts represent the amounts paid under various government and private programs to individuals involved in agricultural production. The payments related to current agricultural production include subsidies to encourage production or to compensate producers for low market returns, payments to stabilize incomes and payments to compensate producers for crop or livestock losses caused by extreme climatic conditions, disease or other reasons and insurance payments.</li>\n  <li>Income-in-kind measures the value of the agricultural goods produced on farms and consumed by farm operator families. It is included to measure total farm production. </li>\n  <li>Operating expenses represent business costs incurred by farm businesses for goods and services used in the production process. Expenses include both purchase and self-produced items that are: property taxes, custom work, seeds, rent, fertiliser and lime, chemicals, machinery and building repairs, irrigation, fuel for heating and machines, wages, interest and business share of insurance premiums. </li>\n  <li>Depreciation charges account for the economic depreciation or for the loss in fair market value of the capital assets of the farm business. Calculated on farm buildings, farm machinery, and the farm business share of autos, trucks and the farm home, depreciation is generally considered to be the result of aging, wear and tear, and obsolescence. It represents a decrease in the potential economic benefits that can be generated by the capital asset. </li>\n  <li>Value of inventory change (VIC) measures the currency value of the physical change in producer-owned inventories. This concept is used to value total agricultural economic production. To calculate VIC, the change in producer-owned inventories (between the end and the beginning of a calendar year) is first derived and then multiplied by the average annual crop prices or value per animal. This calculation is different from the financial or accounting book value approach, which values the beginning and ending stocks, and then derives the change.</li>\n  <li>The VIC over all the major commodities can vary widely (depending on the size of the change of inventories and prices). The VIC can be either positive (when inventories are larger at the end of the year compared to the beginning levels) or negative (when year- end inventories are smaller than the levels at the beginning of the year). If the inventory levels are the same at the beginning and end of the year, VIC will be zero despite price changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Estimating profitability at a farm level will generally require compilation of basic farm financial records, i.e. daily, weekly, monthly or seasonal transactions in an organized way. In general, large commercial farms maintain detailed financial records however, in case of medium farms and small subsistence agriculture, record keeping is seldom practiced and in most of the countries it doesn&#x2019;t exist at all. </p>\n<p>In case when detailed data are not available at farm level, then estimates will be calculated based on farmer declaration of both outputs and inputs quantities and prices. In these cases, depreciation, variation of stocks and taxes may be neglected. This is described below as simplified option (1).</p>\n<p>A simplified option (2) is also offered, based on farmer&#x2019;s declaration of the agricultural holding&#x2019;s profitability over the last three calendar years. It is recommended to use this simplified option only when other two options are not feasible.</p>\n<p><strong>Sustainability criteria: </strong></p>\n<p>For a farm to be profitable the net farm income should be above zero. </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Green (desirable): above zero for past 3 consecutive years</li>\n  <li>Yellow (acceptable): above zero for at least 1 of the past 3 consecutive years</li>\n  <li>Red (unsustainable): below zero for all of the past 3 consecutive years</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Data items:</strong></p>\n<p>Reference period: last three calendar years</p>\n<p><strong><em>Recommended option:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Data from farm financial records, i.e. daily, weekly, monthly or seasonal transactions are collected in an organized way (in general, large commercial farms maintain detailed financial records on the basis of which the NFI can be calculated as per above equation). </p>\n<p><strong><em>Simplified option (1):</em></strong></p>\n<p>To be used when the detailed data are not available at farm level (better adapted to smallholders and household sector). </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ol>\n      <li>Quantity produced (i.e. crops and livestock and its products and by-products produced both for market or self-consumption) </li>\n      <li>Farm gate prices of the above quantities produces</li>\n      <li>Operating expenses including inputs quantities and its market prices</li>\n      <li>Quantity/output of other on-farm activities carried out and/or commodities produced on the holding e.g. aquaculture, agroforestry and others</li>\n      <li>Farm gate prices of the other on-farm activities/commodities</li>\n      <li>Input quantities and prices that are used to produce other on-farm outputs</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Simplified option (2):</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ol>\n      <li>Respondent&#x2019;s declaration on agricultural holding&#x2019;s profitability over the last 3 calendar years</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>3. Risk mitigation mechanisms</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension: </strong>Economic<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Theme: </strong>Resilience</p>\n<p>Resilience encompass absorptive, anticipatory and adaptive capacities and refers to the properties of a system that allows farms to deal with shocks and stresses, to persist and to continue to be well-functioning (in the sense of providing stability, predictable rules, security and other benefits to its members). </p>\n<p><strong>Coverage: </strong>All farms types<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong></p>\n<p>This sub-indicator measures the incidence of the following mitigation mechanisms: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Access to or availed credit<sup><a href=\"#footnote-7\" id=\"footnote-ref-7\">[6]</a></sup></li>\n  <li>Access to or availed insurance</li>\n  <li>On farm diversification (share of a single agricultural commodity not greater than 66% in the total value of production of the holding)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Access to credit and/or insurance is defined here as when a given service is available and the holder has enough means to obtain the service (required documents, collateral, positive credit history, etc.). Broadly, access to one or more the above 3 factors will allow the farm to prevent, resist, adapt and recover from external shocks such as, floods, droughts, market failure (e.g. price shock), climate shock and pest/animal diseases. </p>\n<p><strong>Sustainability criteria: </strong></p>\n<p>A farm holding is considered resilient if it has availed or has the means to access the risk mitigation mechanisms as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Green (desirable): Access to or availed at least two of the above-listed mitigation mechanisms.</li>\n  <li>Yellow (acceptable): Access to or availed at least one of the above-listed mitigation mechanisms.</li>\n  <li>Red (unsustainable): No access to the listed mitigation mechanisms. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Data items:</strong></p>\n<p>Reference period: last calendar year</p>\n<p>3.1.

Prevalence of soil degradation</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension: </strong>Environmental<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Theme: </strong>Soil health </p>\n<p>Many of the processes affecting soil health are driven by agricultural practices. FAO and the Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils (ITPS) have identified 10 main threats to soil functions: soil erosion; soil organic carbon losses; nutrient imbalance; acidification; contamination; waterlogging; compaction; soil sealing; salinization and loss of soil biodiversity. </p>\n<p><strong>Coverage: </strong>All farms types<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong></p>\n<p>The sub-indicator measures the extent to which agriculture activities affects soil health and therefore represents a sustainability issue. A review of the 10 threats to soil shows that all except one (soil sealing, which is the loss of natural soil to construction/urbanisation) are potentially and primarily affected by inappropriate agricultural practices. Ideally, therefore, all soils under agricultural land area in a country should be the subject of periodic monitoring in order to assess the impact of agriculture on soils. This requires detailed surveys and sampling campaigns, associated with laboratory testing. In order to propose a manageable solution while capturing the main trends in the country in terms of soil health, the farm survey focuses on the four threats that combine the characteristics more widespread (for national monitoring, countries may choose to add any of the other areas indicated above, depending on relevance), and easier to assess through farm surveys:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Soil erosion</li>\n  <li>Reduction in soil fertility</li>\n  <li>Salinization of irrigated land</li>\n  <li>Waterlogging</li>\n  <li>Other - Specify</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The farm survey captures farmer&#x2019;s knowledge about the situation of the agricultural holding in terms of soil degradation. Experience has shown that farmers are very much aware of the state of their soils, health and degradation level. Farmers may also be offered the opportunity to mention other threats than the above four. </p>\n<p>Other data sources on soil health may either complement the information collected through the farm survey and offer opportunities for cross-checking farmers&#x2019; responses; or be used as alternative sources of data. Prior to the farm survey, a desk study could collect all available information on soil health, including using national official statistics or statistics available from international agencies such as FAO. This typically includes maps, models, results from soil sampling, laboratory analysis and field surveys, and all existing report on soil and land degradation at national level. On the basis of this information, maps or tables (by administrative boundaries or other divisions of the country) can be established, showing the threats to soils according to the above 4 categories of threats.</p>\n<p><strong>Sustainability criteria: </strong></p>\n<p>Proportion of agricultural area of the farm affected by soil degradation.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Green (desirable): The combined area affected by any of the four selected threats to soil health is negligible (less than 10% of the total agriculture area of the farm).</li>\n  <li>Yellow (acceptable): The combined area affected by any of the four selected threats to soil health is between 10% and 50% of the total agriculture area of the farm.</li>\n  <li>Red (unsustainable): The combined area affected by any of the four selected threats to soil health is above 50% of the total agriculture area of the farm.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Data items:</strong></p>\n<p>Reference period: last three calendar years</p>\n<p>4.1 List of soil degradation threats experienced on the holding</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Soil erosion (loss of topsoil through wind or water erosion)</li>\n      <li>Reduction in soil fertility<sup><a href=\"#footnote-8\" id=\"footnote-ref-8\">[7]</a></sup></li>\n      <li>Salinization of irrigated land</li>\n      <li>Waterlogging</li>\n      <li>Other &#x2013; Specify</li>\n      <li>None of the above</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>4.2 Total area of the holding affected by threats related to soil degradation</p>\n<h3><strong>5. Variation in water availability</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension:</strong> Environmental </p>\n<p><strong>Theme:</strong> Water use</p>\n<p>Agriculture, more specifically irrigated agriculture, is by far the main economic sector using freshwater resources. In many places, water withdrawal from rivers and groundwater aquifers is beyond what can be considered environmentally sustainable. This affects both rivers and underground aquifers. Sustainable agriculture therefore requires that that level of use of freshwater for irrigation remains within acceptable boundaries. While there are no internationally agreed standards of water use sustainability, signals associated with unsustainable use of water typically include progressive reduction in the level of groundwater, drying out of springs and rivers, increased conflicts among water users. </p>\n<p><strong>Coverage: </strong>All farm types<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong></p>\n<p>The sub-indicator captures the extent to which agriculture contributes to unsustainable patterns of water use. Ideally, the level of sustainability in water use is measured at the scale of the river basin or groundwater aquifer, as it is the combined effect of all users sharing the same resource that impact water sustainability. The farm survey captures farmers&#x2019; awareness and behaviour in relation with water scarcity, and associates them with three levels of sustainability. These awareness and behaviour are expressed in terms of:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>whether the farmer uses water to irrigate crops on at least 10% of the agriculture area of the farm and why, if the answer is negative (does not need, cannot afford);</li>\n  <li>whether the farmer is aware about issues of water availability in the area of the farm and notices a reduction in water availability over time;</li>\n  <li>whether there are organizations (water users organisations, others) in charge of allocating water among users and the extent to which these organisations are working effectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other data sources may either complement the farm survey on water use and offer opportunities for cross-checking farmers&#x2019; responses; or be used as alternative sources of data. Prior to the farm survey, a desk study should collect all available information on water balance, including national official statistics or statistics available from international agencies such as FAO. Information on water resources and use is usually collected by the entities in charge of water management or monitoring and are organised by hydrological entity (river basin or groundwater aquifer). They typically include hydrological records (river flow, groundwater levels), models and maps showing the extent of water use by hydrological entity.</p>\n<p><strong>Sustainability criteria: </strong></p>\n<p>Farm sustainability in relation with water use will be assessed as follows: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Green (desirable): Water availability remains stable over the years, for farms irrigating crops on more than 10% of the agriculture area of the farm. Default result for farms irrigating less than 10% of their agricultural area </li>\n  <li>Yellow (acceptable): uses water to irrigate crops on at least 10% of the agriculture area of the farm, does not know whether water availability remains stable over the years, or experiences reduction on water availability over the years, but there is an organisation that effectively allocates water among users. </li>\n  <li>Red (unsustainable): in all other cases. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Data items:</strong></p>\n<p>Reference period: last three calendar years</p>\n<p>5.1 Irrigated agricultural area of the holding </p>\n<p>5.2 Reduction in water availability experienced on the holding</p>\n<p>5.3 Existence of organizations dealing with water allocation </p>\n<h3><strong>6. Management of fertilizers</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension: </strong>Environmental<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Theme: </strong>Fertilizer pollution risk </p>\n<p>Agriculture can affect the quality of the environment through excessive use or inadequate management of fertilizers. Sustainable agriculture implies that the level of chemicals in soil and water bodies remains within acceptable thresholds. Integrated plant nutrient management considers all sources of nutrients (mineral and organic) and their management in order to obtain best nutrient balance. Measuring soil and water quality captures the extent and causes of pollution, but establishing monitoring systems of soil and water is costly and not always feasible in countries. </p>\n<p>Note: the management of plant nutrients addresses two sustainability issues: avoiding pollution, and maintaining a good level of soil fertility. This sub-indicator addresses the first issue, while the second one is addressed under sub-indicator 4 &#x2018;Soil health&#x2019;. </p>\n<p><strong>Coverage: </strong>All farm types</p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong></p>\n<p>The proposed approach is based on questions to farmers about their use of fertilizer, in particular mineral or synthetic fertilizers and animal manure, their awareness about the environmental risks associated with fertilizer and manure applications, and their behaviour in terms of plant nutrient management<sup><a href=\"#footnote-9\" id=\"footnote-ref-9\">[8]</a></sup>.

Management of pesticides</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension: </strong>Environmental<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Theme: </strong>Pesticide risk</p>\n<p>Pesticides are important inputs in modern agriculture (crop and livestock), but if not well managed they can cause harm to people&#x2019;s health or to the environment.

Use of agro-biodiversity-supportive practices</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension: </strong>Environmental<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Theme: </strong>Biodiversity </p>\n<p>The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) stresses the close relationship between agriculture activities and biodiversity, considering three levels of biodiversity: genetic level diversity; agrobiodiversity at production system level; and ecosystem level (wild) biodiversity. The way agriculture is practiced influences all three levels. Attempts to develop indicators of biodiversity for agriculture systematically consider a large number of sub-indicators, with no universally agreed sustainability criteria. Considering these constraints, and the importance of addressing biodiversity in the construction of Indicator 2.4.1, it is proposed to develop a sub-indicator that captures the efforts towards more sustainable agriculture that better contributes to biodiversity, by identifying a limited list of practices that are conducive to biodiversity conservation.</p>\n<p><strong>Coverage: </strong>All farm types<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong></p>\n<p>This sub-indicator measures the level of adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices that better contribute to biodiversity by the farm at ecosystem, species and genetic levels. This indicator addresses both crops and livestock. Specifically, in case of this sub-indicator the scope is the entire area of the farm holding as opposed to the agricultural area that is used for rest of the 10 sub-indicators. </p>\n<p>In particular, two separate scoring systems depending on the applicability of the organic farming criterion have been proposed.</p>\n<p>Depending on whether organic certification system exists, countries will select one of the below two proposed set of criteria and thus will be evaluated/scored differently in terms of their sustainability status. According to this formulation, to secure green status, farms in countries with organic certification in place, will have to check 3 out of 6 criteria. On the contrary, farms operating in countries with no organic certification in place, will have to check 2 out of 5 criteria for obtaining the green status.</p>\n<p>The detailed formulation of the criteria for the 2 scoring systems is described below:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Criteria for group of countries with organic certification systems/schemes:</strong></li>\n  <li>Leaves at least 10% of the holding area for natural or diverse vegetation. This can include natural pasture/grassland, maintaining wildflower strips, stone and wood heaps, trees or hedgerows, natural ponds or wetlands. </li>\n  <li>Farm produces agricultural products that are organically certified, or its products are undergoing the certification process. </li>\n  <li>Farm does not use medically important antimicrobials as growth promoters.</li>\n  <li>At least two of the following contribute to farm production: 1) temporary crops, 2) pasture, 3) permanent crops, 4) trees on farm, 5) livestock or animal products, and 6) aquaculture.</li>\n  <li>Practices crop or crop/pasture rotation involving at least 2 crops or crops and pastures on at least 80% of the farm agriculture area (excluding permanent crops and permanent pastures) over a period of 3 years. In case of a 2-crop rotation, the 2 crops have to be from different plant genus, e.g. a grass plus a legume, or a grass plus a tuber etc.<strong> </strong></li>\n  <li>Livestock includes locally adapted breeds<sup><a href=\"#footnote-17\" id=\"footnote-ref-17\">[16]</a></sup>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Sustainability status:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Green (desirable): The agricultural holding meets at least three of the above criteria </li>\n      <li>Yellow (acceptable): The agricultural holding meets one or two of the above criteria</li>\n      <li>Red (unsustainable): The agricultural holding meets none of the above criteria</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Criteria for group of countries with no organic certification systems/schemes:</strong></li>\n  <li>Leaves at least 10% of the holding area for natural or diverse vegetation.

Wage rate in agriculture</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension: </strong>Social </p>\n<p><strong>Theme: </strong>Decent employment</p>\n<p>The theme provides information on the remuneration of employees working for the farm and belonging to the elementary occupation group, as defined by the International Standard Classification of Occupation (ISCO-08 - code 92). It informs about economic risks faced by unskilled workers (those performing simple and routine tasks) in terms of remuneration received, the later benchmarked against the minimum wage set at national level in the agricultural sector. This sub-indicator allows distinguishing between holdings that pay a fair remuneration to its employees under the elementary occupation group, and agricultural holdings paying a remuneration to their employees belonging to the elementary occupation group that is below the minimum wage standard.

The questions focus on self-reported food-related behaviors and experiences associated with increasing difficulties in accessing food due to resource constraints. </p>\n<p>The FIES is derived from two widely-used experience-based food security scales: the U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module and the Latin American and Caribbean Food Security Scale (Spanish acronym ELCSA). It consists of a set of eight short yes/no questions asked directly to people. The questions focus on self-reported, food-related behaviours and experiences associated with increasing difficulties in accessing food due to resource constraints. The FIES is based on a well-grounded construct of the experience of food insecurity composed of three domains: uncertainty/anxiety, changes in food quality, and changes in food quantity.</p>\n<p>This sub-indicator is SDG indicator 2.1.2, contextualised for a farm survey. </p>\n<p><strong>Sustainability criteria: </strong>Level on FIES scale</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Green (desirable): Mild food insecurity<sup><a href=\"#footnote-18\" id=\"footnote-ref-18\">[17]</a></sup> </li>\n  <li>Yellow (acceptable)<sup><a href=\"#footnote-19\" id=\"footnote-ref-19\">[18]</a></sup>: Moderate food insecurity </li>\n  <li>Red (unsustainable): Severe food insecurity </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Data items:</strong></p>\n<p>Reference period: last 12 months</p>\n<p>10.1 The respondent&#x2019;s recollection that he/she (or any other adult in the household) would be worried about not having enough food to eat due to lack of money or other resources</p>\n<p>10.2 The respondent&#x2019;s recollection that he/she (or any adult in the household) was unable to eat healthy and nutritious food because of lack of money or other resources</p>\n<p>10.3 The respondent&#x2019;s recollection that he/she (or any adult in the household) only ate a few kinds of food due to lack of money or other resources</p>\n<p>10.4 The respondent&#x2019;s recollection that he/she (or any adult in the household) had to skip a meal because there was no enough money or other resources for food</p>\n<p>10.5 The respondent&#x2019;s recollection that he/she (or any adult in the household) ate less than he/she thought he should due to lack of money or other resources</p>\n<p>10.6 The respondent&#x2019;s recollection that his/her household ran out of food because of a lack of money or other resources</p>\n<p>10.7 The respondent&#x2019;s recollection that he/she (or any adult in the household) was hungry but not eating due to lack of money or other resources for food</p>\n<p>10.8 The respondent&#x2019;s recollection that he/she (or any adult in the household) did not eat for a whole day because of a lack of money or other resources</p>\n<h3><strong>11. Secure tenure rights to land</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension: </strong>Social </p>\n<p><strong>Theme: </strong>Land tenure</p>\n<p>The sub-indicator allows assessing sustainability in terms of rights over use of agricultural land areas. Since agricultural land is a key input for agricultural production, having secure rights over land ensures that the agricultural holding controls such a key asset and does not risk losing the land used by the holding for farming. </p>\n<p>Evidence shows that farmers tend to be less productive if they have limited access to and control of economic resources and services, particularly land. Long-lasting inequalities of economic and financial resources have positioned certain farmers at a disadvantage relative to others in their ability to participate in, contribute to and benefit from broader processes of development. </p>\n<p>As such, adequate distribution of economic resources, particularly land, help ensure equitable economic growth, contributes to economic efficiency and has a positive impact on key development outcomes, including poverty reduction, food security and the welfare of households.</p>\n<p>This sub-indicator is SDG indicator 5.a.1, customised for SDG indicator 2.4.1. </p>\n<p><strong>Coverage: </strong>All farms types<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong></p>\n<p>The sub-indicator measures the ownership or secure rights over use of agricultural land areas using the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Formal document issued by the Land Registry/Cadastral Agency </li>\n  <li>Name of the holder listed as owner/use right holder on legally recognized documents</li>\n  <li>Rights to sell any of the parcel of the holding</li>\n  <li>Rights to bequeath any of the parcel of the holding</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sustainability criteria: </strong></p>\n<p>Level of security of access to land.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Green (desirable): has a formal document with the name of the holder/holding on it, or has the right to sell any of the parcel of the holding, or has the right to bequeath any of the parcel of the holding</li>\n  <li>Yellow (acceptable): has a formal document even if the name of the holder/holding is not on it</li>\n  <li>Red (unsustainable): no positive responses to any of the 4 questions above</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Data items:</strong></p>\n<p>Reference period: last calendar year</p>\n<p>11.1 Type of formal document for any of the agricultural land of the holder/holding that it holds (alternatively &#x2018;possess, use, occupy) issued by the Land Registry/Cadastral Agency</p>\n<p>&#x20DD; 1 Title deed</p>\n<p>&#x20DD; 2 Certificate of customary tenure</p>\n<p>&#x20DD; 3 Certificate of occupancy</p>\n<p>&#x20DD; 4 Registered will or registered certificate of hereditary acquisitions</p>\n<p>&#x20DD; 5 Registered certificate of perpetual / long term lease</p>\n<p>&#x20DD; 6 Registered rental contract</p>\n<p>&#x20DD; 7 Other</p>\n<p>11.2 Name of any member of the holding listed as an owner or use right holder on any of the legally recognized documents</p>\n<p>11.3 The right of the holder/holding to sell any of the parcel of the holding</p>\n<p>11.4 The right of the holder/holding to bequeath any of the parcel of the holding</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-3\">2</sup><p> According to the SEEA-AFF classification and the classification of the World Agricultural Census 2020 <a href=\"#footnote-ref-3\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-4\">3</sup><p> The 90<sup>th</sup> percentile and respective 1/3 and 2/3 thresholds for productivity are calculated by major production system (crops, livestock, or a mix of crops and livestock or if possible by major agricultural areas of the country).

Les considérations clés dans la sélection des thèmes sont la pertinence et la mesurabilité. En termes de pertinence, la relation entre le sous-indicateur associé et les résultats de l'agriculture durable au niveau de l'exploitation doit être forte. Suivant cette approche, seuls les sous-indicateurs qui répondent aux politiques au niveau des exploitations visant à améliorer l'agriculture durable sont pris en compte. En termes de mesurabilité, seul un ensemble de thèmes et de sous-indicateurs « de base » pour lesquels des mesures et des rapports sont attendus dans la majorité des pays sont sélectionnés</p>.\n<p>Un aspect essentiel de toutes les approches de la mesure de l'agriculture durable est la reconnaissance du fait que la durabilité est un concept multidimensionnel, et que ces multiples dimensions doivent être reflétées dans la construction de l'indicateur. Cela implique que l'indicateur 2.4.1 des ODD doit être basé sur un ensemble de sous-indicateurs qui couvrent ces trois dimensions.</p> <p>Grâce à un processus consultatif qui a duré plus de deux ans, 11 thèmes et sous-indicateurs ont été identifiés et constituent l'indicateur 2.4.1 des ODD.</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <h2>No.</h2>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <h2>Thèmes</h2>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <h2>Sous-indicateurs</h2>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>1</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Productivité des terres</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Valeur de production agricole par hectare</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>2</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Rentabilité</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Revenu net de la ferme</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>3</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Résilience</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Mécanismes d'atténuation de risques</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>4</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Santé des sols</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Prévalence de détérioration des sols</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>5</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Utilisation de l'eau</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Variation dans la disponibilité de l'eau</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>6</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Risque de pollution par les engrais</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Gestion des engrais</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>7</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Risque des pesticides</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Gestion des pesticides</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>8</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Biodiversité</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Utilisation de pratiques propices à l'agro-biodiversité</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>9</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Emploi décent</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Taux de rémunération en agriculture</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>10</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Sécurité alimentaire</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Échelle de sécurité alimentaire fondée sur l'expérience (FIES)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>11</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Régime foncier</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Droits fonciers sûrs</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Veuillez consulter l'annexe pour une description détaillée des sous-indicateurs.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-3\">1</sup><p>Les pays définiront les fermes d'agrément selon leurs critères nationaux et retireront ces exploitations de la population d'intérêt pour l'indicateur 2.4.1 jusqu'à ce qu'une définition internationale soit disponible. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-3\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div><p>L'indicateur est sans unité, exprimant un rapport entre deux superficies (toutes deux mesurées en milliers d'hectares), c'est-à-dire la superficie consacrée à l'agriculture durable et productive et la superficie totale des terres agricoles.</p><p>La classification des terres est celle du Recensement de l'agriculture et du Système des comptes économiques et environnementaux (SEEA), telle qu'elle est mise en œuvre dans le questionnaire de la FAO sur l'utilisation des terres, l'irrigation et les pratiques agricoles (<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/faostat/fr/#data/RL/metadata\">https://www.fao.org/faostat/fr/#data/RL/metadata</a> ). </p><p>Différentes données sont recueillies via différents instruments.

Ceci fournira des informations supplémentaires et aidera à vérifier la robustesse de l'indicateur 2.4.1 des ODD en ce qui concerne la dimension environnementale de la durabilité.</p><p>Un questionnaire est envoyé à tous les pays chaque année depuis 2020 (<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators/241/fr/\">https://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators/241/fr/</a> ). En outre, afin de faciliter la collecte de données par pays, un module de données a été conçu et il contient l’ensemble des questions de base nécessaires pour obtenir les données pour l’ODD 2.4.1. Si des enquêtes agricoles existent déjà dans un pays, ces questions peuvent être intégrées dans les instruments existants afin de réduire au minimum la charge de la collecte des données pesant sur les bureaux nationaux de statistique. </p>\n<p>Toutes les activités de collecte de données seront effectuées par l’intermédiaire du bureau national de statistique ou du bureau désigné pour recueillir des données pour cet indicateur. La FAO, en collaboration avec la Stratégie mondiale pour l’amélioration des statistiques agricoles et rurales (GSARS), a créé le matériel de renforcement des capacités nécessaire pour cet indicateur, y compris un guide méthodologique, un manuel de recenseur, un document de calcul et un cours d’apprentissage en ligne pour former les BNS des pays et d’autres membres du personnel concernés au sujet de cet indicateur. </p><p>La collecte des données dépendra des cycles de collecte de données existant actuellement pour les enquêtes agricoles dans les pays. La FAO a intégré le module de questionnaire associé à cet indicateur dans le programme AGRISurvey et l'initiative 50x2030.</p><p>Bien que de nouvelles données ne soient pas disponibles à chaque année pour chaque pays, toutes les nouvelles informations devraient être diffusées chaque année par l’intermédiaire de FAOSTAT. </p><p>Les bureaux nationaux de statistique ou les bureaux désignés dans les pays seront chargés de recueillir des données pour cet indicateur. </p><p>Les bureaux nationaux de statistique ou les bureaux désignés dans les pays seront chargés de recueillir et de compiler les données pour cet indicateur. Ils rendront compte à leur tour à la FAO qui assurera le renforcement des capacités, effectuera le contrôle de la qualité et diffusera l’information par l’intermédiaire de FAOSTAT. La FAO fera à son tour rapport à la communauté statistique internationale et à la DSNU. </p><p>L’article I de la constitution de la FAO exige que celle-ci recueille, analyse, interprète et diffuse des informations relatives à la nutrition, à l’alimentation et à l’agriculture <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/K8024F/K8024F.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/3/K8024F/K8024F.pdf</a> . </p><p>Les approches pour encadrer et définir l'agriculture durable varient en termes de couverture des trois dimensions principales de la durabilité, c'est-à-dire économique, environnementale et sociale, et en termes d'échelle utilisée pour évaluer la durabilité, c'est-à-dire à l'échelle du champ et de la ferme jusqu'aux échelles nationale et mondiale. Certaines approches prennent en compte différentes caractéristiques de la durabilité, par exemple si les pratiques actuelles sont économiquement réalisables, respectueuses de l'environnement et socialement souhaitables. D'autres approches se concentrent sur des pratiques particulières telles que l'agriculture biologique, régénérative ou à faibles intrants et peuvent les assimiler à une agriculture durable. </p>\n<p>La conclusion d'une revue de la littérature associée au développement méthodologique de cet indicateur est que l'approche multidimensionnelle développée par la FAO en 1988 est un cadre significatif du concept. Ainsi, l'agriculture durable peut être considérée comme « la gestion et la conservation de la base de ressources naturelles, et l'orientation du changement technologique et institutionnel de manière à assurer la réalisation et la satisfaction continue des besoins humains des générations présentes et futures. Un tel développement (dans l'agriculture, la foresterie et la pêche, etc.) préserve la terre, l'eau, les ressources génétiques végétales et animales, sans dégradation de l'environnement et est techniquement approprié, économiquement viable et socialement acceptable. » (FAO, 1988)</p><p>Au cours des consultations entreprises, plusieurs pays ont souligné les difficultés à combiner des données provenant de différentes sources et ont demandé que cela soit évité dans la mesure du possible. D'autres pays, relativement riches en données, ont au contraire insisté sur la nécessité de permettre l'utilisation des sources de données existantes. La méthodologie actualisée répond à ces deux préoccupations : elle propose l'enquête agricole comme instrument unique de collecte de données pour tous les sous-indicateurs, mais elle offre également la possibilité d'utiliser une combinaison de différentes sources de données comme option alternative, pour autant que certains critères soient satisfaits</p>.\n<p>La décision d'utiliser l'enquête agricole comme instrument de collecte de données pour cet indicateur est conforme aux efforts des pays, soutenus par la FAO, pour développer les enquêtes agricoles comme l'outil le plus approprié pour générer des statistiques agricoles. Il bénéficie également des travaux de la FAO visant à développer le programme d'enquête intégrée sur l'agriculture (AGRIS), qui est mis en œuvre dans le cadre d'une nouvelle initiative appelée <a href=\"http://www.data4sdgs.org/50by2030\">50x2030</a> (lien en anglais seulement). </p>\n<p>La décision de se concentrer sur les enquêtes agricoles a des implications sur le type d'informations qu'il est possible de saisir afin de couvrir les différentes dimensions de la durabilité. Si les enquêtes agricoles sont bien adaptées pour mesurer la dimension économique de la durabilité, elles ne sont peut-être pas l'outil idéal pour mesurer la durabilité environnementale et sociale en termes d'impact/résultats. </p>\n<p>Généralement, les impacts environnementaux de l'agriculture sont mesurés par des systèmes de surveillance tels que la télédétection, l'échantillonnage du sol et de l'eau, ou d'autres outils associés à une zone spécifique, plutôt qu'à une seule exploitation agricole. Pour plusieurs thèmes environnementaux, il est peu probable que les agriculteurs soient en mesure d'évaluer l'impact environnemental de leurs pratiques agricoles sur des questions telles que la pollution par les engrais ou l'impact des pesticides. L'utilisation d'un instrument d'enquête agricole, au lieu de systèmes de surveillance environnementale, implique donc de passer de la mesure des résultats/impacts à l'évaluation des pratiques des agriculteurs. Dans la mesure du possible, cependant, la méthodologie révisée continue de se concentrer sur la mesure des résultats. </p>\n<p>De même, les sous-thèmes de la dimension sociale sont généralement mieux saisis par des enquêtes auprès des ménages. Si, dans la majorité des cas, les exploitations agricoles sont étroitement associées à un ménage donné, ce n'est pas toujours le cas, et par conséquent, la saisie de la dimension sociale de la durabilité par le biais d'une enquête agricole, en particulier si elle n'est pas conçue pour couvrir les aspects sociaux, pourrait poser certains défis.</p><p>Les étapes de calcul de l'ODD 2.4.1 incluent :</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Déterminer la <strong>portée </strong>de l'indicateur : la portée de l'indicateur 2.4.1 est l'exploitation agricole, et plus précisément la superficie agricole de l'exploitation, c'est-à-dire les terres utilisées principalement pour les cultures et élever du bétail. Les activités de foresterie, de pêche et d'aquaculture peuvent être incluses dans la mesure où il s'agit d'activités secondaires menées sur la surface agricole de l'exploitation, par exemple la rizipisciculture et les systèmes similaires.</li>\n  <li>Déterminer les <strong>dimensions </strong>à couvrir : l'indicateur 2.4.1 inclut les dimensions environnementales, économiques et sociales dans l'évaluation de la durabilité. </li>\n  <li>Choisir <strong>l'échelle </strong>pour l'évaluation de la durabilité : l'indicateur 2.4.1 est au niveau de l'exploitation avec une agrégation à des niveaux supérieurs.</li>\n  <li>Choisir le ou les <strong>instruments </strong>de collecte de données. Il est recommandé que les données de l'indicateur 2.4.1 soient recueillies via une enquête agricole.</li>\n  <li>Choisir les <strong>thèmes </strong>au sein de chaque dimension, et choisir un <strong>sous-indicateur </strong>pour chaque thème. Les sous-indicateurs doivent satisfaire à un certain nombre de critères (décrits à l'annexe 1 pour chaque sous-indicateur, respectivement).</li>\n  <li>Évaluer la <strong>performance de durabilité au niveau de l'exploitation pour chaque sous-indicateur</strong> : des <strong>critères </strong>de durabilité spécifiques sont appliqués afin d'évaluer le niveau de durabilité de l'exploitation pour chaque thème en fonction des sous-indicateurs. </li>\n  <li>Décider de la <strong>périodicité de suivi de l'indicateur</strong>. Il est recommandé que la collecte soit au moins tous les trois ans.</li>\n  <li><strong>Modalité de déclaration de l'indicateur</strong>. L'ensemble des sous-indicateurs est présenté sous la forme d'un <strong>tableau de bord</strong>. L'approche du tableau de bord offre une réponse en termes de mesure de la durabilité au niveau de l'exploitation et de son agrégation au niveau national. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>La méthodologie propose de rendre compte de l'indicateur 2.4.1 à travers un tableau de bord au niveau national, présentant les différents sous-indicateurs ensemble mais de façon indépendante. L'approche du tableau de bord offre plusieurs avantages, notamment la possibilité de combiner des données provenant de différentes sources et l'identification des problèmes critiques de durabilité, facilitant la recherche d'un équilibre entre les trois dimensions de la durabilité. En conséquence, les pays peuvent facilement visualiser leurs performances en termes de différentes dimensions et thèmes de durabilité, et comprendre où les efforts politiques peuvent être concentrés pour des améliorations futures.</p>\n<p>Le calcul des résultats et la construction du tableau de bord sont effectués pour chaque sous-indicateur séparément en utilisant l'approche du « feu de circultation » déjà définie pour chaque sous-indicateur : l'agrégation au niveau national est effectuée pour chaque sous-indicateur indépendamment , en additionnant la superficie des terres agricoles de chaque exploitation agricole par catégorie de durabilité (rouge, jaune ou vert) et en rapportant le total national résultant en pourcentage de la superficie nationale totale des terres agricoles de toutes les exploitations agricoles du pays. En pratique, la valeur déclarée de l'indicateur 2.4.1 est déterminée par les résultats du sous-indicateur le plus limitatif en termes de performance de durabilité.</p><p>Les données font l’objet d’un travail de validation complet qui couvre : la détection des valeurs aberrantes, les erreurs de transmission et les contrôles de cohérence des données. On invite les pays à examiner les résultats diffusés pour leur pays et soit à confirmer qu’ils sont corrects, soit à fournir des remarques et / ou à réviser les données s’ils identifient des erreurs. </p><p>Des ajustements à la superficie agricole nationale totale peuvent être effectués pour corriger les zones communes qui sont hors de portée en ce qui concerne la méthodologie de l'indicateur.</p><p>La non-réponse partielle au niveau individuel (exploitation agricole) sera imputée à l'aide de techniques statistiques appropriées, telles que les algorithmes du plus proche voisin. La décision d'imputer ou non et le choix de la méthode sont fonction de la nature de la variable à imputer et de la quantité et du type de données disponibles pour l'imputation, telles que la disponibilité de données auxiliaires provenant de différentes sources (par ex. enquêtes, informations administratives). </p>\n<p>Il est important de distinguer clairement les données manquantes des événements non applicables. Comme précisé ci-dessus et dans les fiches méthodologiques des sous-indicateurs, certains sous-indicateurs peuvent être enregistrés comme « sans objet » pour une exploitation donnée. Dans ce cas, l'exploitation sera considérée comme durable du point de vue des sous-indicateurs donnés.</p>\n<p>&#x2022; <strong>Au niveau national :</strong></p>\n<p>&#x2022; <strong>Aux niveaux régional et mondial :</strong></p><p>Ces données seront diffusées par l’intermédiaire de FAOSTAT, la plus grande base de données de statistiques alimentaires et agricoles. Par conséquent, la méthode de calcul suivra la norme internationale établie par la base de données. Dans le cas de cet indicateur, les agrégats régionaux et mondiaux seront calculés en pondérant les indicateurs nationaux en fonction de la superficie agricole du pays.</p><p>La note méthodologique

Valeur de la production agricole par hectare</h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension : </strong>économique</p>\n<p><strong>Thème : </strong>productivité des terres</p>\n<p>La productivité des terres est une mesure de la valeur agricole des productions obtenues sur une superficie donnée. Le maintien ou l’amélioration de la production au fil du temps par rapport à la superficie des terres utilisées est un aspect important de la durabilité pour diverses raisons. Au niveau de l’exploitation, la productivité des terres reflète la technologie et les processus de production pour des conditions agro-écologiques données. Dans un sens plus large, une augmentation du niveau de productivité des terres permet une production plus élevée tout en réduisant la pression sur les ressources foncières de plus en plus rares, généralement liées à la déforestation et aux pertes associées de services écosystémiques et de biodiversité.</p>\n<p><strong>Couverture : </strong>tous les types d'exploitations agricoles</p>\n<p><strong>Description : </strong></p>\n<p>Le sous-indicateur est décrit comme la valeur de la production agricole par hectare (exploitations qui produisent des cultures et du bétail ou un mélange).

Revenu agricole net</h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension :</strong> économique</p>\n<p> <strong>Thème :</strong> rentabilité</p>\n<p>Une partie importante de la durabilité de l’agriculture est la viabilité économique de l’exploitation, tirée dans une large mesure par sa rentabilité. La rentabilité est mesurée à l’aide du revenu net que l’agriculteur est en mesure de tirer des opérations agricoles. La disponibilité et l’utilisation de l’information sur la performance économique des exploitations agricoles, mesurée à l’aide de la rentabilité, favoriseront une meilleure prise de décision tant au niveau microéconomique que macro-économique. Étant donné que les mesures du rendement déterminent le comportement, une meilleure information sur le rendement peut modifier le comportement et la prise de décisions du gouvernement et des producteurs, tant dans l'agriculture commerciale à grande échelle que dans l'agriculture de subsistance à petite et moyenne échelle.</li>\n<p><strong>Couverture : </strong>tous les types d'exploitations agricoles</p>\n<p><strong>Description : </strong></p>\n<p>Le sous-indicateur mesure si l'exploitation est constamment rentable sur une période de trois ans.

Ses principales composantes comprennent les recettes monétaires provenant de la vente de produits agricoles, les paiements directs de programmes aux producteurs, les autres revenus agricoles (tels que les revenus du travail à forfait), la valeur des aliments et du carburant produits et consommés sur la même exploitation, et la variation de la valeur des stocks de fin d'année des cultures et du bétail<sup><a href=\"#footnote-7\" id=\"footnote-ref-7\">[5]</a></sup>.</li>\n  <li>Les recettes monétaires agricoles comprennent les recettes provenant de la vente de produits agricoles en unités monétaires locales qui incluent les ventes de cultures, de bétail et de ses sous-produits.</li>\n  <li>Les paiements directs de programmes aux producteurs inclus dans les recettes monétaires agricoles représentent les montants versés dans le cadre de divers programmes gouvernementaux et privés aux personnes impliquées dans la production agricole. Les paiements liés à la production agricole courante comprennent les subventions visant à encourager la production ou à compenser les producteurs pour les faibles rendements du marché, les paiements visant à stabiliser les revenus et les paiements visant à compenser les producteurs pour les pertes de récoltes ou de bétail causées par des conditions climatiques extrêmes, des maladies ou d'autres raisons et les paiements d'assurance.</li>\n  <li>Le revenu en nature mesure la valeur des biens agricoles produits dans les exploitations agricoles et consommés par les familles des exploitants agricoles. Il est inclus pour mesurer la production agricole totale.</li>\n  <li>Les dépenses d'exploitation représentent les coûts commerciaux encourus par les entreprises agricoles pour les biens et services utilisés dans le processus de production. Les dépenses comprennent à la fois les achats et la propre production, à savoir : les impôts fonciers, le travail à forfait, les semences, le loyer, les engrais et la chaux, les produits chimiques, les réparations des machines et des bâtiments, l'irrigation, le carburant pour le chauffage et les machines, les salaires, les intérêts et la part de l'entreprise dans les primes d'assurance.</li>\n  <li>Les charges d'amortissement tiennent compte de la dépréciation économique ou de la perte de la juste valeur marchande des immobilisations de l'entreprise agricole. Calculée sur les bâtiments agricoles, les machines agricoles et la part de l'entreprise agricole dans les automobiles, les camions et la maison de ferme, la dépréciation est généralement considérée comme le résultat du vieillissement, de l'usure et de l'obsolescence. Elle représente une diminution des avantages économiques potentiels qui peuvent être générés par l'immobilisation.</li>\n  <li>La valeur de la variation des stocks (VVS) mesure la valeur monétaire de la variation physique des stocks appartenant aux producteurs. Ce concept est utilisé pour évaluer la production économique agricole totale. Pour calculer la VIC, la variation des stocks appartenant aux producteurs (entre la fin et le début d'une année civile) est d'abord calculée, puis multipliée par les prix annuels moyens des cultures ou la valeur par animal. Ce calcul est différent de l'approche de la valeur comptable financière ou comptable, qui évalue les stocks de début et de fin, puis en déduit la variation.</li>\n  <li>La VVS pour tous les principaux produits de base peut varier considérablement (en fonction de l'ampleur de la variation des stocks et des prix). La VVS peut être positive (lorsque les stocks sont plus importants à la fin de l'année par rapport aux niveaux du début de l'année) ou négative (lorsque les stocks de fin d'année sont inférieurs aux niveaux du début de l'année). Si les niveaux de stocks sont les mêmes au début et à la fin de l'année, la VVS sera nulle malgré les variations de prix.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>L'estimation de la rentabilité au niveau d'une exploitation agricole nécessite généralement la compilation des registres financiers de base de l'exploitation, c'est-à-dire les transactions quotidiennes, hebdomadaires, mensuelles ou saisonnières de manière organisée. En général, les grandes exploitations commerciales tiennent des registres financiers détaillés, mais dans le cas des exploitations d'agriculture de subsistance à moyenne et petite échelle, la tenue de registres est rarement pratiquée et dans la plupart des pays, elle n'existe pas du tout.</p>\n<p>Dans le cas où des données détaillées ne sont pas disponibles au niveau de l'exploitation, les estimations seront calculées sur la base des déclarations des agriculteurs concernant les quantités et les prix des produits et des intrants. Dans ces cas, la dépréciation, la variation des stocks et les taxes peuvent être négligées.

Prévalence de détérioration des sols</h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension : </strong>environnementale</p>\n<p><strong>Thème : </strong>santé des sols </p>\n<p>De nombreux processus affectant la santé des sols sont déterminés par les pratiques agricoles. La FAO et le Groupe technique intergouvernemental sur les sols (ITPS) ont identifié 10 menaces principales pour les fonctions du sol : érosion du sol, pertes de carbone organique du sol, déséquilibre des nutriments, acidification, contamination, engorgement, compactage, imperméabilisation du sol, salinisation et perte de biodiversité du sol. </p>\n<p><strong>Couverture : </strong>tous les types d'exploitations agricoles </p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong></p>\n<p>Ce sous-indicateur mesure la mesure dans laquelle les activités agricoles affectent la santé des sols et représente donc un problème de durabilité. L'examen des dix menaces pesant sur les sols montre que toutes sauf une (l'imperméabilisation des sols, qui est la perte de sols naturels au profit de la construction/urbanisation) sont potentiellement et principalement affectées par des pratiques agricoles inappropriées. Dans l'idéal, il faudrait donc que tous les sols situés sous la surface agricole d'un pays fassent l'objet d'une surveillance périodique afin d'évaluer l'impact de l'agriculture sur les sols. Cela nécessite des enquêtes et des campagnes d'échantillonnage détaillées, associées à des tests en laboratoire. Afin de proposer une solution gérable tout en capturant les principales tendances du pays en termes de santé des sols, l'enquête agricole se concentre sur les quatre menaces qui combinent les caractéristiques les plus répandues (pour la surveillance nationale, les pays peuvent choisir d'ajouter l'un des autres domaines indiqués ci-dessus, en fonction de la pertinence), et les plus faciles à évaluer par le biais des enquêtes agricoles :</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Érosion des sols</li>\n  <li>Réduction de la fertilité du sol</li>\n  <li>Salinisation des terres irriguées</li>\n  <li>Engorgement</li>\n  <li>Autre – Précisez </li>\n</ol>\n<p>L'enquête agricole permet de saisir les connaissances des agriculteurs sur la situation de l'exploitation agricole en termes de dégradation des sols. L'expérience a montré que les agriculteurs sont très conscients de l'état de leurs sols, de leur santé et de leur niveau de dégradation. Les agriculteurs peuvent également avoir l'opportunité de mentionner d'autres menaces que les quatre ci-dessus.</p>\n<p>D'autres sources de données sur la santé des sols peuvent soit compléter les informations collectées par l'enquête agricole et offrir des possibilités de recoupement des réponses des agriculteurs, soit être utilisées comme sources alternatives de données. Avant l'enquête agricole, une étude documentaire pourrait recueillir toutes les informations disponibles sur la santé des sols, notamment en utilisant les statistiques officielles nationales ou les statistiques disponibles auprès d'agences internationales telles que la FAO. Il s'agit généralement de cartes, de modèles, de résultats d'échantillonnage des sols, d'analyses en laboratoire et d'enquêtes sur le terrain, ainsi que de tous les rapports existants sur la détérioration des sols et des terres au niveau national. Sur la base de ces informations, des cartes ou des tableaux (selon les frontières administratives ou d'autres divisions du pays) peuvent être établis, montrant les menaces pesant sur les sols selon les 4 catégories de menaces ci-dessus.</p>\n<p><strong>Critères de durabilité : </strong></p>\n<p>Proportion de la surface agricole de l'exploitation affectée par la détérioration des sols.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Vert (souhaitable) : La superficie combinée affectée par l'une des quatre menaces sélectionnées pour la santé des sols est négligeable (moins de 10% de la surface agricole totale de l'exploitation).</li>\n  <li>Jaune (acceptable) : La superficie combinée affectée par l'une des quatre menaces sélectionnées pour la santé des sols se situe entre 10 % et 50 % de la superficie agricole totale de l'exploitation.</li>\n  <li>Rouge (non durable) : La superficie combinée affectée par l'une des quatre menaces sélectionnées pour la santé des sols est supérieure à 50 % de la superficie agricole totale de l'exploitation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Éléments de données :</strong></p>\n<p>Période de référence : trois dernières années civiles</p>\n<p>4.1 Liste des menaces de détérioration des sols subies par l'exploitation</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Érosion du sol (perte de la couche arable par érosion éolienne ou hydrique)</li>\n  <li>Réduction de la fertilité des sols<sup><a href=\"#footnote-9\" id=\"footnote-ref-9\">[7]</a></sup></li>\n  <li>Salinisation des terres irriguées</li>\n  <li>Engorgement</li>\n  <li>Autre – Précisez</li>\n  <li>Aucun des éléments ci-dessus</li>\n</ol>\n<p>4.2 Surface totale de l'exploitation affectée par des menaces liées à la dégradation du sol</p>\n<h3>5. Variation de la disponibilité en eau </h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension : </strong>environnementale </p>\n <p><strong>Thème : </strong>utilisation de l'eau </p>\n<p>L'agriculture, et plus particulièrement l'agriculture irriguée, est de loin le principal secteur économique utilisant les ressources en eau douce. Dans de nombreux endroits, le prélèvement d'eau dans les rivières et les aquifères souterrains dépasse ce qui peut être considéré comme écologiquement durable. Cette situation affecte à la fois les rivières et les aquifères souterrains. L'agriculture durable exige donc que ce niveau d'utilisation de l'eau douce pour l'irrigation reste dans des limites acceptables. Bien qu'il n'existe pas de normes internationalement reconnues en matière d'utilisation durable de l'eau, les signaux associés à une utilisation non durable de l'eau comprennent généralement la réduction progressive du niveau des eaux souterraines, l'assèchement des sources et des rivières, l'augmentation des conflits entre les utilisateurs d'eau.</p>\n<p><strong>Couverture : </strong>tous les types d'exploitations agricoles</p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong></p>\n<p>Ce sous-indicateur saisit la mesure dans laquelle l'agriculture contribue à des modèles non durables d'utilisation de l'eau. Idéalement, le niveau de durabilité de l'utilisation de l'eau est mesuré à l'échelle du bassin fluvial ou de l'aquifère d'eau souterraine, car c'est l'effet combiné de tous les utilisateurs partageant la même ressource qui a un impact sur la durabilité de l'eau. L'enquête agricole saisit la conscience et le comportement des agriculteurs par rapport à la pénurie d'eau, et les associe à trois niveaux de durabilité. Cette prise de conscience et ce comportement sont exprimés en termes de :</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>si l'agriculteur utilise l'eau pour irriguer les cultures sur au moins 10% de la surperficie agricole de l'exploitation et pourquoi, si la réponse est négative (n'en a pas besoin, ne peut se le permettre);</li>\n  <li>si l'agriculteur est conscient des problèmes de disponibilité de l'eau dans la zone de l'exploitation et s'il remarque une réduction de la disponibilité de l'eau au fil du temps;</li>\n  <li>s'il existe des organisations (organisations d'utilisateurs d'eau, autres) chargées de répartir l'eau entre les utilisateurs et dans quelle mesure ces organisations fonctionnent efficacement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>D'autres sources de données peuvent soit compléter l'enquête agricole à propos de l'utilisation de l'eau et offrir des possibilités de recoupement des réponses des agriculteurs, soit être utilisées comme sources alternatives de données. Avant l'enquête agricole, une étude documentaire doit recueillir toutes les informations disponibles sur le bilan hydrique, y compris les statistiques officielles nationales ou les statistiques disponibles auprès d'agences internationales telles que la FAO. Les informations sur les ressources en eau et leur utilisation sont généralement recueillies par les entités chargées de la gestion ou de la surveillance de l'eau et sont organisées par entité hydrologique (bassin fluvial ou aquifère souterrain). Elles comprennent généralement des relevés hydrologiques (débit des cours d'eau, niveaux des eaux souterraines), des modèles et des cartes montrant l'étendue de l'utilisation de l'eau par entité hydrologique.</p>\n<p><strong>Critères de durabilité : </strong></p>\n<p>La durabilité de l'exploitation agricole par rapport à l'utilisation de l'eau sera évaluée comme suit : </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Vert (souhaitable) : la disponibilité de l'eau reste stable au fil des ans, pour les exploitations irriguant des cultures sur plus de 10 % de la surperficie agricole de l'exploitation.

Gestion des engrais</h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension : </strong>environnementale</p>\n<p><strong>Thème : </strong>risque de pollution par les engrais</p>\n<p>L'agriculture peut affecter la qualité de l'environnement par une utilisation excessive ou une gestion inadéquate des engrais. L'agriculture durable implique que le niveau des produits chimiques dans le sol et dans les masses d'eau reste dans des seuils acceptables. La gestion intégrée des nutriments végétaux prend en compte toutes les sources de nutriments (minéraux et organiques) et leur gestion afin d'obtenir le meilleur équilibre nutritif. La mesure de la qualité des sols et de l'eau permet de connaître l'étendue et les causes de la pollution, mais la mise en place de systèmes de surveillance des sols et de l'eau est coûteuse et n'est pas toujours réalisable dans les pays. </p>\n<p>Note : la gestion des éléments nutritifs des plantes aborde deux questions de durabilité : éviter la pollution et maintenir un bon niveau de fertilité des sols. Ce sous-indicateur traite de la première question, tandis que la seconde est traitée dans le sous-indicateur 4 « Santé des sols ». </p>\n<p><strong>Couverture : </strong>tous les types d'exploitations agricoles</p>\n<p><strong>Description : </strong></p>\n<p>L'approche proposée est basée sur des questions posées aux agriculteurs concernant leur utilisation d'engrais, en particulier d'engrais minéraux ou synthétiques et de fumier animal, leur connaissance des risques environnementaux associés aux applications d'engrais et de fumier, et leur comportement en termes de gestion des éléments nutritifs des plantes<sup><a href=\"#footnote-10\" id=\"footnote-ref-10\">[8]</a></sup>.

Utilisation de pratiques propices à l'agro-biodiversité </h3>\n<p><strong>Dimension : </strong>environnementale</p>\n<p><strong>Thème : </strong>biodiversité </p>\n<p>La Convention sur la diversité biologique (CDB) souligne la relation étroite entre les activités agricoles et la biodiversité, en considérant trois niveaux de biodiversité : la diversité au niveau génétique; l'agrobiodiversité au niveau du système de production; et la biodiversité au niveau de l'écosystème (sauvage). La façon dont l'agriculture est pratiquée influence ces trois niveaux. Les tentatives de développement d'indicateurs de biodiversité pour l'agriculture considèrent systématiquement un grand nombre de sous-indicateurs, sans critères de durabilité universellement reconnus. Compte tenu de ces contraintes, et de l'importance d'aborder la biodiversité dans la construction de l'indicateur 2.4.1, il est proposé de développer un sous-indicateur qui reflète les efforts vers une agriculture plus durable qui contribue mieux à la biodiversité, en identifiant une liste limitée de pratiques qui sont favorables à la conservation de la biodiversité.</p>\n<p><strong>Couverture : </strong>tous les types d'exploitations agricoles</p>\n<p><strong>Description : </strong></p>\n<p>Ce sous-indicateur mesure le niveau d'adoption de pratiques agricoles plus durables qui contribuent davantage à la biodiversité de l'exploitation aux niveaux de l'écosystème, des espèces et de la génétique. Cet indicateur concerne à la fois les cultures et le bétail. Plus précisément, dans le cas de ce sous-indicateur, le champ d'application est l'ensemble de la zone de l'exploitation agricole, par opposition à la zone agricole qui est utilisée pour les 10 autres sous-indicateurs. </p>\n<p>En particulier, deux systèmes de notation distincts en fonction de l'applicabilité du critère de l'agriculture biologique ont été proposés.</p>\n<p>Selon l'existence ou non d'un système de certification biologique, les pays choisiront l'un des deux ensembles de critères proposés ci-dessous et seront donc évalués/notés différemment en termes de leur statut de durabilité. Selon cette formulation, pour obtenir le statut vert, les exploitations des pays ayant mis en place une certification biologique devront satisfaire 3 des 6 critères. Au contraire, les exploitations opérant dans des pays où aucune certification biologique n'est en place, devront satisfaire 2 des 5 critères pour obtenir le statut vert.</p>\n<p>La formulation détaillée des critères pour les 2 systèmes de notation est décrite ci-dessous :</p>\n<p><strong>Critères pour le groupe de pays ayant des systèmes de certification biologique :</strong></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>L'exploitation laisse au moins 10% de sa superficie agricole à la végétation naturelle ou diversifiée.

Ce sous-indicateur permet de distinguer les exploitations qui versent une rémunération équitable à leurs employés appartenant au groupe des professions élémentaires et celles qui leur versent une rémunération inférieure à la norme du salaire minimum. Dans ce dernier cas, les exploitations agricoles sont considérées comme non viables car la rémunération versée n'est pas suffisante pour assurer un niveau de vie décent. </p>\n<p><strong>Couverture : </strong>ne s'applique pas aux exploitations qui n'emploient que de la main-d'œuvre familiale.</p>\n<p><strong>Description :</strong></p>\n<p>Le sous-indicateur mesure le taux de salaire journalier de la main d'oeuvre non qualifiée de l'exploitation agricole en unités monétaires locales (UML). <p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi>T</mi>\n    <mi>a</mi>\n    <mi>u</mi>\n    <mi>x</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>p</mi>\n    <mi>a</mi>\n    <mi>r</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>j</mi>\n    <mi>o</mi>\n    <mi>u</mi>\n    <mi>r</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>t</mi>\n    <mi>r</mi>\n    <mi>a</mi>\n    <mi>v</mi>\n    <mi>a</mi>\n    <mi>i</mi>\n    <mi>l</mi>\n    <mi>l</mi>\n    <mi>e</mi>\n    <mi>u</mi>\n    <mi>r</mi>\n    <mi>s</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>o</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>q</mi>\n    <mi>u</mi>\n    <mi>a</mi>\n    <mi>l</mi>\n    <mi>i</mi>\n    <mi>f</mi>\n    <mi>i</mi>\n    <mi>é</mi>\n    <mi>s</mi>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>C</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>m</mi>\n        <mi>p</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>T</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>h</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>v</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>é</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n    <mi>*</mi>\n    <mn>8</mn>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>h</mi>\n    <mi>e</mi>\n    <mi>u</mi>\n    <mi>r</mi>\n    <mi>e</mi>\n    <mi>s</mi>\n  </math></p>\n<p>où la compensation est à la fois monétaire et en nature et exprimée en unités monétaires locales (UML)</p>\n<p><strong>Critères de durabilité :</strong></p>\n<p>La taux de rémunération de la main-d'œuvre non qualifiée par rapport salaire minimum national ou du secteur agricole.
