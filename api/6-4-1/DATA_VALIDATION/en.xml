	<message>The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 6-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data validation is done in a number of steps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the AQUASTAT questionnaire embeds automatic validation rules to allow National Correspondents to identify any data consistency errors while compiling the data. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Once the questionnaire is submitted, FAO thoroughly reviews the information reported, using the following tools:&lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Manual cross-variable check. This includes cross-comparison with similar countries as well as historic data for the countries. &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Time-series coherency by running an R-script to compare reported data with those corresponding to previous years&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verification of the metadata, in particular the source of the proposed data. The critical analysis of the compiled data gives preference to national sources and expert knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After this verification, exchanges between the National Correspondents and FAO takes place to correct and confirm the collected data. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The last validation step is an automated validation routine included in the Statistical Working System (SWS), which uses almost 200 validation rules. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</data>
