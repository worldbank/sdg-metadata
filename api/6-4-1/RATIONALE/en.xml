	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 6-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The rationale behind this indicator consists in providing information on the efficiency of the economic and social usage of water resources, i.e., value added generated by the use of water in the main sectors of the economy, and distribution network losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distribution efficiency of water systems is implicit within the calculations and could be made explicit if needed and where data are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator addresses specifically the target component &amp;#x201C;substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors&amp;#x201D;, by measuring the output per unit of water from productive uses of water as well as losses in municipal water use. It does not aim at giving an exhaustive picture of the water utilization in a country. Other indicators, specifically those for Targets 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 5.4, 5.a, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5 will complement the information provided by this indicator. In particular, the indicator needs to be combined with the water stress indicator 6.4.2 to provide adequate follow-up of the target 6.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, the three sectoral efficiencies provide a measure of overall water efficiency in a country. The indicator provides incentives to improve water use efficiency through all sectors, highlighting those sectors where water use efficiency is lagging behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interpretation of the indicator would be enhanced by the utilization of supplementary indicators to be used at country level. Particularly important in this sense would be the indicator on efficiency of water for energy and the indicator on the efficiency of the municipality distribution networks.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
