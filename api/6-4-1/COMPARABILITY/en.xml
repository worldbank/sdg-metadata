	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 6-4-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Geographical: Regional differences, in particular in relation to irrigated agriculture and different climatic conditions (including variability) are to be considered in the interpretation of this indicator, especially in countries with substantial amounts of available water resources. Also for this reason, coupling this indicator with water stress (6.4.2) is important for the interpretation of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over-time: time series are comparable across time. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
