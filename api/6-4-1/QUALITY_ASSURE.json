The FAO Statistics Quality Assurance Framework (SQAF), available at: http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3664e/i3664e.pdf, provides the necessary principles, guidelines and tools to carry out quality assessments. FAO is performing an internal bi-annual survey (FAO Quality Assessment and Planning Survey) designed to gather information on all of FAO&#x2019;s statistical activities, notably to assess the extent to which quality standards are being implemented with a view to increasing compliance with the quality dimensions of SQAF, documenting best practices and prepare quality improvement plans, where necessary. Domain-specific quality assurance activities are carried out systematically (e.g. quality reviews, self-assessments, compliance monitoring).</p>","es":"<h2>Garantía de calidad:</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>NA</li>\n</ul>","fr":"<h2> Assurance de la qualité:</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li> NA</li>\n</ul>","pt":"","ru":"<h2> Обеспечение качества: </h2>\n<ul>\n  <li> Не применимо </li>\n</ul>"}}
