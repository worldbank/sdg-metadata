	<message>The STAT_CONC_DEF field for indicator 2-b-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agricultural export subsidies are defined as export subsidies budgetary outlays and quantities as notified by WTO Members in Tables ES:1 and supporting Tables ES:2 (following templates in document G/AG/2 dated 30 June 1995).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; Notifications by WTO Members with export subsidy reduction commitments included in part IV of their Schedules;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; Notifications of export subsidies by developing country Members pursuant to the provisions of article 9.4 of the Agreement on Agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other WTO Members are not entitled to use export subsidies and their notifications are therefore not recorded in the indicator series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budgetary outlays and quantities are expressed in a currency (national or other) and in quantity units as per Member&amp;apos;s notification practices. For Members with export subsidy reduction commitments included in part IV of their Schedules, the currency used in the notifications is similar to the one used in the Schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data are available by country and by products or groups of products, according to Members&amp;apos; schedules for Members with export subsidy reduction commitments included in part IV of their Schedules and according to Member&amp;apos;s notification practices in the case of developing country Members using export subsidies under the provisions of article 9.4 of the Agreement on Agriculture.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</data>
