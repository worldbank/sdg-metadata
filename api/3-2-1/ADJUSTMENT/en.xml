	<message>The ADJUSTMENT field for indicator 3-2-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Direct estimates from survey data are adjusted in high prevalence HIV settings for under-reporting of under-five mortality due to &amp;#x2018;missing mothers,&amp;#x2019; i.e. women who have died from HIV/AIDS and cannot report on the mortality experience of their children. Furthermore, UN IGME estimates are also adjusted to capture rapidly changing mortality rates due to HIV/AIDS and crises/disasters that are not well captured in survey data. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
