UNICEF also collects data through UNICEF country offices by reaching national counterpart(s). The UN IGME also collects vital registration data reported by Ministries of Health or other relevant agencies to WHO. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To increase the transparency of the estimation process, the UN IGME has developed a child mortality web portal, https://childmortality.org/, which includes all available data and shows estimates for each country.
