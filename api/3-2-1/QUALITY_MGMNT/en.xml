	<data>&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) applies a standard estimation method across all countries in the interest of comparability. This method aims to estimate a smooth trend curve of age-specific mortality rates, accounting for potential outliers and biases in data sources and averaging over the possibly many disparate data sources for a country. A more detailed descripition of the different phases of the statistical production process is available in the annual UN IGME report and at &lt;a href=&quot;https://childmortality.org/methods&quot;&gt;https://childmortality.org/methods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
