This indicator includes 8 domains. Each domain is scored on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means none of the requested mechanisms are implemented, 10 means all the requested mechanisms are in place. The percentage of points out of the total 80 points is then computed for each country. It is recommended that Governments convene a stakeholder group for self-scoring. The below table is used for scoring.
