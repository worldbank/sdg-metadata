	<data>&lt;p&gt;There are many mechanisms that could be useful to assess at the national level which would be relevant to enhance policy coherence for sustainable development. This methodology aims to provide a basis for countries to engage in discussions around what policy coherence means at the national level and how it could be improved. Such discussions and strategies to improve policy coherence that may results from it could feed into a country Voluntary National Review (VNR) or National Development Strategy or Plan development, to inform further efforts by the country to improve its ability to implement Agenda 2030 through better policy coherence. This document should be considered a living document which is regularly updated with the country experiences in putting in place and assessing mechanisms for policy coherence. These experiences, and related challenges, lessons learned and solutions, can be shared so that UNEP as custodian agency, with partners, can further refine this methodology and disseminated it not only as a tool to enable effective reporting but also to support national efforts toward policy coherence.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
