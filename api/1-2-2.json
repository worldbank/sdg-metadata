The most commonly used method is Alkire Foster (AF) methodology which identifies dimensions, typically health, education and living standards and several indicators in each dimension. The unit of analysis could be either individual or household. The individuals or households are considered as multidimensionally poor if they are deprived in multiple indicators exceeding certain thresholds. </p>\n<p>On the other hand, EU countries and North Macedonia use a completely different approach to measure the multidimensional poverty using the concept of &quot;people at risk of poverty or social exclusion&quot; (AROPE). AROPE consists of three indicators, and people will be considered as &quot;at risk of poverty or social exclusion&quot; if they are &quot;at risk of poverty&quot; or &quot;severely materially deprived&quot; or &quot;living in a household with a very low work intensity&quot;. </p>\n<p>Multidimensional deprivation for children is calculated based on the methodology called as Multiple Overlapping Deprivation Analysis (MODA). A child is considered multidimensionally poor if s/he is simultaneously deprived in multiple dimensions. It also identifies dimensions and indicators under each dimension, and has a similar structure with the AF methodology. However, it is strikingly different in that it focuses on the life-cycle of children and creates different sets of dimensions and indicators for different age groups, for instance, 0-4, 5-11, 12-14, 15-17, and conducts analysis separately for each age group. In the global SDG database, the multidimensional poverty headcount (%) for overall 0-17 age range has been used.</p><p>Proportion of population living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions [1.2.2] (SI_POV_NMPI) (%)</p>\n<p>Average proportion of deprivations for people multidimensionally poor [1.2.2] (SD_MDP_ANDI) (%)</p>\n<p>Proportion of children living in child-specific multidimensional poverty [1.2.2] (SD_MDP_CSMP) (%)</p>\n<p>Proportion of households living in multidimensional poverty [1.2.2] (SD_MDP_MUHHC) (%)</p><p>Data sources and methods used for data collection differ from survey to survey.

After integrating modification suggested from these two agencies, the data has been sent to the SDGs focal point personnel in the counterpart in each country for their final approval. Regarding those countries where we do not have any country offices such as OECD and EU countries, the World Bank collected the information based on the data source available online, and sent it directly to the official counterparts of each country.</p><p><strong>Data release:</strong></p>\n<p>EU countries and some Latin American countries such as Costa Rica and Ecuador conduct the survey and produce multidimensional indicators every year, but most of the developing countries, especially African countries have published multidimensional measurement only once in the last 10 years, or spasmodically when the funding was available.

However, the poor themselves consider their experience of poverty much more broadly. A person who is poor can suffer multiple disadvantages at the same time &#x2013; for example, they may have poor health or malnutrition, a lack of clean water or electricity, poor quality of work or little schooling. Focusing on one factor alone, such as income, is not enough to capture the true reality of poverty. Therefore, multidimensional poverty measures described above have been developed to create a more comprehensive picture by looking at multiple dimensions such as health, education, living standards. Official multidimensional poverty headcount (% population), official multidimensional poverty headcount (% of total households) and multidimensional deprivation for children (% of population under 18) are all about the headcount ratio trying to capture how many people, households, or children in the entire pool are regarded as multidimensionally poor. On the other hand, average number of deprivation tries to capture the depth of multidimensional poverty. For instance, if there are 18 indicators to capture different dimensions of poverty, a person or a household is considered to be deprived if they are shown to be deprived in at least 4 indicators. Therefore, the person who is deprived in 5 indicators, and the person who is deprived in 15 indicators are considered to be both multidimensionally poor. The &apos;intensity&apos; of the poverty is different between these two people, which is captured by the average number of deprivation. </p><p><strong>Comments and limitations:</strong></p>\n<p>It should be clearly noted that data in the above-mentioned series are not comparable across countries. For instance, AF methodology and AROPE are fundamentally very different, and although both produce some headcount ratio of people who are considered as &quot;multidimensionally poor&quot;, their definition of multidimensionality of poverty is utterly different, and so should not be compared. Also, even when they use the same approach, such as, AF, AROPE or MODA, the numbers are not comparable across countries, as the important parameters to calculate the figures such as the number of indicators, the weight allocated to each indicator, how to divide the age group of children are tailored to the country specific context. Furthermore, even in the same country, if the methodology is different, the number should not be compared. For instance, some countries calculate child multidimensional poverty headcount by using both AF and MODA methodologies, but their numbers could be very different as the dimensions and indicators used in both approaches differ significantly. To overcome these comparability issues, UNDP produces global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), which is the product of multiplying multidimensional headcount and average number of deprivations using the same dimensions and indicators covering more than 100 countries. However, most of these numbers are not officially approved by each country, and sometimes the nationally calculated MPI is different from the global MPI due to some difference of the parameters, therefore, in this platform, the global MPI is not included in the Global SDG Database. </p><p><strong>Computation Method:</strong></p>\n<p><u>Official multidimensional poverty headcount (% of population)</u></p>\n<p>First, we describe the AF methodology. Initially, the dimensions and indicators should be chosen. In the standard approach of the AF methodology, the dimension consists of health, education and living standards. Health consists of two indicators; nutrition and child mortality. Education consists of two indicators; years of schooling and school attendance. Living standards contain six indicators which are cooking fuel, drinking water, sanitation, electricity, housing and assets. Therefore, in this case, there are three dimensions and ten indicators. </p>\n<p>After dimensions and indicators are chosen, a deprivation cut-off is set for each indicator. In the above example, it would yield a set of 10 binary variables for every person - the value of 1 if the individual is deprived in that indicator and 0 otherwise. Once the set of binary variables is calculated, each person is assigned a deprivation score denoted as c, indicating the proportion of deprivations weighted by the relative importance of each indicator. The deprivation score c is defined to take values ranging between 0 (indicating that the person does not experience any weighted deprivations) and 1 (indicating that they experience weighted deprivations in all the 10 indicators). Then to identify people who suffer multidimensional poverty in the country, the deprivation score c is compared to a poverty cut-off point. All people suffering deprivations in a number of weighted deprivations equal to or greater than this cut-off are identified as multidimensionally poor. Further details on AF methodology can be found <a href=\"https://ophi.org.uk/research/multidimensional-poverty/\">here</a>. It should be noted that although the country adopts AF methodology to measure multidimensional poverty, the sets of dimensions and indicators could be different country by country, as they would be tailored to specific contexts of each country. For the detailed methodology used to calculate the country-specific multidimensional poverty indicators, please refer to the official documentation through the links listed at the end.</p>\n<p>Secondly, we describe the AROPE methodology. As mentioned above, the AROPE consists of three indicators, which are &quot;at risk of poverty&quot; or &quot;severely materially deprived&quot; or &quot;living in a household with a very low work intensity&quot;. The &quot;at risk of poverty rate&quot; is the share of people with an equivalised disposable income below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold, which is set at 60% of the national median equivalised disposable income after social transfers. The equivalised disposable income is the total income of a household, after tax and other deductions, that is available for spending or saving, divided by the number of household members converted into equalised adults; household members are equalised or made equivalent by weighting each according to their age, using the so-called modified OECD equivalence scale. For poverty indicators, the equivalised disposable income is calculated from the total disposable income of each household divided by the equivalised household size. The income reference period is a fixed 12-month period (such as the previous calendar or tax year) for all countries except the UK for which the income reference period is the current year and Ireland for which the survey is continuous and income is collected for the last twelve months. </p>\n<p>Material deprivation refers to a state of economic strain and durables, defined as the enforced inability (rather than the <em>choice</em> not to do so) to pay unexpected expenses, afford a one-week annual holiday away from home, a meal involving meat, chicken or fish every second day, the adequate heating of a dwelling, durable goods like a washing machine, colour television, telephone or car, being confronted with payment arrears (mortgage or rent, utility bills, hire purchase installments or other loan payments). The material deprivation rate is an indicator in <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:EU_statistics_on_income_and_living_conditions_(EU-SILC)\">EU-SILC</a> that expresses the inability to afford some items considered by most people to be desirable or even necessary to lead an adequate life. The indicator distinguishes between individuals who cannot afford a certain good or service, and those who do not have this good or service for another reason, e.g., because they do not want or do not need it. The indicator adopted by the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/spsi/social_protection_committee_en.htm\">Social protection committee</a> measures the percentage of the population that cannot afford at least three of the following nine items: 1) to pay their rent, mortgage or utility bills; 2) to keep their home adequately warm; 3) to face unexpected expenses; 4) to eat meat or proteins regularly; 5) to go on holiday; 6) a television set; 7) a washing machine; 8) a car; 9) a telephone. Severe material deprivation rate is defined as the enforced inability to pay for at least four of the above-mentioned items.</p>\n<p>The indicator &quot;persons living in households with very low work intensity&quot; is defined as the number of persons living in a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Household_-_social_statistics\">household</a> where the members of working age worked less than 20 % of their total potential during the previous 12 months. The work intensity of a household is the ratio of the total number of months that all working-age household members have worked during the income <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Reference_year\">reference year</a> and the total number of months the same household members theoretically could have worked in the same period. A working-age person is a person aged 18-59 years, with the exclusion of students in the age group between 18 and 24 years. Households composed only of children, of students aged less than 25 and/or people aged 60 or more are completely excluded from the indicator calculation. Further details on AROPE methodology can be found <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:At_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion_(AROPE)\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><u>Average number of deprivations (intensity)</u></p>\n<p>The multidimensional headcount is a useful measure, but it does not increase if poor people become more deprived. Because of that, we need a different set of measures, which is the average number of deprivations, also known as intensity. Intensity is calculated by adding up the proportion of total deprivations each person suffers and dividing by the total number of poor persons. For example, if say person 1 suffers 4 out of 6 deprivations and person 2 suffers 6 out of 6, and then the intensity will be calculated as (4/6 + 6/6)/2=5/6.</p>\n<p><u>Official multidimensional poverty headcount (% of total households)</u></p>\n<p>The calculation methodology is the same as the AF methodology described above, except for that the unit of analysis is household instead of individuals.</p>\n<p><u>Multidimensional deprivation for children (% of population under 18)</u></p>\n<p>In order to measure multidimensional poverty based on the MODA methodology, dimensions of children&apos;s well-being that best reflect the situation of poverty in the country should be defined. Each dimension of well-being is measured by a set of indicators based on available data. The selection of indicators and dimensions should be guided by data availability and relevance to children&apos;s needs and rights in each country&apos;s context. Given the life cycle approach emphasizing that children have different needs throughout the different phases of their childhood development, the selection of dimensions as well as the findings and results are disaggregated by age groups. Then a deprivation threshold is set for each indicator so that a child can be classified as either deprived or non-deprived in each indicator. For the multidimensional deprivation analysis, the number of dimensions in which a child is deprived is counted and then the percentage of children suffering from zero, one, two, three, etc deprivations is presented to see the distribution of deprivation. A cut-off point, or &quot;deprivation threshold&quot; (k) is used to define whether the child is multidimensionally poor or not and based on that, the percentage of multidimensionally poor children is calculated. It is important to note that a country-specific analysis is carried out adjusting the choice of dataset, age groups, dimensions, indicators and thresholds to better reflect each country&apos;s context and so the results presented in one country are not comparable with the findings of other countries on multidimensional poverty. Further details on MODA methodology can be found <a href=\"https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/695-step-by-step-guidelines-to-the-multiple-overlapping-deprivation-analysis-moda.html\">here</a>.</p><ul>\n  <li>At country level</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The treatment of missing values differs from survey to survey. For details, please refer to the official documentation through the links listed at the end.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>At regional and global levels</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No estimation by international agencies has been implemented for missing values in this data.</p><p>Since the data for indicator 1.2.2 are based on the national definitions of poverty &#x2013; and the methodologies used to produce them are different, as described in the &#x201C;comments and limitations&#x201D; section, data are not comparable across countries. Thus regional and global aggregates are not produced.</p><p>Initially, the data has been input by poverty economists, which has been checked carefully together with the metadata information by the central team for monitoring SDGs 1.2.2 in the World Bank. Then data has been sent to the UNDP and UNICEF for further verification.</p><p>Official multidimensional poverty headcount (% population) is disaggregated by sex and age. The age band for official multidimensional poverty headcount for children is mostly 0-17, but some countries have different age definition for children, such as 0-15 in El Salvador.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n<p>47 countries&apos; multidimensional poverty measurement are available. However, the data availability over time differs greatly from country to country. Please see the subsection, &#x201C;Time series&#x201D; below for further information. </p>\n<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>\n<p>The following table shows how many of the 5 headcount data (population, household, male, female, children) is available in each country. The little rectangular mark indicates that the intensity data is available as well and the double circle shows that the data on multidimensional deprivation for children is also available.</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>Country</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>2010</strong></p>\n      </td>\n

La méthode la plus couramment utilisée est la méthodologie Alkire Foster (AF) qui identifie les dimensions, généralement la santé, l’éducation et les niveaux de vie et plusieurs indicateurs dans chaque dimension. L’unité d’analyse peut être individuelle ou domestique. Les individus ou les ménages sont considérés comme multidimensionnellement pauvres s’ils sont privés dans de multiples indicateurs dépassant certains seuils. </p>\n<p> D’autre part, les pays de l’UE et la Macédoine du Nord utilisent une approche complètement différente pour mesurer la pauvreté multidimensionnelle en utilisant le concept de \"personnes menacées de pauvreté ou d’exclusion sociale\" (AROPE). L’AROPE se compose de trois indicateurs, et les personnes seront considérées comme \"à risque de pauvreté ou d’exclusion sociale\" si elles sont \"à risque de pauvreté\" ou \"gravement démunies matériellement\" ou \"vivant dans un ménage avec une très faible intensité de travail\". </p>\n<p> La privation multidimensionnelle chez les enfants est calculée sur la base de la méthodologie appelée analyse du chevauchement des privations multiples (MODA). Un enfant est considéré comme multidimensionnellement pauvre s’il est simultanément privé dans plusieurs dimensions. La méthodologie identifie également les dimensions et les indicateurs sous chaque dimension, et a une structure similaire à la méthodologie AF. Cependant, elle est étonnamment différente puisqu'elle se concentre sur le cycle de vie des enfants et crée différents ensembles de dimensions et d’indicateurs pour différents groupes d’âge, par exemple, 0-4, 5-11, 12-14, 15-17, et effectue une analyse séparément pour chaque groupe d’âge. Dans la base de données mondiale sur les ODD, le dénombrement multidimensionnel de la pauvreté (%) pour l’ensemble de la tranche d’âge de 0 à 17 ans a été utilisé. </p><p>Proportion de la population vivant dans la pauvreté sous toutes ses formes selon les définitions nationales [1.2.2] (SI_POV_NMPI) (%)</p>\n<p>Proportion moyenne de privations pour les personnes multidimensionnellement pauvres [1.2.2] (SD_MDP_ANDI) (%) </p>\n<p>Proportion d'enfants vivant dans une pauvreté multidimensionnelle spécifique à l'enfant [1.2.2] (SD_MDP_CSMP) (%) </p>\n<p>Proportion de ménages vivant dans la pauvreté multidimensionnelle [1.2.2] (SD_MDP_MUHHC) (%) </p><p>Les sources de données et les méthodes utilisées pour la collecte des données diffèrent d'une enquête à l'autre.

D'abord, les données ont été saisies par les économistes de la pauvreté de la Banque mondiale pour chaque pays, et ces données ont été envoyées aux responsables de l'UNICEF et du PNUD qui sont en charge de chaque pays pour la validation des données. Après avoir intégré les modifications suggérées par ces deux agences, les données ont été envoyées au personnel du point focal ODD de chaque pays pour leur approbation finale. En ce qui concerne les pays où nous n'avons pas de bureau national, comme les pays de l'OCDE et de l'UE, la Banque mondiale a collecté les informations sur la base des sources de données disponibles en ligne, et les a envoyées directement aux homologues officiels de chaque pays.</p><p><strong>Diffusion des données :</strong></p>\n<p>Les pays de l'UE et certains pays d'Amérique latine comme le Costa Rica et l'Équateur mènent l'enquête et produisent des indicateurs multidimensionnels chaque année, mais la plupart des pays en développement, en particulier les pays africains, n'ont publié des mesures multidimensionnelles qu'une seule fois au cours des 10 dernières années, ou de manière spasmodique lorsque le financement était disponible.

:</strong></p>\n<p>La pauvreté est traditionnellement définie comme le manque d'argent. Cependant, les pauvres eux-mêmes considèrent leur expérience de la pauvreté de manière beaucoup plus large. Une personne pauvre peut souffrir de plusieurs désavantages en même temps – par exemple, elle peut être en mauvaise santé ou souffrir de malnutrition, manquer d'eau potable ou d'électricité, avoir un travail de mauvaise qualité ou être peu scolarisée. Se concentrer sur un seul facteur, comme le revenu, ne suffit pas à saisir la véritable réalité de la pauvreté. C'est pourquoi les mesures de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle décrites ci-dessus ont été développées afin de créer une image plus complète en examinant de multiples dimensions telles que la santé, l'éducation, le niveau de vie. L'indice officiel de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle (% de la population), l'indice officiel de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle (% du total des ménages) et la privation multidimensionnelle des enfants (% de la population de moins de 18 ans) ont tous trait à l'indice de la pauvreté en essayant de saisir combien de personnes, de ménages ou d'enfants dans l'ensemble du bassin sont considérés comme pauvres de manière multidimensionnelle. D'autre part, le nombre moyen de privations tente de saisir la profondeur de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle. Par exemple, s'il existe 18 indicateurs pour saisir les différentes dimensions de la pauvreté, une personne ou un ménage est considéré comme démuni s'il apparaît qu'il est démuni dans au moins 4 indicateurs. Par conséquent, la personne qui est privée dans 5 indicateurs et la personne qui est privée dans 15 indicateurs sont considérées comme étant toutes deux multidimensionnellement pauvres. L'\"intensité\" de la pauvreté est différente entre ces deux personnes, ce qui est représenté par le nombre moyen de privations. </p><p><strong>Commentaires et limites :</strong></p>\n<p>Il convient de noter clairement que les données des séries susmentionnées ne sont pas comparables d'un pays à l'autre. Par exemple, la méthodologie AF et AROPE sont fondamentalement très différentes, et bien que les deux produisent un certain ratio d'effectifs de personnes considérées comme \"multidimensionnellement pauvres\", leur définition de la multidimensionnalité de la pauvreté est totalement différente, et ne doit donc pas être comparée . De plus, même lorsqu'ils utilisent la même approche, comme AF, AROPE ou MODA, les chiffres ne sont pas comparables d'un pays à l'autre, car les paramètres importants pour calculer les chiffres tels que le nombre d'indicateurs, le poids alloué à chaque indicateur et comment diviser le groupe d'âge des enfants sont adaptés au contexte spécifique du pays. De plus, si la méthodologie est différente dans un même pays, le nombre ne doit pas être comparé. Par exemple, certains pays calculent la pauvreté multidimensionnelle des enfants en utilisant à la fois les méthodologies AF et MODA, mais leurs chiffres peuvent être très différents car les dimensions et les indicateurs utilisés dans les deux approches diffèrent considérablement. Pour surmonter ces problèmes de comparabilité, le PNUD produit un indice mondial de pauvreté multidimensionnelle (IPM), qui est le produit de la multiplication des effectifs multidimensionnels et du nombre moyen de privations en utilisant les mêmes dimensions et indicateurs couvrant plus de 100 pays. Cependant, la plupart de ces chiffres ne sont pas officiellement approuvés par chaque pays, et parfois l'IPM calculé au niveau national est différent de l'IPM mondial en raison de certaines différences de paramètres. Par conséquent, dans cette plate-forme, l'IPM mondial n'est pas inclus dans la base de données mondiale des ODD. </p><p><strong>Méthode de calcul :</strong></p>\n<p><u>Dénombrement de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle (% de la population)</u></p>\n<p>Tout d'abord, nous décrivons la méthodologie de l'AF. Dans un premier temps, il s'agit de choisir les dimensions et les indicateurs. Dans l'approche standard de la méthodologie AF, la dimension peut être la santé, l'éducation et le niveau de vie. La santé se compose de deux indicateurs : la nutrition et la mortalité infantile. L'éducation se compose de deux indicateurs : le nombre d'années de scolarité et la fréquentation scolaire. Le niveau de vie comprend six indicateurs : combustible de cuisson, eau potable, installations sanitaires, électricité, logement et biens. Par conséquent, dans ce cas, il y a trois dimensions et dix indicateurs. </p>\n<p> Une fois les dimensions et les indicateurs choisis, un seuil de privation est fixé pour chaque indicateur. Dans l'exemple ci-dessus, cela donnerait un ensemble de 10 variables binaires pour chaque personne - la valeur 1 si l'individu est privé de cet indicateur et 0 sinon. Une fois l'ensemble des variables binaires calculé, chaque personne se voit attribuer un score de privation noté c, indiquant la proportion de privations pondérée par l'importance relative de chaque indicateur. Le score de privation c peut prendre des valeurs comprises entre 0 (indiquant que la personne ne subit aucune privation pondérée) et 1 (indiquant qu'elle subit des privations pondérées dans les 10 indicateurs). Ensuite, pour identifier les personnes qui souffrent de pauvreté multidimensionnelle dans le pays, le score de privation c est comparé à un seuil de pauvreté. Toutes les personnes souffrant de privations dans un nombre de privations pondérées égal ou supérieur à ce seuil sont identifiées comme étant multidimensionnellement pauvres. De plus amples détails sur la méthodologie AF peuvent être trouvés <a href=\"https://ophi.org.uk/research/multidimensional-poverty/\">ici</a>. Il convient de noter que même si le pays adopte la méthodologie AF pour mesurer la pauvreté multidimensionnelle, les ensembles de dimensions et d'indicateurs pourraient être différents d'un pays à l'autre, car ils seraient adaptés aux contextes spécifiques de chaque pays. Pour la méthodologie détaillée utilisée pour calculer les indicateurs de pauvreté multidimensionnelle spécifiques à chaque pays, veuillez vous référer à la documentation officielle via les liens listés à la fin. </p>\n<p> Deuxièmement, nous décrivons la méthodologie AROPE. Comme mentionné ci-dessus, l'AROPE se compose de trois indicateurs, qui sont \"le risque de pauvreté\" ou \"la privation matérielle sévère\" ou \"la vie dans un ménage à très faible intensité de travail\". Le \"taux de risque de pauvreté\" est la part des personnes dont le revenu disponible équivalent est inférieur au seuil de risque de pauvreté, qui est fixé à 60 % du revenu disponible équivalent médian national après transferts sociaux. Le revenu disponible équivalent est le revenu total d'un ménage, après impôts et autres déductions, qui peut être dépensé ou épargné, divisé par le nombre de membres du ménage convertis en adultes égalisés ; les membres du ménage sont égalisés ou rendus équivalents en les pondérant en fonction de leur âge, en utilisant l'échelle d'équivalence modifiée de l'OCDE. Pour les indicateurs de pauvreté, le revenu disponible égalisé est calculé à partir du revenu total disponible de chaque ménage divisé par la taille du ménage égalisé. La période de référence du revenu est une période fixe de 12 mois (telle que l'année civile ou fiscale précédente) pour tous les pays, à l'exception du Royaume-Uni pour lequel la période de référence du revenu est l'année en cours et de l'Irlande pour laquelle l'enquête est continue et le revenu est collecté pour les douze derniers mois. </p>\n<p>La privation matérielle fait référence à un état de contrainte économique et de biens durables, défini comme l'incapacité forcée (plutôt que le <em>choix</em> de ne pas le faire) de payer des dépenses imprévues, de s'offrir des vacances annuelles d'une semaine hors du domicile, un repas comprenant de la viande, du poulet ou du poisson tous les deux jours, le chauffage adéquat d'un logement, des biens durables tels qu'une machine à laver, une télévision couleur, un téléphone ou une voiture, d'être confronté à des arriérés de paiement (hypothèque ou loyer, factures de services publics, versements de location-vente ou autres paiements de prêts). Le taux de privation matérielle est un indicateur dans <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:EU_statistics_on_income_and_living_conditions_(EU-SILC)\">EU-SILC</a> qui exprime l'incapacité à se procurer certains articles considérés par la plupart des gens comme souhaitables ou même nécessaires pour mener une vie adéquate. L'indicateur fait la distinction entre les individus qui ne peuvent pas se permettre un certain bien ou service, et ceux qui ne disposent pas de ce bien ou service pour une autre raison, par exemple parce qu'ils ne le veulent pas ou n'en ont pas besoin. L'indicateur adopté par le <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/spsi/social_protection_committee_en.htm\">Comité de la protection sociale</a> mesure le pourcentage de la population qui ne peut se permettre au moins trois des neuf éléments suivants : 1) payer son loyer, son hypothèque ou ses factures de services publics ; 2) maintenir son logement suffisamment chaud ; 3) faire face à des dépenses imprévues ; 4) manger régulièrement de la viande ou des protéines ; 5) partir en vacances ; 6) un téléviseur ; 7) une machine à laver ; 8) une voiture ; 9) un téléphone. Le taux de privation matérielle sévère est défini comme l'incapacité forcée de payer au moins quatre des articles susmentionnés.</p>\n<p>L'indicateur \"personnes vivant dans des ménages à très faible intensité de travail\" est défini comme le nombre de personnes vivant dans un <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Household_-_social_statistics\">ménage</a> dont les membres en âge de travailler ont travaillé moins de 20 % de leur potentiel total au cours des 12 mois précédents. L'intensité de travail d'un ménage est le rapport entre le nombre total de mois pendant lesquels tous les membres du ménage en âge de travailler ont travaillé au cours de l'<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Reference_year\">année de référence</a> du revenu et le nombre total de mois pendant lesquels les mêmes membres du ménage auraient théoriquement pu travailler au cours de la même période. Une personne en âge de travailler est une personne âgée de 18 à 59 ans, à l'exclusion des étudiants dans le groupe d'âge entre 18 et 24 ans. Les ménages composés uniquement d'enfants, d'étudiants âgés de moins de 25 ans et/ou de personnes âgées de 60 ans ou plus sont totalement exclus du calcul de l'indicateur.

Pour cette raison, nous avons besoin d'un ensemble différent de mesures, à savoir le nombre moyen de privations, également appelé intensité. L'intensité est calculée en additionnant la proportion de privations totales dont souffre chaque personne et en la divisant par le nombre total de personnes pauvres. Par exemple, si la personne 1 souffre de 4 privations sur 6 et la personne 2 de 6 sur 6, l'intensité sera calculée comme suit : (4/6 + 6/6)/2=5/6.</p>.\n<p><u>Dénombrement officiel de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle (% du total des ménages)</u></p>\n<p>La méthodologie de calcul est la même que celle de la FA décrite ci-dessus, sauf que l'unité d'analyse est le ménage au lieu des individus</p>.\n<p><u>Privation multidimensionnelle pour les enfants (% de la population de moins de 18 ans)</u></p>\n<p>Afin de mesurer la pauvreté multidimensionnelle sur la base de la méthodologie MODA, il convient de définir les dimensions du bien-être des enfants qui reflètent le mieux la situation de pauvreté dans le pays. Chaque dimension du bien-être est mesurée par un ensemble d'indicateurs basés sur les données disponibles. La sélection des indicateurs et des dimensions doit être guidée par la disponibilité des données et la pertinence des besoins et des droits des enfants dans le contexte de chaque pays. Compte tenu de l'approche du cycle de vie qui souligne que les enfants ont des besoins différents au cours des différentes phases de leur développement, la sélection des dimensions ainsi que les conclusions et les résultats sont désagrégés par groupes d'âge. Ensuite, un seuil de privation est fixé pour chaque indicateur afin qu'un enfant puisse être classé comme privé ou non privé pour chaque indicateur. Pour l'analyse de la privation multidimensionnelle, le nombre de dimensions dans lesquelles un enfant est privé est compté, puis le pourcentage d'enfants souffrant de zéro, un, deux, trois, etc. privations est présenté pour voir la distribution de la privation. Un point de coupure, ou \"seuil de privation\" (k) est utilisé pour définir si l'enfant est multidimensionnellement pauvre ou non et sur cette base, le pourcentage d'enfants multidimensionnellement pauvres est calculé. Il est important de noter qu'une analyse spécifique à chaque pays est effectuée en ajustant le choix de l'ensemble de données, des groupes d'âge, des dimensions, des indicateurs et des seuils afin de mieux refléter le contexte de chaque pays. Ainsi, les résultats présentés dans un pays ne sont pas comparables aux conclusions d'autres pays sur la pauvreté multidimensionnelle.
