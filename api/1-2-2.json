The unit of analysis could be either the individual or the household. The individuals or households are considered as multidimensionally poor if they are deprived in multiple dimensions, exceeding certain thresholds. </p>\n<p>EU Member States, Island, Norway, Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Turkey have a different approach to measure the multidimensional poverty using the concept of &quot;people at risk of poverty or social exclusion&quot; (AROPE) calculated by EUROSTAT using the data from EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC). AROPE consists of three components, and individuals are considered as &quot;at risk of poverty or social exclusion&quot; if they are &quot;at risk of poverty&quot; or &quot;severely materially and socially deprived&quot; or &quot;living in a household with a very low work intensity&quot;. <sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[1]</a></sup></p>\n<p>There is a multidimensional poverty measure specifically designed for children. A child is considered multidimensionally poor if s/he is simultaneously deprived in multiple dimensions. It identifies the dimensions of poverty and the indicators under each dimension, and has a similar structure to the AF methodology. However, it is different in that it focuses on the life-cycle of children, creating different sets of dimensions and indicators for different age groups (e.g., for ages 0-4, 5-11, 12-14, 15-17 years), and conducts analyses separately for each age group. In the global SDG database, the multidimensional poverty headcount (%) for the overall 0-17 age group has been used for countries reporting individual measures of child multidimensional poverty.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">1</sup><p> For more information please see Eurostat&#x2019;s definitions <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=EU_statistics_on_income_and_living_conditions_(EU-SILC)_methodology_-_people_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion\">https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=EU_statistics_on_income_and_living_conditions_(EU-SILC)_methodology_-_people_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion</a>. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-2\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div><p>Percent (%)</p><p>Not applicable</p><p>Data sources used for calculating indicators differ from survey to survey in each country.

Statistical Commission has adopted <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/49th-session/documents/BG-Item-3a-IAEG-SDGs-DataFlowsGuidelines-E.pdf\">Guidelines on Data Flows and Global Data Reporting for the SDGs</a>, which aim to establish efficient and transparent mechanisms for reporting on SDG data from national to international levels. The guidelines define a framework for national and international agencies to work together to improve the transmission and validation of SDG data at the global level. </p>\n<p>The Statistical Commission sets these guidelines under the overarching Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics and the Principles Governing International Statistical Activities, emphasizing in particular the principles of transparency, collaboration and communication, and professional and ethical standards. </p>\n<p>The guidelines mandate that SDG indicators be based on data produced and owned by national statistical systems, and that national statistical offices (NSOs) play a central coordinating role in the reporting process. The guidelines outline the roles and responsibilities of entities involved in the compilation of SDG data for global reporting, including NSOs, other national institutions, and international organizations. </p>\n<p>At the national level, the NSO, as coordinator of the National Statistical System, is expected to identify a national data provider for each indicator and liaise between national entities and international custodian agencies. For SDG Indicator 1.2.2, the data provider would be the national entity that is leading the development and monitoring of a measure of national multidimensional poverty recognized as official by the government. </p>\n<p>At the global level, custodian agencies are mandated to compile national SDG indicator data, to harmonize it to ensure quality, international comparability and the computation of regional aggregates, and to report (upload) the data to the Global SDG Indicator Database. In many instances, custodian agencies also support the methodological development of indicators and provide technical assistance to under-resourced national statistical systems. Custodian agencies are expected to publish a timeline of data collection activities, to ensure transparency and sufficient time for NSOs and national data providers to respond to requests for SDG data. </p>\n<p>SDG 1.2.2 is different from other SDG indicators in two important ways. Firstly, it is nationally defined and not a uniform measure across countries, and therefore it is not internationally comparable. Secondly, its custodians are NSOs and not international agencies. Because of these characteristics, UNDP, UNICEF and the World Bank collaborate as special partner agencies to provide a platform for compiling national SDG 1.2.2 data and reporting it to the global SDG database, a function typically performed by custodian agencies. While the special partner agencies strive to ensure that reported data is official and of good quality, they do not perform any harmonization or other processing of the data. The Guidelines on Data Flows and Global Data Reporting for the SDGs also require that national metadata be submitted at the same time as SDG data, to ensure accuracy and international comparability. The variety of methodologies for SDG Indicator 1.2.2 increases the relevance of national metadata as an instrument to ensure high quality and the accuracy of reported data. The three agencies also have extensive portfolios of technical assistance and capacity support to countries for the development of their national measures of multidimensional poverty. </p><p>Poverty has traditionally been defined as the lack of money. However, the poor themselves consider their experience of poverty much more broadly. A person who is poor can suffer multiple disadvantages at the same time &#x2013; for example, they may have poor health or malnutrition, a lack of clean water or electricity, poor quality of work or little schooling. Focusing on one factor alone, such as income, is not enough to capture the true reality of poverty. Therefore, multidimensional poverty measures described above have been developed to create a more comprehensive picture by looking at multiple dimensions such as health, education, living standards. Official multidimensional poverty headcount (% population), official multidimensional poverty headcount (% of total households) and multidimensional deprivation for children (% of population under 18) are all about the headcount ratio trying to capture how many people, households, or children in the entire pool are regarded as multidimensionally poor. On the other hand, average share of weighted deprivation tries to capture the depth of multidimensional poverty. For instance, if there are 18 indicators to capture different dimensions of poverty, the person who is deprived in 5 indicators, and the person who is deprived in 15 indicators are considered to be both multidimensionally poor. However, the &apos;intensity&apos; of the poverty is different between these two people, which is captured by the average share of weighted deprivation.</p><p>The compiled data of SDG 1.2.2 is not intended to be comparable across countries due to national definitions. For instance, key parameters to calculate the measure such as the number of indicators, the weight allocated to each indicator etc, are tailored to the country specific context. </p><p>The measurement of poverty involves two crucial steps: (1) identification &#x2013; identifying who is poor, and (2) aggregation &#x2013; compiling the individual&#x2019;s information into a summary measure. There are different ways to perform these two steps. All measures currently being estimated by countries or multilateral organizations use the counting approach. Therefore, what follows relates only to counting approaches, even if other non-counting methodologies have been developed by experts. </p>\n<p>The identification and aggregation of the multidimensionally poor involves the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Define the set of relevant dimensions of poverty, and for each of these define a set of indicators.</li>\n  <li>For each dimension, determine the criteria to assess deprivation based on the indicators.</li>\n  <li>For each indicator, define a satisfaction threshold, such that a person (or household) with an achievement below the threshold will be identified as deprived in that indicator.</li>\n  <li>For each indicator, compare each person&#x2019;s (or household&#x2019;s) achievement with the satisfaction threshold and create a variable that assumes, for example, the value 1 if the person is deprived in that indicator and 0 otherwise, and then classify them as either deprived or not in that indicator. </li>\n  <li>For each individual (or household), sum up the number of deprivations. In the summation, each indicator can be weighted differently or equally. Typically, if there are more indicators in one dimension than in others, indicator weights are adjusted to ensure equal weights across dimensions, but this need not be the case.</li>\n  <li>Define a poverty cut-off, such that a person exceeding the cut-off will be identified and counted (aggregated) as poor. </li>\n  <li>Aggregate up across individuals (or households) to obtain a measurement of multidimensional poverty for the country or region of interest. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>To illustrate this method, suppose a hypothetical society with five people, where multidimensional poverty is measured based on four indicators: per capita household income, years of schooling, access to sanitation, and access to source of water. The deprivation thresholds for these indicators are, respectively: 400 monetary units (e.g. dollars, pesos, shillings), 5 years of schooling for adults, having access to improved sanitation, and having access to improved sources of water. In this example, the four indicators are weighted equally<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[2]</a></sup>, and the multidimensional poverty cut-off is two out of the four indicators. That is, the person would be considered poor if she is deprived in at least two out of the four indicators. Table 2 presents the individuals&#x2019; achievements in each of the four relevant indicators, and the deprivation cut-offs are shown in the bottom row. The achievements falling below the deprivation thresholds are highlighted in red. Table 3 shows the deprivation status of all individuals in the four indicators. Column (5) shows the sum of deprivations. Comparing this sum with the poverty cut-off (as mentioned above, two out of four) the individuals can be classified as poor and non-poor, as shown in column (6). </p>\n<p><strong>Table 2.

</tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The last step involves aggregating the information across individuals. The most common summary measure is the headcount ratio or incidence of poverty. The headcount ratio is the proportion of the total population classed as poor. In the example above, the incidence of multidimensional poverty is 60 percent (<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mn>3</mn>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mn>5</mn>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n    <mo>&#xD7;</mo>\n    <mn>100</mn>\n  </math>). All empirical examples discussed in this section use the headcount ratio as the core measure of multidimensional poverty. On one hand, this measure is very intuitive and can be disaggregated by population sub-groups. On the other hand, it cannot be broken down by the contributions of each different indicator and it is not sensitive to the number of deprivations experienced by the poor. Because of these limitations, some methodologies propose other summary measures in addition to the headcount ratio. For the purpose of reporting on SDG Indicator 1.2.2, countries only need to compute the headcount ratio. </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Unmet Basic Needs</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The measures of Unmet Basic Needs (UBN), which proliferated in Latin America in the 1980s, are a direct application of the counting approach.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-ref-4\">[3]</a></sup> These measures often use census data to produce detailed maps of poverty and can also be estimated using household surveys. They identify the poor using the counting approach as described above, following all the steps mentioned, and aggregate the information across households and people using incidence ratios. Most generally, the share of households or individuals with unmet basic needs is presented for different poverty cut-offs &#x2013; that is, the proportion of households and people with one or more unmet basic need, the proportion of households and people with two or more unmet basic needs, and so on. The basic needs considered in these measures usually include (Feres and Mancero, 2001): access to housing that meets minimum housing standards, access to basic services that guarantee minimum sanitary conditions, access to basic education, and economic capacity to achieve minimum consumption levels. When these measures are estimated using census data, they can be highly disaggregated geographically, which makes it possible to construct detailed maps of poverty at district, municipality and even census ratio levels. Because of this property, maps of unmet basic needs have sometimes been used to allocate resources across areas. </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Multidimensional Poverty Measurement in Mexico</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The counting approach has been used to assess the number of people that are deprived simultaneously in income and in some non-monetary dimensions.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-5\" id=\"footnote-ref-5\">[4]</a></sup> Early applications can be found in Ireland, and more recently, in the United Kingdom for measuring child poverty.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-6\" id=\"footnote-ref-6\">[5]</a></sup> But the first country to develop an official and permanent measure of multidimensional poverty in the developing world was Mexico. The National Council for Evaluation of Social Development Policy (CONEVAL) led that process. In Mexico, multidimensional poverty is measured in the space of economic well-being and social rights, at the individual level:</p>\n<p>&#x201C;A person is considered to be multidimensionally poor when the exercise of at least one of her social rights is not guaranteed and if she also has an income that is insufficient to buy the goods and services required to fully satisfy her needs.&#x201D; (<a href=\"https://www.coneval.org.mx/rw/resource/coneval/med_pobreza/MPMMPingles100903.pdf\">CONEVAL, 2010</a>) </p>\n<p><strong>Table 4: Dimensions and indicators of the measure of multidimensional poverty of Mexico</strong></p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Type of Dimension</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Dimension</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Indicator</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Economic well-being</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Economic well-being</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Income per capita</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td rowspan=\"6\">\n        <p>Social rights</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Education</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Educational gap (meeting a minimum level of education for their age cohort)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Health</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Enrolled in the Social Health Protection System</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Social security</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Access to social security</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Housing </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Quality and spaces of dwelling (floor, roof, walls, and overcrowding)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Services in the dwelling</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Access to basic services in dwelling (water, drainage, electricity, cooking fuel)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Food</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Food security</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>All persons whose income per capita is insufficient to cover necessary goods and services are considered deprived in economic well-being. For social rights, each of the six indicators in Table is generated as a binary variable, with 1 representing deprivation, and 0 otherwise. In the cases in which there is more than one indicator, that is, for housing and access to services in the dwelling, the individual is classified as deprived if she fails to meet the threshold for any single indicator within the dimension. The social deprivation index is then defined as the sum of these six indicators associated with social deprivation. The six dimensions are equally weighted, as all human rights are considered equally important. The social deprivation index thus takes a value between zero (the person is not deprived in any of the six social rights indicators) and six (the individual is deprived in all of them).</p>\n<p>The classification of the population according to this method is illustrated in Figure 1. The vertical axis represents the space of economic well-being, measured by per capita household income. The horizontal axis represents the space of social rights. In this axis, individuals at the origin have a social deprivation index of six, individuals placed more to the right have fewer deprivations. The deprivation cutoff in the space of social rights is one, and individuals to the left of this threshold or on this threshold are considered to be deprived in social rights. People are divided into four groups (CONEVAL 2010, p. 32):</p>\n<ol>\n  <li><em>Multidimensionally poor</em>. People with an income below the economic well-being threshold and with one or more unfulfilled social rights.</li>\n  <li><em>Vulnerable due to social deprivation</em>. Socially deprived people with an income higher than the economic well-being threshold.</li>\n  <li><em>Vulnerable due to income</em>. Population with no social deprivations and with an income below the economic well-being threshold.</li>\n  <li><em>Not multidimensionally poor and not vulnerable</em>.

Adapted of CONEVAL (2010).</p>\n<p>Among the multidimensionally poor, those in extreme poverty are also identified, by considering a lower economic well-being threshold (the minimum economic well-being threshold)<sup><a href=\"#footnote-7\" id=\"footnote-ref-7\">[6]</a></sup> and a higher deprivation threshold of three of more social deprivations. </p>\n<p>In terms of aggregation, Mexico produces several categories of summary measures. The core measure is the headcount ratio, that is, the proportion of people who are multidimensionally poor (i.e. the proportion of people in group I in Figure 1). In addition, other headcount measures are also reported, such as the proportion of people deprived in economic well-being, the proportion deprived in each of the social rights, and the proportion showing one or more social deprivations. The depth of poverty is computed separately with respect to economic well-being and social deprivations. The depth of poverty in terms of economic well-being is the average gap between the well-being threshold and the income of poor people.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-8\" id=\"footnote-ref-8\">[7]</a></sup> This measure is reported for groups I and III in Figure 1. The depth of poverty in terms of social deprivations is the average proportion of deprivations among those suffering at least one deprivation. This measure is reported for groups I and II in Figure 1. Finally, the intensity of poverty corresponds to the product of the headcount ratio and the depth of poverty.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-9\" id=\"footnote-ref-9\">[8]</a></sup> This measure is computed for the multidimensionally poor (group I) and the socially deprived (group II).</p>\n<p>In 2015, Vietnam launched their official multidimensional poverty index, following an approach similar to the one adopted in Mexico but using the household as the unit of analysis. A multidimensionally poor household is a household (1) whose monthly average income per capita is at or below income-based poverty line, OR (2) whose monthly average income per capita is above income-based poverty line but below minimum living standard AND is deprived on at least 3 indices for measuring deprivation of access to basic social services. Ten indicators are included in the list of basic social services. These are (1) adult education, (2) child school attendance, (3) accessibility to health care services, (4) health insurance, (5) quality of house, (6) housing area per capita, (7) drinking water supply, (8) hygienic toilet/latrine, (9) use of telecommunication services, and (10) assets for information accessibility.<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-10\" id=\"footnote-ref-10\">[9]</a></sup></sup></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>At Risk of Poverty or Social Exclusion</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The &#x201C;at-risk-of-poverty or social exclusion&#x201D; rate, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:At_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion_(AROPE)\">AROPE</a>, is the main indicator to monitor the EU 2030 target on poverty and social exclusion, aiming at reducing the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion by at least 15 million, out of them, at least 5 million should be children. It also was the headline indicator to monitor the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:EU_2020_Strategy\">EU 2020 Strategy</a> poverty target. It is defined as the proportion of people (or number of persons) that are either at risk of (monetary) poverty, or are living in a household with very low work intensity, or are severely materially and socially deprived. In other words, AROPE considers three dimensions/indicators, and the individual is at risk of poverty or social exclusion if she is deprived in at least one of those components. </p>\n<p>An individual is <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:At-risk-of-poverty_rate\">at-risk-of-poverty</a> if:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>She has an equivalized disposable income (after social transfers) below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold, which is defined as the 60 percent of the national median equivalized disposable income after social transfers. </li>\n  <li>Lives in a household with <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Persons_living_in_households_with_low_work_intensity\">very low work intensity</a>, defined as &#x201C;people from 0-64 years living in households where the adults (those aged 18-64, but excluding students aged 18-24 and people who are retired according to their self-defined current economic status or who receive any pension (except survivors pension), as well as people in the age bracket 60-64 who are inactive and living in a household where the main income is pensions) worked a working time equal or less than 20% of their total combined work-time potential during the previous year&#x201D;. </li>\n  <li>Is <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Severe_material_and_social_deprivation_rate_(SMSD)&amp;stable=0&amp;redirect=no\">severely materially and socially deprived</a>, that is if she or her household cannot afford at least seven of the following 13 items<sup><a href=\"#footnote-11\" id=\"footnote-ref-11\">[10]</a></sup>:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>List of items at household level:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Capacity to face unexpected expenses</li>\n  <li>Capacity to afford paying for one week annual holiday away from home</li>\n  <li>Capacity to being confronted with payment arrears (on mortgage or rental payments, utility bills, hire purchase instalments or other loan payments)</li>\n  <li>Capacity to afford a meal with meat, chicken, fish or vegetarian equivalent every second day</li>\n  <li>Ability to keep home adequately</li>\n  <li>Have access to a car/van for personal use</li>\n  <li>Replacing worn-out furniture</li>\n</ul>\n<p>List of items at individual level:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Having internet connection</li>\n  <li>Replacing worn-out clothes by some new ones</li>\n  <li>Having two pairs of properly fitting shoes (including a pair of all-weather shoes)</li>\n  <li>Spending a small amount of money each week on him/herself</li>\n  <li>Having regular leisure activities</li>\n  <li>Getting together with friends/family for a drink/meal at least once a month</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The information on the individuals at risk of poverty and social exclusion is aggregated in the form of an incidence rate, the proportion of individuals in the total population that are identified as being at risk of poverty or social exclusion. People are included only once even if they are in more than one situation (AROPE components mentioned above).</p>\n<p>The construction of AROPE follows the same steps outlined above that are used in the UBN or mixed (CONEVAL) experiences. In addition, as in the two other highlighted cases, the three dimensions are equally weighted. However, while CONEVAL takes as deprived in social rights as those suffering from at least one deprivation in any indicator within this dimension, AROPE requires that within material and social deprivation at least seven deprivation items out of 13 are needed for establishing severe material and social deprivation.</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Alkire-Foster Approach to Multidimensional Poverty </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Alkire and Foster presented a family of multidimensional poverty measures based on the counting approach, which has captured global attention and is being widely adopted by countries. The first and most well-known application is the UNDP-OPHI Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) at the global level, which has been published since 2011. Since then, many countries have followed their guidance in what is known as &#x201C;the MPI approach.&#x201D; </p>\n<p>The Alkire-Foster family of measures follows the five steps of counting approaches described above and the two stages of identification and aggregation: (1) there is a first cut-off for each deprivation-specific threshold, and (2) there is second cut-off at the aggregation stage to determine whether the person (or household) is multidimensionally poor based on the deprivation score. Differential weights are sometimes used at the aggregation stage, but they are not mandatory. This results in an estimate of the incidence or prevalence of poverty, which is usually referred as H.</p>\n<p>An innovation introduced by the Alkire-Foster family of measures is that it is possible to account simultaneously for both the incidence of poverty (H), as well as its intensity (A).<sup><a href=\"#footnote-12\" id=\"footnote-ref-12\">[11]</a></sup> The intensity of poverty &#x2013; also called breadth of poverty &#x2013; is defined as the average proportion of the relevant multidimensional poverty indicators (weighted or not) in which the poor are deprived. When using categorical variables, it is possible to estimate an adjusted headcount ratio (<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msub>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>M</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mn>0</mn>\n      </mrow>\n    </msub>\n  </math> or MPI), where </p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msub>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>M</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mn>0</mn>\n      </mrow>\n    </msub>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mi>H</mi>\n    <mo>&#xD7;</mo>\n    <mi>A</mi>\n  </math><em>.</em></p>\n<p>The adjusted headcount ratio, just like the other measures described in this note, can be disaggregated by population subgroups (e.g. geographic area, ethnicity), and it can be broken down by dimension or indicator. For more details on the methodology, see Alkire et al. (2015). </p>\n<p>The Alkire-Foster approach can be seen as a general framework to measure multidimensional poverty that can be tailored to very different contexts. Many of the existing permanent national statistics of multidimensional poverty are based on the global MPI, but with substantial modifications in terms of dimensions, indicators, and thresholds.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-13\" id=\"footnote-ref-13\">[12]</a></sup> Since 2018, the World Bank regularly presents multidimensional poverty measures across countries using the headcount ratio (H), as is done by UNDP-OPHI measure, albeit with differences in the selection of parameters, some of the indicators, and sources of data. In addition to the headcount ratio, the 2018 Poverty and Shared Prosperity report, where the World Bank introduced this multidimensional measure, presents estimates of global poverty using the adjusted headcount ratio of the Alkire-Foster family as well as the distribution-sensitive multidimensional poverty measure, proposed in Datt (2018). </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Child Poverty</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Children experience and suffer poverty differently than adults (UNICEF, 2019). Their needs are also different, for example in terms of nutrition or education. However, children are often invisible in poverty estimates. That is why the SDG 1.2.2 explicitly mentions children and why countries should establish a child-specific measure of poverty. The European Conference of Statisticians (2020) recommends that countries &#x201C;develop child-specific and life-cycle adapted multidimensional poverty measures&#x201D; (Recommendation 29). </p>\n<p>If child-specific poverty measures are not developed, there is a risk of misinterpreting the evolving situation of children and consequently misinterpreting the impact of policies and external shocks. It is possible that while the situation of children in a given household deteriorates, that household becomes &#x201C;non-poor&#x201D; due to indicators that matter only for adults. In such a case, despite the fact that these children are worse-off than they were before, they would no longer be counted as poor. </p>\n<p>Over 70 low- and middle-income countries which have carried out child poverty analyses based on a child-specific measure of child poverty use the child as the unit of analysis. These countries are in all regions of the developing world, (e.g. Argentina, Armenia, Brazil, Egypt, Ethiopia, Mexico, Sierra Leone, Uganda, and Zambia), as well as in the European Union.</p>\n<p>Estimating multidimensional child poverty follows the same steps as the other examples mentioned above: the relevant dimensions are identified, criteria to assess deprivation in each dimension are established, and deprived children in each dimension are identified. A threshold is then specified concerning the minimum number of dimensions in which a child must be deprived to be considered poor, and children above or below this threshold are then counted. Moreover, the percentage (and number) of children deprived in exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, et cetera, deprivations are reported and analyzed, as well as the overlaps or simultaneous deprivations. This makes it possible to measure the incidence, the breadth, and the severity of poverty in a simple and integrated way.</p>\n<p>For child poverty, the selection of dimensions should be based on child rights. However, not all rights constitute child poverty, as explained in the Guidelines on Human Rights and Poverty from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. According to the Conference of European Statisticians: &#x201C;Deprivation measures need to be based upon a clear and explicit theory or normative definition of poverty in order to ensure that each indicator is a valid measure, i.e. that <strong>it measures poverty and not some other related (or unrelated) concept such as wellbeing [sic] or happiness</strong>&#x201D; (Recommendation 28 (a), emphasis added).</p>\n<p>As in the case of CONEVAL (explicitly) and UBN (implicitly), no differential weights should be applied across dimensions because they are rights. All rights are equally important and cannot be substituted. This is not just emanating from the human rights approach, but it is also the case with capabilities approach, as stated by Dixon and Nussbaum (2012): &#x201C;A Capabilities Approach is generally committed to the equal protection of rights for all up to a certain threshold. Any trade-off that leaves some people below this threshold will thus be a clear failure of basic justice under a Capabilities Approach&#x201D; (Children&#x2019;s Rights and a Capabilities Approach: The Question of Special Priority, p. 554, Public Law and Legal Theory Working Paper No. 384.)</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-3\">2</sup><p> Decanq and Lugo (2013) explore and explain various approaches to setting weights. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-3\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-4\">3</sup><p> This approach was proposed in several publications before being adopted widely in Latin America.

After integrating inputs from these three agencies, the data is sent to the SDGs focal point for each country for their final approval.

Thus, regional and global aggregates are not produced.</p><p>A successful measure of multidimensional poverty should be rigorous, institutionalized, sustainable, and useful. Such a measure generates credible and relevant information, and it is established as an official permanent statistic alongside traditional ones such as the income or expenditure poverty headcount and poverty gaps. As with other indicators, it is important that a clear and transparent system be in place for the regular updating of the measurement. This implies that the responsibility for these updates is assigned to an official entity and that associated costs are incorporated in the government&#x2019;s budget. Ideally, a multidimensional poverty measure could be used actively to guide policy-making (e.g. policies coordination, targeting, and policy evaluation). </p>\n<p>To make such a measure institutional and useful, it is fundamental for the government to own the process. Having the support of high-level representatives within the government, such as the president or prime minister, or ministers, grants additional legitimacy to the process and may facilitate the adoption of the measure by other levels of government and stakeholders. In addition, a high-level official may be able to bring other relevant actors into the design process and work on the institutionalization of the measure. The active participation of different ministries in the discussions and decisions throughout the process of design, namely the selection of indicators, respective cut-offs, and weights, is essential to ensure that the final measure meets the needs of policy makers in a specific country context.</p>\n<p>To make a measure long-lasting, rather than specific to a particular administration, it is useful to build consensus and a shared sense of legitimacy around the measure that transcends individual political actors. This requires that the process of developing the measure is perceived as credible, transparent, and non-partisan. Engaging key stakeholders, such as academics, opinion leaders, the opposition, and civil society representatives throughout the process is highly desirable. This should include wide consultations with the public, for example through nationally representative surveys to capture the national consensus about the minima required to satisfy different dimensions. In addition, it is important to have a well-designed communication strategy to explain the concept and the process to these different actors, allowing for channels for them to participate in the discussions about the design of the measure. Some countries have opted for involving a poverty committee that gathers experts and representatives from different sectors of society in the decision process of designing the measure. </p>\n<p>More specifically, the design of a measure of multidimensional poverty generally involves a technical process, complemented and supported by a political process. If both technical and political committees are set up, it is useful to agree on: (1) a plan of activities and timeline; (2) a schedule of regular interactions to ensure good communication; and (3) a documentation system that keeps track of all decisions and respective rationales. However, political interference in the technical process should be avoided, as recommended by the UNSD National Quality Assurance Frameworks Manual for Official Statistics.</p><p>The data has been validated by a three-stage approach to assure its accuracy.

The age band for official multidimensional poverty headcount for children is mostly 0-17, but some countries have different age definition for children, such as 0-15 in El Salvador. Geographically it is disaggregated by urban and rural areas.</p>\n<p><strong>Years of Reporting:</strong></p>\n<p>Years of reporting in the SDG 1.2.2 indicators are those when the source survey has been conducted except for the AROPE. When the survey year is split into two years, the first year has been reported. In AROPE, the reference period for all dimensions along with the indicators is disseminated as well as variables related to the materially deprived items in question in the survey year, except for age, income, variables on arrears, work intensity of the household, country of birth. As far as age is concerned, depending on the EU-SILC question, age can refer to two different moments in time: (i) age at the end of the income reference period; (ii) age at the date of interview. The age at the end of the income reference period is considered as the main age (e.g. it is used to define the statistical population, sample person, etc.). For income, the income reference period is a fixed 12-month period (such as the previous calendar or tax year). Variables on arrears refer to the last 12 months, while work intensity of the household refers to the number of months that all working age household members have been working during the income reference year. </p>\n<p><strong>Data Availability:</strong></p>\n<p>So far, 78 countries&apos; multidimensional poverty measurements were reported and confirmed by SDG focal points.

definitions. It is quite common that countries use a different number of dimensions and a variety of indicators depending on the country context. As SDG 1.2.2 explicitly says multidimensional poverty should be estimated in each country according to national definitions, this lack of comparability is not an issue.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>\n<p>Given there is no custodian agency to estimate internationally comparable levels of multidimensional poverty, there are no, <em>stricto sensu</em>, challenges in terms of discrepancies. Nevertheless, sometimes agencies do calculate multidimensional poverty, using common and comparable dimensions, indicators, and thresholds for different types of reports or analyses. In these cases, it has to be remembered that these are not official (i.e. government sanctioned and approved) estimates.

L’unité d’analyse pourrait être soit l’individu, soit le ménage. Les individus ou les ménages sont considérés comme multidimensionnellement pauvres s’ils sont privés dans de multiples dimensions, dépassant certains seuils. </p>\n<p>Les pays de l’UE, la Macédoine du Nord et la Turquie ont une approche différente pour mesurer la pauvreté multidimensionnelle en utilisant le concept de « personnes menacées de pauvreté ou d’exclusion sociale » (AROPE) calculées par EUROSTAT à l’aide des données des statistiques de l’UE sur le revenu et les conditions de vie (EU-SILC). L’AROPE se compose de trois indicateurs, et les individus sont considérés comme« à risque de pauvreté ou d’exclusion sociale » s’ils sont « à risque de pauvreté » ou « gravement démunis matériellement » ou « vivant dans un ménage avec une très faible intensité de travail ». </p>\n<p>Il existe une mesure multidimensionnelle de la pauvreté spécialement conçue pour les enfants. Un enfant est considéré comme multidimensionnellement pauvre s’il est simultanément privé dans plusieurs dimensions. La méthodologie identifie les dimensions de la pauvreté et les indicateurs sous chaque dimension, et a une structure similaire à la méthodologie AF. Cependant, elle est différente puisqu'elle met l’accent sur le cycle de vie des enfants, en créant différents ensembles de dimensions et d’indicateurs pour différents groupes d’âge (p. ex., pour les enfants de 0 à 4 ans, de 5 à 11 ans, de 12 à 14 ans, de 15 à 17 ans) et effectue des analyses séparément pour chaque groupe d’âge. Dans la base de données mondiale sur les ODD, le dénombrement de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle (%) pour l’ensemble du groupe d’âge des 0 à 17 ans a été utilisé pour les pays déclarant des mesures individuelles de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle des enfants. </p><p>L’unité pour l’indicateur 1) et 5) est le pourcentage de la population, tandis que l’unité pour l’indicateur 3) est le pourcentage des ménages. L’unité pour l’indicateur 2) et 4) est la proportion. </p><p>Les sources de données utilisées pour calculer les indicateurs diffèrent d’une enquête à l’autre dans chaque pays. Pour plus de détails, veuillez vous référer à la documentation officielle via les liens énumérés à la fin. </p><p>Les méthodes de collecte de données utilisées pour calculer les indicateurs diffèrent d’une enquête à l’autre dans chaque pays.

Pour plus de détails, veuillez vous référer à la documentation officielle via les liens énumérés à la fin. </p><p>Les pays de l’UE et certains pays d’Amérique latine mènent l’enquête et produisent des indicateurs multidimensionnels chaque année, mais la plupart des pays en développement n’ont publié des mesures multidimensionnelles qu’une ou quelques fois au cours des 10 dernières années. Pour ces pays, il est difficile de préciser quand les prochaines données seront disponibles. </p><p>Voici la liste des fournisseurs nationaux de données responsables de la production des données au

href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/49th-session/documents/BG-Item-3a-IAEG-SDGs-DataFlowsGuidelines-E.pdf\">« Guidelines on Data Flows and Global Data Reporting for the SDGs »</a>, qui visent à établir des mécanismes efficaces et transparents pour la communication des données sur les ODD du niveau national au niveau international. Les lignes directrices définissent un cadre permettant aux agences nationales et internationales de travailler ensemble pour améliorer la transmission et la validation des données des ODD au niveau mondial. </p>\n<p>La Commission de statistique établit ces lignes directrices dans le cadre des Principes fondamentaux de la statistique officielle et des Principes régissant les activités statistiques internationales, en mettant l'accent en particulier sur les principes de transparence, de collaboration et de communication, ainsi que sur les normes professionnelles et éthiques. </p>\n<p>Les directives stipulent que les indicateurs des ODD doivent être basés sur des données produites et détenues par les systèmes statistiques nationaux, et que les bureaux nationaux de statistique jouent un rôle de coordination central dans le processus de notification. Les lignes directrices décrivent les rôles et les responsabilités des entités impliquées dans la compilation des données sur les ODD pour les rapports mondiaux, y compris les bureaux nationaux de statistique (BNS), d'autres institutions nationales et les organisations internationales. </p>\n<p>Au niveau national, le BNS, en tant que coordonnateur du système statistique national, est censé identifier un fournisseur national de données pour chaque indicateur et assurer la liaison entre les entités nationales et les agences dépositaires internationales. Pour l'indicateur ODD 1.2.2, le fournisseur de données serait l'entité nationale qui dirige le développement et le suivi d'une mesure de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle nationale reconnue comme officielle par le gouvernement. </p>\n<p>Au niveau mondial, les agences dépositaires sont mandatées pour compiler les données des indicateurs nationaux des ODD, pour les harmoniser afin d'assurer la qualité, la comparabilité internationale et le calcul des agrégats régionaux, et pour télécharger les données dans la base de données mondiale des indicateurs des ODD. Dans de nombreux cas, les agences dépositaires soutiennent également le développement méthodologique des indicateurs et fournissent une assistance technique aux systèmes statistiques nationaux qui manquent de ressources. Les agences dépositaires doivent publier un calendrier des activités de collecte de données, afin d'assurer la transparence et suffisamment de temps pour que les BNS et les fournisseurs de données nationaux répondent aux demandes de données sur les ODD. </p>\n<p>L'indicateur 1.2.2 des ODD diffère des autres indicateurs ODD de deux manières importantes. Premièrement, il est défini au niveau national et n'est pas une mesure uniforme entre les pays, et n'est donc pas comparable au niveau international. Deuxièmement, ses agences dépositaires sont des BNS et non des agences internationales. En raison de ces caractéristiques, le PNUD, l'UNICEF et la Banque mondiale collaborent en tant qu'agences partenaires spéciales pour fournir une plate-forme pour compiler les données nationales sur l'indicateur 1.2.2 des ODD et les télécharger dans la base de données mondiale sur les ODD, une fonction généralement remplie par les agences dépositaires. Alors que les agences partenaires spéciales s'efforcent de s'assurer que les données déclarées sont officielles et de bonne qualité, elles n'effectuent aucune harmonisation ou autre traitement des données. Les lignes directrices sur les flux de données et la communication de données mondiales pour les ODD exigent également que les métadonnées nationales soient soumises en même temps que les données des ODD, afin de garantir l'exactitude et la comparabilité internationale. La variété des méthodologies pour l'indicateur 1.2.2 des ODD accroît la pertinence des métadonnées nationales en tant qu'instrument pour garantir la haute qualité et l'exactitude des données communiquées. Les trois agences disposent également de vastes portefeuilles d'assistance technique et de soutien aux capacités des pays pour le développement de leurs mesures nationales de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle. </p><p>La pauvreté est traditionnellement définie comme le manque d'argent. Cependant, les pauvres eux-mêmes considèrent leur expérience de la pauvreté de manière beaucoup plus large. Une personne pauvre peut souffrir de plusieurs désavantages en même temps – par exemple, elle peut être en mauvaise santé ou souffrir de malnutrition, manquer d'eau potable ou d'électricité, avoir un travail de mauvaise qualité ou être peu scolarisée. Se concentrer sur un seul facteur, comme le revenu, ne suffit pas à saisir la véritable réalité de la pauvreté. C'est pourquoi les mesures de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle décrites ci-dessus ont été développées afin de créer une image plus complète en examinant de multiples dimensions telles que la santé, l'éducation et le niveau de vie. L'indice officiel de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle (% de la population), l'indice officiel de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle (% du total des ménages) et la privation multidimensionnelle des enfants (% de la population de moins de 18 ans) ont tous trait à l'indice de la pauvreté en essayant de saisir combien de personnes, de ménages ou d'enfants dans l'ensemble du bassin sont considérés comme pauvres de manière multidimensionnelle. D’autre part, la part moyenne de la privation pondérée tente de saisir la profondeur de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle. Par exemple, s’il existe 18 indicateurs pour saisir différentes dimensions de la pauvreté, la personne qui est démunie dans 5 indicateurs et la personne qui est privée dans 15 indicateurs sont considérées comme étant toutes deux multidimensionnellement pauvres. Cependant, l’« intensité » de la pauvreté est différente entre ces deux personnes, ce qui est représenté par la part moyenne de privation pondérée.</p><p>Les données compilées de l'ODD 1.2.2 ne sont pas destinées à être comparables entre les pays en raison des différences méthodologiques. Par exemple, bien que la méthodologie AF et AROPE produisent le ratio d'effectif des personnes considérées comme « multidimensionnellement pauvres », leur définition de la multidimensionnalité est différente et ne peut être comparée. En outre, même lorsque les pays utilisent la même approche (p. ex., AF, AROPE ou MODA), les statistiques ne sont pas toujours comparables, car les paramètres clés pour calculer la mesure tels que le nombre d'indicateurs, le poids attribué à chaque indicateur, etc. sont adaptés au contexte spécifique du pays. De plus, dans un même pays, si la méthodologie est différente, les estimations ne doivent pas être comparées. Par exemple, si un pays calcule sa pauvreté multidimensionnelle officielle en utilisant la mesure AF mais la pauvreté multidimensionnelle des enfants en utilisant la méthodologie MODA, les mesures pourraient être très différentes car les dimensions et les indicateurs utilisés dans les deux approches diffèrent considérablement. Dans ce suivi de l'ODD 1.2.2, la pauvreté multidimensionnelle des enfants basée sur la méthodologie MODA est déclarée comme un indicateur supplémentaire et le taux de pauvreté multidimensionnelle est déclaré séparément de la désagrégation de l'indicateur officiel de pauvreté multidimensionnelle des enfants. </p><p>La mesure de la pauvreté implique deux étapes cruciales : (1) l’identification – identifier qui est pauvre, et (2) l’agrégation – compiler les informations de l’individu dans une mesure sommaire. Il existe différentes façons d’effectuer ces deux étapes. Toutes les mesures actuellement estimées par les pays ou les organisations multilatérales utilisent l’approche de comptage. Par conséquent, ce qui suit ne concerne que les approches de comptage, même si d’autres méthodologies qui n'utilisent pas cette approche ont été développées par des experts. </p>\n<p>L’identification et l’agrégation des personnes multidimensionnellement pauvres impliquent les étapes suivantes:</p> <ol>\n  <li>Définir l’ensemble des dimensions pertinentes de la pauvreté et, pour chacune d’entre elles, définir un ensemble d’indicateurs.</li>\n  <li>Pour chaque dimension, déterminer les critères d’évaluation de la privation en fonction des indicateurs.</li>\n  <li>Pour chaque indicateur, définir un seuil de satisfaction, de sorte qu’une personne (ou un ménage) dont la valeur pour cet indicateur est inférieure au seuil sera identifiée comme étant démunie dans cet indicateur.</li>\n  <li>Pour chaque indicateur, comparer la valeur de chaque personne (ou ménage) avec le seuil de satisfaction et créer une variable qui prend, par exemple, la valeur 1 si la personne est privée dans cet indicateur et 0 autrement, puis classer la personne comme démunie ou non dans cet indicateur. </li>\n  <li>Pour chaque personne (ou ménage), faire la somme du nombre de privations. Dans la somme, chaque indicateur peut être pondéré différemment ou également. En règle générale, s’il y a plus d’indicateurs dans une dimension que dans d’autres, les pondérations des indicateurs sont ajustées pour garantir des pondérations égales d’une dimension à l’autre, mais cela ne doit pas nécessairement être le cas.</li>\n  <li>Définir un seuil de pauvreté, de sorte qu’une personne dépassant le seuil sera identifiée et comptée comme pauvre. </li>\n  <li>Compter le nombre de personnes (ou ménages) pour obtenir une mesure de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle pour le pays ou la région d’intérêt. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Pour illustrer cette méthode, supposons une société hypothétique à cinq personnes, où la pauvreté multidimensionnelle est mesurée sur la base de quatre indicateurs : le revenu du ménage par habitant, les années de scolarité, l’accès à un système sanitaire et l’accès à une source d’eau. Les seuils de privation pour ces indicateurs sont, respectivement: 400 unités monétaires (p. ex., dollars, pesos, shillings), 5 ans de scolarité pour les adultes, l’accès à un système sanitaire amélioré et l’accès à des sources d’eau améliorées. Dans cet exemple, les quatre indicateurs sont pondérés de manière égale, et le seuil de pauvreté multidimensionnelle est deux des quatre indicateurs. C’est-à-dire que la personne serait considérée comme pauvre si elle était privée dans au moins deux des quatre indicateurs. Le tableau 1 présente les valeurs des personnes dans chacun des quatre indicateurs, et les seuils de privation sont indiqués dans la rangée du bas. Les valeurs tombant en dessous des seuils de privation sont surlignées en rouge. Le tableau 2 montre le statut de privation de toutes les personnes dans les quatre indicateurs. La colonne (5) montre la somme des privations. En comparant cette somme avec le seuil de pauvreté (comme mentionné ci-dessus, deux sur quatre), les personnes peuvent être classées comme pauvres ou non pauvres, comme indiqué dans la colonne (6). </p>\n<p><strong>Tableau 1.

<p>Non</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>La dernière étape consiste à agréger les informations entre les individus. La mesure récapitulative la plus courante est le taux de dénombrement ou l'incidence de la pauvreté. Le taux de dénombrement est la proportion de la population totale classée comme pauvre. Dans l'exemple ci-dessus, l'incidence de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle est de 60 % (<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mn>3</mn>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mn>5</mn>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n    <mo>&#xD7;</mo>\n    <mn>100</mn>\n  </math>). Tous les exemples empiriques examinés dans cette section utilisent le taux de dénombrement comme mesure de base de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle. D'une part, cette mesure est très intuitive et peut être désagrégée par sous-groupes de population. En revanche, il ne peut pas être décomposé selon les contributions de chaque différent indicateur et il n'est pas sensible au nombre de privations subies par les pauvres. En raison de ces limites, certaines méthodologies proposent d'autres mesures synthétiques en plus du ratio d'effectifs. Aux fins de l'établissement de rapports sur l'indicateur 1.2.2 des ODD, les pays n'ont qu'à calculer le taux d'effectif. </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Besoins fondamentaux non satisfaits</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Les mesures au sujet des besoins fondamentaux non satisfaits, qui ont proliféré en Amérique latine dans les années 1980, sont une application directe de la méthode de comptage<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[1]</a></sup>. Ces mesures utilisent souvent des données de recensement pour produire des cartes détaillées de la pauvreté et elles peuvent également être estimées à l'aide d'enquêtes auprès des ménages. Elles identifient les pauvres en utilisant l'approche de comptage décrite ci-dessus, en suivant toutes les étapes mentionnées, et agrègent les informations sur les ménages et les personnes en utilisant les ratios d'incidence. Plus généralement, la part des ménages ou des individus ayant des besoins de base non satisfaits est présentée pour différents seuils de pauvreté, c'est-à-dire la proportion de ménages et de personnes ayant un ou plusieurs besoins de base non satisfaits, la proportion de ménages et de personnes ayant deux ou plusieurs besoins de base non satisfaits, et ainsi de suite. Les besoins de base pris en compte dans ces mesures comprennent généralement (Feres et Mancero, 2001) : l'accès à un logement répondant aux normes minimales d'habitation, l'accès aux services de base garantissant des conditions sanitaires minimales, l'accès à l'éducation de base et la capacité économique d'atteindre des niveaux de consommation minimaux. Lorsque ces mesures sont estimées à partir des données du recensement, elles peuvent être fortement désagrégées géographiquement, ce qui permet de construire des cartes détaillées de la pauvreté au niveau du district, de la municipalité et même des taux de recensement. En raison de cette propriété, des cartes des besoins fondamentaux non satisfaits ont parfois été utilisées pour répartir les ressources entre les zones. </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Mesure de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle au Mexique</li>\n</ol>\n<p>L'approche par comptage a été utilisée pour évaluer le nombre de personnes qui sont privées simultanément de revenus et de certaines dimensions non monétaires<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[2]</a></sup>. On trouve des premières applications en Irlande et, plus récemment, au Royaume-Uni pour mesurer la pauvreté des enfants<sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-ref-4\">[3]</a></sup>. Mais le premier pays à développer une mesure officielle et permanente de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle dans le monde en développement a été le Mexique. Le « National Council for Evaluation of Social Development Policy » (CONEVAL) a dirigé ce processus. Au Mexique, la pauvreté multidimensionnelle est mesurée dans l'espace du bien-être économique et des droits sociaux, au niveau individuel :</p>\n<p>« Une personne est considérée comme multidimensionnellement pauvre lorsque l'exercice d'au moins un de ses droits sociaux n'est pas garanti et si elle dispose également d'un revenu insuffisant pour acheter les biens et services nécessaires à la satisfaction complète de ses besoins. »((en anglais) <a href=\"https://www.coneval.org.mx/rw/resource/coneval/med_pobreza/MPMMPingles100903.pdf\">CONEVAL, 2010</a>) </p>\n<p><strong>Tableau 3: Dimensions et indicateurs de la mesure de pauvreté multidimensionnelle du Mexique</strong></p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Type de dimension</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Dimension</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Indicateur</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Bien-être économique</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Bien-être économique</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Revenu par habitant</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td rowspan=\"6\">\n        <p>Droits sociaux</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Éducation</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Écart d'éducation (atteinte d'un niveau d'éducation minimum pour leur cohorte d'âge)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Santé</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Inscrit au système de protection sociale de la santé </p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Sécurité sociale</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Accès à la sécurité sociale</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Logement</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Qualité et espaces du logement (sol, toit, murs et surpeuplement)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Services dans le logement</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Accès aux services de base dans le logement (eau, évacuation, électricité, combustible de cuisine)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Nourriture</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Sécurité alimentaire</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Toutes les personnes dont le revenu par habitant est insuffisant pour couvrir les biens et services nécessaires sont considérées comme privées de bien-être économique. Pour les droits sociaux, chacun des six indicateurs du tableau 3 est généré sous forme de variable binaire, 1 représentant la privation et 0 sinon. Dans les cas où il y a plus d'un indicateur, c'est-à-dire pour le logement et l'accès aux services dans le logement, l'individu est classé comme privé s'il n'atteint pas le seuil pour un seul indicateur dans la dimension. L'indice de privation sociale est alors défini comme la somme de ces six indicateurs associés à la privation sociale. Les six dimensions ont la même pondération, car tous les droits de l'homme sont considérés comme d'égale importance. L'indice de privation sociale prend ainsi une valeur comprise entre zéro (la personne n'est privée dans aucun des six indicateurs de droits sociaux) et six (la personne est privée dans tous).</p>\n<p>La classification de la population selon cette méthode est illustrée à la Figure <strong>1</strong>. L'axe vertical représente l'espace du bien-être économique, mesuré par le revenu du ménage par habitant. L'axe horizontal représente l'espace des droits sociaux. Dans cet axe, les individus à l'origine ont un indice de privation sociale de six, les individus placés plus à droite ont moins de privation. Le seuil de privation dans l'espace des droits sociaux est de un, et les individus à gauche de ce seuil ou sur ce seuil sont considérés comme privés de droits sociaux. Les individus sont divisés en quatre groupes  (CONEVAL 2010, p. 32) :</p>\n<ol>\n  <li><em>Multidimensionnellement pauvre</em>. Les personnes dont les revenus sont inférieurs au seuil de bien-être économique et dont un ou plusieurs droits sociaux ne sont pas remplis. </li>\n  <li><em>Vulnérable en raison de la privation sociale</em>. Les personnes socialement privées ayant un revenu supérieur au seuil de bien-être économique. </li>\n  <li><em>Vulnérable en raison du revenu</em>. Les personnes sans privation sociale et avec un revenu inférieur au seuil de bien-être économique .</li>\n  <li><em>Non multidimensionnellement pauvre et non vulnérable</em>. Les personnes ayant un revenu supérieur au seuil de bien-être économique et sans privation sociale. </li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>Figure 1 (en anglais) : Identification des personnes

: Adaptée de CONEVAL (2010).</p>\n<p>Parmi les personnes multidimensionnellement pauvres, celles en extrême pauvreté sont également identifiées, en considérant un seuil de bien-être économique inférieur (le seuil minimum de bien-être économique) <sup><a href=\"#footnote-5\" id=\"footnote-ref-5\">[4]</a></sup> et un seuil de privation plus élevé de trois privations sociales ou plus. </p>\n<p>En termes d'agrégation, le Mexique produit plusieurs catégories de mesures sommaires. La mesure de base est le taux de dénombrement, c'est-à-dire la proportion de personnes souffrant de pauvreté multidimensionnelle (c.-à-d. la proportion de personnes du groupe I dans la figure 1). En outre, d'autres mesures d'effectif sont également déclarées, telles que la proportion de personnes privées de bien-être économique, la proportion privée de chacun des droits sociaux et la proportion présentant une ou plusieurs privations sociales. La profondeur de la pauvreté est calculée séparément en fonction du bien-être économique et des privations sociales. La profondeur de la pauvreté en termes de bien-être économique est l'écart moyen entre le seuil de bien-être et le revenu des personnes pauvres<sup><a href=\"#footnote-6\" id=\"footnote-ref-6\">[5]</a></sup>. Cette mesure est déclarée pour les groupes I et III de la figure 1. La profondeur de la pauvreté en termes de privations sociales est la proportion moyenne de privations parmi les personnes souffrant d'au moins une privation. Cette mesure est déclarée pour les groupes I et II dans la figure 1. Enfin, l'intensité de la pauvreté correspond au produit du taux de dénombrement et de la profondeur de la pauvreté <sup><a href=\"#footnote-7\" id=\"footnote-ref-7\">[6]</a></sup>. Cette mesure est calculée pour les personnes multidimensionnellement pauvres (groupe I) et les personnes socialement privées (groupe II).</p>\n<p>En 2015, le Vietnam a lancé son indice officiel de pauvreté multidimensionnelle, suivant une approche similaire à celle adoptée au Mexique mais utilisant le ménage comme unité d'analyse. Un ménage multidimensionnellement pauvre est un ménage (1) dont le revenu mensuel moyen par habitant est égal ou inférieur au seuil de pauvreté fondé sur le revenu, OU (2) dont le revenu mensuel moyen par habitant est supérieur au seuil de pauvreté fondé sur le revenu mais inférieur au niveau de vie minimum ET est privé dans au moins 3 indices de mesure de la privation d'accès aux services sociaux de base. Dix indicateurs sont inclus dans la liste des services sociaux de base. Ce sont (1) l'éducation des adultes, (2) la scolarisation des enfants, (3) l'accessibilité aux services de soins de santé, (4) l'assurance maladie, (5) la qualité du logement, (6) la surface de logement par habitant, (7) l'approvisionnement en eau potable, (8) les toilettes/latrines hygiéniques, (9) l'utilisation des services de télécommunication et (10) les biens pour l'accessibilité à l'information<sup><a href=\"#footnote-8\" id=\"footnote-ref-8\">[7]</a></sup>.</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>À risque de pauvreté ou d'exclusion sociale</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Depuis 2010, la stratégie économique de l'Union européenne a fixé le grand objectif en matière de pauvreté pour 2020 à « 20 millions de personnes en moins devraient être exposées au risque de pauvreté ». Les progrès par rapport à cet objectif sont mesurés par le taux de personnes menacées de pauvreté ou d'exclusion sociale (<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:At_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion_( AROPE)\">(en anglais)AROPE</a>), défini comme la proportion de personnes qui soit sont à risque de pauvreté monétaire, soit vivent dans un ménage à très faible intensité de travail, soit sont en situation de privation matérielle grave. En d'autres termes, l'AROPE considère trois dimensions/indicateurs, et l'individu est en risque de pauvreté ou d'exclusion sociale s'il est privé d'au moins une de ces dimensions/indicateurs. </p>\n<p>Une personne est <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:At-risk-of-poverty_rate\">(en anglais) à risque de pauvreté</a> si elle :</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>a un revenu disponible équivalent (après transferts sociaux) inférieur à 60 % du revenu disponible équivalent médian national après transferts sociaux. </li>\n  <li>vit dans un ménage à <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Persons_living_in_households_with_low_work_intensity\">(en anglais) très faible intensité de travail</a> (c.-à-d. si le rapport entre le nombre total de mois pendant lesquels tous les membres du ménage en âge de travailler ont travaillé au cours de l'année de référence du revenu et le nombre total de mois qu'ils auraient théoriquement pu travailler est inférieur à 20 %). </li>\n  <li>est en situation de <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Severe_material_deprivation_rate\">(en anglais) privation matérielle grave</a>,ce qui veut dire qu'elle n'a pas les moyens financiers pour au moins quatre des neufs items suivants :</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n  <li>payer le loyer, l'hypothèque ou les factures de services publics </li>\n  <li>garder son logement suffisamment chaud</li>\n  <li>faire face à des dépenses imprévues</li>\n  <li>manger de la viande et des protéines régulièrement</li>\n  <li>aller en vacances</li>\n  <li>un téléviseur</li>\n  <li>une laveuse</li>\n  <li>une automobile</li>\n  <li>un téléphone</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Les informations sur les individus à risque de pauvreté et d'exclusion sociale sont agrégées sous la forme d'un taux d'incidence, soit la proportion d'individus dans la population totale qui sont identifiés comme étant à risque de pauvreté ou d'exclusion sociale.</p>\n<p>La construction d'AROPE suit les mêmes étapes décrites ci-dessus qui sont utilisées pour les besoins fondamentaux non satisfaits ou pour les expériences mixtes (CONEVAL). De plus, comme dans les deux autres cas mis en évidence, les trois dimensions sont équipondérées. Cependant, alors que CONEVAL considère comme démunies de droits sociaux les personnes souffrant d'au moins une privation dans n'importe quel indicateur de cette dimension, l'AROPE exige qu'au sein de la privation matérielle, au moins quatre privations sur neuf soient nécessaires pour établir une privation matérielle grave.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Approche Alkire-Foster de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Alkire et Foster ont présenté une famille de mesures de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle basée sur l'approche de comptage, qui a capté l'attention mondiale et est largement adoptée par les pays. La première et la plus connue des applications est l'indice de pauvreté multidimensionnelle (IPM) de PNUD-OPHI au niveau mondial, qui est publié depuis 2011. Depuis lors, de nombreux pays ont suivi leurs conseils dans ce que l'on appelle « l'approche IPM ».</p> \n<p>La famille de mesures Alkire-Foster suit les cinq étapes des approches de comptage décrites ci-dessus et les deux étapes d'identification et d'agrégation : (1) il y a un premier seuil pour chaque seuil spécifique de privation, et (2) il y a un deuxième seuil à l'étape d'agrégation pour déterminer si la personne (ou le ménage) est multidimensionnellement pauvre sur la base du score de privation. Des poids différentiels sont parfois utilisés au stade de l'agrégation, mais ils ne sont pas obligatoires. Il en résulte une estimation de l'incidence ou de la prévalence de la pauvreté, généralement appelée H.</p> \n<p>Une innovation introduite par la famille de mesures Alkire-Foster est qu'il est possible de tenir compte simultanément de l'incidence de la pauvreté (H) et de son intensité (A)<sup><a href=\"# footnote-9\" id=\"footnote-ref-9\">[8]</a></sup>. L'intensité de la pauvreté – également appelée ampleur de la pauvreté – est définie comme la proportion moyenne des indicateurs de pauvreté multidimensionnelle pertinents (pondérés ou non) pour lesquels les personnes pauvres sont privées. Lors de l'utilisation de variables catégorielles, il est possible d'estimer un taux d'effectif ajusté (<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n<msub>\n<mrow>\n<mi>M</mi>\n</mrow>\n<mrow>\n<mn>0</mn>\n</mrow>\n</msub>\n</math> ou IPM), où </p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n<msub>\n<mrow>\n<mi>M</mi>\n</mrow>\n<mrow>\n<mn>0</mn>\n</mrow>\n</msub>\n<mo>=</mo>\n<mi>H</mi>\n<mo>&#xD7;</mo>\n<mi>A</mi>\n</math><em>.</em></p>\n<p>Le taux d'effectif ajusté, tout comme les autres mesures décrites dans cette note, peut être désagrégé par sous-groupes de population (p. ex., zone géographique, origine ethnique) et il peut être ventilé par dimension ou par indicateur. Pour plus de détails sur la méthodologie, voir Alkire et al. (2015). </p>\n<p>L'approche Alkire-Foster peut être considérée comme un cadre général de mesure de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle qui peut être adapté à des contextes très différents. De nombreuses statistiques nationales permanentes existantes sur la pauvreté multidimensionnelle sont basées sur l'IPM mondial, mais avec des modifications substantielles en termes de dimensions, d'indicateurs et de seuils<sup><a href=\"#footnote-10\" id=\"footnote-ref -10\">[9]</a></sup>. Depuis 2018, la Banque mondiale présente régulièrement des mesures de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle dans tous les pays en utilisant le taux de dénombrement (H), comme le fait la mesure de PNUD-OPHI, bien qu'avec des différences dans la sélection des paramètres, dans certains des indicateurs et dans les sources de données. On retrouve en annexe une comparaison des indicateurs utilisés dans les deux mesures globales. En plus du ratio d'effectif, le rapport 2018 sur la pauvreté et la prospérité partagée, dans lequel la Banque mondiale a introduit cette mesure multidimensionnelle, présente des estimations de la pauvreté mondiale en utilisant le ratio d'effectif ajusté de la famille Alkire-Foster ainsi que la mesure de pauvreté multidimensionnelle sensible à la distribution, proposé dans Datt (2018). </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pauvreté chez les enfants</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Les enfants vivent et souffrent la pauvreté différemment des adultes. Leurs besoins sont également différents, par exemple en termes de nutrition ou d'éducation. Cependant, les enfants sont souvent invisibles dans les estimations de la pauvreté. C'est pourquoi l'ODD 1.2.2 mentionne explicitement les enfants et pourquoi les pays devraient établir une mesure de la pauvreté infantile spécifique aux enfants. La Conférence européenne des statisticiens recommande que les pays « élaborent des mesures de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle spécifiques aux enfants et adaptées au cycle de vie » (recommandation 29). </p>\n<p>Si des mesures de la pauvreté spécifiques aux enfants ne sont pas développées, il y a un risque de mauvaise interprétation de l'évolution de la situation des enfants et par conséquent de mauvaise interprétation de l'impact des politiques et des chocs externes. Il est possible que même si la situation des enfants d'un ménage donné se détériore, ce ménage devienne « non pauvre » en raison d'indicateurs qui ne comptent que pour les adultes. Dans un tel cas, malgré le fait que ces enfants soient moins bien lotis qu'avant, ils ne seraient plus comptés comme pauvres. </p>\n<p>Plus de 70 pays à faible ou à moyen revenu qui ont effectué des analyses de la pauvreté des enfants sur la base d'une mesure spécifique de la pauvreté des enfants utilisent l'enfant comme unité d'analyse. Ces pays se trouvent dans toutes les régions du monde en développement (p. ex., l'Argentine, l'Arménie, le Brésil, l'Égypte, l'Éthiopie, le Mexique, la Sierra Leone, l'Ouganda et la Zambie), ainsi que dans l'Union européenne.</p>\n<p>L'estimation de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle des enfants suit les mêmes étapes que les autres exemples mentionnés ci-dessus : les dimensions pertinentes sont identifiées, les critères d'évaluation de la privation dans chaque dimension sont établis et les enfants privés dans chaque dimension sont identifiés. Un seuil est ensuite spécifié concernant le nombre minimum de dimensions dans lesquelles un enfant doit être privé pour être considéré comme pauvre, et les enfants au-dessus ou en dessous de ce seuil sont alors comptés. De plus, le pourcentage (et le nombre) d'enfants privés dans exactement une, exactement deux, exactement trois, etc., sont déclarés et analysés, ainsi que les chevauchements ou les privations simultanées. Cela permet de mesurer l'incidence, l'ampleur et la sévérité de la pauvreté de manière simple et intégrée.</p>\n<p>Pour la pauvreté des enfants, la sélection des dimensions doit être basée sur les droits de l'enfant. Cependant, tous les droits ne constituent pas la pauvreté des enfants, comme l'expliquent les Lignes directrices sur les droits de l'homme et la pauvreté du Haut-Commissariat aux droits de l'homme. Selon la Conférence des statisticiens européens : « Les mesures de la privation doivent être fondées sur une théorie ou une définition normative claire et explicite de la pauvreté afin de garantir que chaque indicateur est une mesure valide, c.-à-d. qu'il <strong>mesure la pauvreté et non un autre concept apparenté (ou non apparenté) tel que le bien-être ou le bonheur</strong> » (recommandation 28 (a), caractères gras ajoutés).</p>\n<p>Comme dans le cas du CONEVAL (explicitement) et des besoins fondamentaux non satisfaits (implicitement), aucun poids différentiel ne doit être appliqué entre les dimensions car ce sont des droits. Tous les droits ont la même importance et ne peuvent être remplacés. Cela n'émane pas seulement de l'approche des droits de l'homme, mais c'est aussi le cas de l'approche par les capacités, comme l'affirment Dixon et Nussbaum (2012) : « Une approche par les capacités s'engage généralement à la protection égale des droits pour tous jusqu'à un certain seuil. Tout compromis qui laisse certaines personnes en dessous de ce seuil sera donc un échec clair de la justice fondamentale dans le cadre d'une approche par les capacités » (« Children's Rights and a Capabilities Approach: The Question of Special Priority », p. 554, Public Law and Legal Theory, Document de travail N° 384.)</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">1</sup><p>Cette approche a été proposée dans plusieurs publications avant d'être largement adoptée en Amérique latine.

Premièrement, les données sont saisies par le personnel de la Banque mondiale affecté à chaque pays, généralement en consultation avec le BNS du pays et/ou les documents officiels du pays. Ces données sont envoyées aux responsables de pays de l'UNICEF et du PNUD pour validation. Après avoir intégré les contributions de ces trois agences, les données sont envoyées au point focal des ODD de chaque pays pour leur approbation finale. Pour les pays où la Banque mondiale n'a pas de bureau national, comme les pays de l'OCDE et de l'UE, la Banque mondiale a recueilli les informations sur la base des sources de données disponibles en ligne et les a envoyées directement aux homologues officiels de chaque pays pour vérification.</p><p><strong>• Au niveau national :</strong></p>\n<p>Le traitement des valeurs manquantes diffère d'une enquête à l'autre.

Ainsi, les agrégats régionaux et mondiaux ne sont pas produits.</p><p>Une mesure réussie de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle doit être rigoureuse, institutionnalisée, durable et utile. Une telle mesure génère des informations crédibles et pertinentes, et elle est établie comme une statistique permanente officielle aux côtés des statistiques traditionnelles telles que le nombre de personnes pauvres selon le revenu ou les dépenses, et les écarts de pauvreté. Comme pour les autres indicateurs, il est important qu'un système clair et transparent soit en place pour la mise à jour régulière de la mesure. Cela implique que la responsabilité de ces mises à jour est confiée à une entité officielle et que les coûts associés sont intégrés au budget du gouvernement. Idéalement, une mesure de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle pourrait être utilisée activement pour guider l'élaboration des politiques (p. ex., la coordination des politiques, le ciblage et l'évaluation des politiques). </p>\n<p>Pour rendre une telle mesure institutionnelle et utile, il est fondamental que le gouvernement s'approprie le processus. Avoir le soutien de représentants de haut niveau au sein du gouvernement, tels que le président ou le premier ministre, ou des ministres, confère une légitimité supplémentaire au processus et peut faciliter l'adoption de la mesure par d'autres niveaux de gouvernement et parties prenantes. En outre, un fonctionnaire de haut niveau peut être en mesure d'impliquer d'autres acteurs concernés dans le processus de conception et de travailler à l'institutionnalisation de la mesure. La participation active des différents ministères aux discussions et aux décisions tout au long du processus de conception, à savoir la sélection des indicateurs, des seuils respectifs et des pondérations, est essentielle pour garantir que la mesure finale répond aux besoins des décideurs politiques dans un contexte national spécifique.</p>\n<p>Pour rendre une mesure durable plutôt que spécifique à une administration particulière, il est utile de créer un consensus et un sentiment partagé de légitimité autour de la mesure qui transcende les acteurs politiques individuels. Cela exige que le processus d'élaboration de la mesure soit perçu comme crédible, transparent et non partisan. Il est hautement souhaitable d'impliquer les principales parties prenantes, telles que les universitaires, les leaders d'opinion, l'opposition et les représentants de la société civile tout au long du processus. Cela devrait inclure de larges consultations avec le public, par exemple par le biais d'enquêtes représentatives au niveau national pour recueillir le consensus national sur les seuils requis pour satisfaire les différentes dimensions. De plus, il est important d'avoir une stratégie de communication bien conçue pour expliquer le concept et le processus à ces différents acteurs, leur permettant de participer aux discussions sur la conception de la mesure. Certains pays ont opté pour l'implication d'un comité de la pauvreté qui rassemble des experts et des représentants de différents secteurs de la société dans le processus décisionnel de conception de la mesure. </p>\n<p>Plus précisément, la conception d'une mesure de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle implique généralement un processus technique, complété et soutenu par un processus politique. Si des comités techniques et politiques sont mis en place, il est utile de s'entendre sur : (1) un plan d'activités et un calendrier; (2) un calendrier d'interactions régulières pour assurer une bonne communication; et (3) un système de documentation qui garde une trace de toutes les décisions et des justifications respectives. Cependant, l'ingérence politique dans le processus technique doit être évitée, comme le recommande le manuel « National Quality Assurance Frameworks Manual for Official Statistics » de la DSNU.</p><p>Les données ont été validées avec une approche en trois étapes pour assurer leur exactitude. Tout d’abord, les données sont saisies par le personnel de la Banque mondiale affecté à chaque pays, généralement en consultation avec le BNS du pays et/ou les documents officiels du pays.

Ensuite, les données ont été envoyées au PNUD et à l'UNICEF pour une vérification plus approfondie.</p><p><strong>Niveau de désagrégation :</strong></p>\n<p>Le dénombrement officiel de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle (% de la population) est ventilé par sexe et par âge. La tranche d’âge pour le dénombrement officiel de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle chez les enfants est principalement de 0 à 17 ans, mais certains pays ont une définition d’âge différente pour les enfants, comme de 0 à 15 ans au Salvador. Géographiquement, il est ventilé par zones urbaines et rurales. </p>\n<p><strong>Années de déclaration :</strong></p>\n<p>Les années de déclaration pour l'indicateur 1.2.2 des ODD sont celles où l’enquête à la source a été menée, à l’exception de l’AROPE. Lorsque l’année d’enquête est divisée en deux ans, la première année a été déclarée. Dans l’AROPE, la période de référence pour toutes les dimensions ainsi que les indicateurs sont diffusés ainsi que les variables liées aux éléments de privation matérielle en question l’année de l’enquête, à l’exception de l’âge, du revenu, des variables sur les arriérés, de l’intensité du travail du ménage, du pays de naissance et du statut d’activité. En ce qui concerne l’âge, il s’agit de l’âge du répondant à la fin de la période de référence du revenu. Pour le revenu, la période de référence du revenu est une période fixe de 12 mois (telle que l’année civile ou fiscale précédente) pour tous les pays, à l’exception de l’Irlande pour laquelle l’enquête est continue et le revenu est recueilli pour les douze derniers mois. Les variables sur les arriérés se réfèrent aux 12 derniers mois, tandis que l’intensité de travail du ménage fait référence au nombre de mois pendant lesquels tous les membres du ménage en âge de travailler ont travaillé au cours de l’année de référence du revenu. Pour le statut d’activité, l’année de référence est l’année précédant l’année d’enquête et pour le pays de naissance, elle est constante. </p>\n<p><strong>Disponibilité des données :</strong></p>\n<p>Le troisième cycle de suivi de l’ODD 1.2.2 s’est poursuivi d’octobre 2020 à mai 2021.

Toutefois, la disponibilité de l’indicateur multidimensionnel de la pauvreté au fil du temps varie considérablement d’un pays à l’autre. Le tableau suivant montre les années au cours desquelles les données sont disponibles pour un pays (les cases colorées), ainsi que le nombre de statistiques sur les effectifs – population, ménage, hommes, femmes, enfants – disponibles pour chaque pays (selon les différentes couleurs utilisées dans les cases).

sont pas destinées à être comparables entre les pays en raison des différences méthodologiques. Par exemple, bien que la méthodologie AF et AROPE produisent le ratio d'effectif des personnes considérées comme « multidimensionnellement pauvres », leur définition de la multidimensionnalité est différente et ne peut être comparée. En outre, même lorsque les pays utilisent la même approche (p. ex., AF, AROPE ou MODA), les statistiques ne sont pas toujours comparables, car les paramètres clés pour calculer la mesure tels que le nombre d'indicateurs, le poids attribué à chaque indicateur, etc. sont adaptés au contexte spécifique du pays. De plus, dans un même pays, si la méthodologie est différente, les estimations ne doivent pas être comparées. Par exemple, si un pays calcule sa pauvreté multidimensionnelle officielle en utilisant la mesure AF mais la pauvreté multidimensionnelle des enfants en utilisant la méthodologie MODA, les mesures pourraient être très différentes car les dimensions et les indicateurs utilisés dans les deux approches diffèrent considérablement. Dans ce suivi de l'ODD 1.2.2, la pauvreté multidimensionnelle des enfants basée sur la méthodologie MODA est déclarée comme un indicateur supplémentaire et le taux de pauvreté multidimensionnelle est déclaré séparément de la désagrégation de l'indicateur officiel de pauvreté multidimensionnelle des enfants. </p>\n<p><strong>Sources des divergences :</strong></p>\n<p>Le PNUD produit l’Indice mondial de pauvreté multidimensionnelle (IPM), qui est le produit de la multiplication des effectifs multidimensionnels et du nombre moyen de privations en utilisant la même dimension et les mêmes indicateurs couvrant plus de 100 pays. Cependant, la plupart de ces chiffres ne sont pas officiellement approuvés par chaque pays, et parfois l’IPM calculé au niveau national est différent de l’IPM mondial en raison d’une certaine différence des paramètres, par conséquent, dans cette plate-forme, nous ne déclarons pas l’IPM mondial. </p><table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Pays</strong></p>\n
