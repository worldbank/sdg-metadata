			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Within the World Bank, the Transport Global Practice is in charge of the collection and validation of RAI data and results. The Global Practice archives the datasets obtained from NSOs and road agencies and then harmonizes them, applying common methodologies. Where NSOs and road agencies calculate the RAI using their own data and methodologies, the Transport Global Practice is responsible for reviewing the underlying data and assumptions and validating the results for inclusion in the global SDG dataset. The objective is to ensure that the data generated, curated, and disseminated by the World Bank are up to date, meet high-quality standards, and are well documented and consistent across dissemination channels. World Bank country staff works in close collaboration with national statistical authorities on the data collection and dissemination process. &lt;/p&gt;
