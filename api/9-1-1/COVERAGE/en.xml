	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 9-1-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 2019, data is readily available for more than 30 countries, with consultations ongoing for a number more. While data is available for some Asian and Latin American countries as well, Africa accounts for the largest share of the available information. Consultations are underway to engage with additional countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the long update cycle of national road condition surveys, the RAI is not expected to be updated on an annual basis, but instead aligned with national systems. This implies a likely 3-5 year time frame for update. Current data spans the period from 2009-2019, with 1-2 data points per country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to its nature as a geospatially derived indicator, the RAI can be calculated at subnational levels down to the level of granularity of the underlying datasets. While the World Bank will only report country level results for SDG monitoring, subnational results can be calculated for country use.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
