	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources of discrepancies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relying heavily on national data, differences in national systems undoubtedly are reflected in the top level indicator (including road quality classification, national census methodologies, etc.). Use of globally derived datasets such as WorldPop may result in somewhat different results from national data if the NSO has not engaged with WorldPop. However, an assessment of sample countries indicates that these discrepancies are likely limited in their impact of the overall result.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
