	<data>&lt;p&gt;The World Bank, as custodian agency, with support from the UK Department for International Development (DFID) and the Research for Community Access Partnership (ReCAP), has developed and published a full methodological document for the RAI, including detailed descriptions of various data sources, variations on the standard methodology, and a step-by-step guide. In addition, a GIS tool has been developed to calculate the RAI from provided data sets. These resources and others are being collected into an online portal for the Rural Access Index. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
