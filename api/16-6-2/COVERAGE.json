For instance, the <a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/analytics/232838/world-poll.aspx\">Gallup World Poll</a> (not publicly available, but data collected for more than 150 countries) asks people how satisfied they are with education and healthcare public services in their local area. However, the Gallup World Poll questions do not ask specifically about satisfaction <em>with the last experience of public services</em>, and does not refer to specific attributes of public services to be considered by respondents when providing their assessment. </li>\n  <li>At regional level, the Afrobarometer<sup><a href=\"#footnote-22\" id=\"footnote-ref-22\">[21]</a></sup> has collected data on citizens&#x2019; satisfaction with healthcare and education services across Africa over seven survey rounds (from 1999/2001 to 2016/18), using the question &#x201C;<em>How well or badly would you say the current government is handling the following matters, or haven&#x2019;t you heard enough to say: Addressing educational needs?</em> Improving basic health services? with the following answer categories: <em>1=Very badly, 2=Fairly badly, 3=Fairly well, 4=Very well</em>.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-23\" id=\"footnote-ref-23\">[22]</a></sup> </li>\n  <li>Also at the regional (European) level, eight waves of the biennial European Social Survey<sup><a href=\"#footnote-24\" id=\"footnote-ref-24\">[23]</a></sup> (from 2002 to 2016) provide time series data on perception of education and health services in Europe. The relevant survey questions are: <em>What do you think overall about the state of health (education) services in [country] nowadays?</em>, using a scale of 0 (extremely bad) to 10 (extremely good). Once again, these survey questions do not ask specifically about satisfaction <em>with the last experience of public services</em>, and do ask respondents to consider specific attributes of public services when providing their assessment.</li>\n  <li>The fourth edition of the European Quality of Life Survey<sup><a href=\"#footnote-25\" id=\"footnote-ref-25\">[24]</a></sup> (EQLS) in 2016 had a specific focus on the quality of public services, with questions on <em>both </em>overall satisfaction levels with healthcare and education services, <em>and</em> satisfaction with specific attributes of service provision, several of which match the attributes selected for global reporting on 16.6.2. This focus on the quality of public service provision is expected to remain in future iterations of the EQLS survey, and this survey could therefore become an appropriate source of data for reporting on SDG 16.6.2 for 33 participating countries &#x2013; namely the 28 EU Member States and 5 candidate countries (Albania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey).
