Several global and regional sources provide comparable data on some measures of citizen satisfaction with public services: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The <a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/analytics/232838/world-poll.aspx\">Gallup World Poll</a> surveys people&#x2019;s satisfaction with local education and healthcare public services in over 150 countries. However, the Gallup World Poll questions do not ask specifically about satisfaction <em>with the last experience of public services</em>, questions do not refer to specific attributes of public services and data is not publicly available.</li>\n  <li>Since launching its first round in 1999/2001, the <a href=\"https://www.afrobarometer.org/surveys-and-methods/\">Afrobarometer</a><sup><a href=\"#footnote-23\" id=\"footnote-ref-23\">[22]</a></sup> has been collecting data biennially on citizens&#x2019; satisfaction with healthcare and education services in more than 35 countries in Africa. The Afrobarometer, however, also does not ask about specific attributes of public services and does not ask specifically about satisfaction <em>with the last experience of public services</em>.</li>\n  <li>Starting from 2002, the biennial <a href=\"https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/methodology/ess_methodology/survey_specifications.html\">European Social Survey</a><sup><a href=\"#footnote-24\" id=\"footnote-ref-24\">[23]</a></sup> provides time series data on perception of education and health services in Europe. Once again, these survey questions do not ask specifically about satisfaction <em>with the last experience of public services</em> and do not ask respondents to consider specific attributes of public services when providing their assessment.</li>\n  <li>In its 2016 editions, the European Quality of Life Survey<sup><a href=\"#footnote-25\" id=\"footnote-ref-25\">[24]</a></sup> (EQLS) notably introduced questions on specific attributes of service provision in healthcare and education, in additions to questions on overall satisfaction, several of which match the attributes selected for global reporting on 16.6.2. With this focus on the quality of public service provision, this survey could therefore become an appropriate source of data for reporting on SDG 16.6.2 for the 33 participating countries.

For the purpose of this indicator, particular focus is placed on minorities. <em>Minority groups are </em>groups that are numerically inferior to the rest of the population of a state, in a non-dominant position, whose members&#x2014;being nationals of the state&#x2014;possess ethnic, religious or linguistic characteristics differing from those of the rest of the population and show, even if only implicitly, a sense of solidarity directed towards preserving their culture, traditions, religion or language. While the nationality criterion included in the above definition has often been challenged, the requirement to be in a non-dominant position remains important (OHCHR, 2010). Collecting survey data disaggregated by population groups should be subject to the legality of compiling such data in a particular national context and to a careful assessment of the potential risks of collecting such data for the safety of respondents. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-30\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
