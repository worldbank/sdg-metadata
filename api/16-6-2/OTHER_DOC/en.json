This modular &#x2018;add-on&#x2019; technique also allows for the cross-tabulation of satisfaction levels with other socioeconomic variables found in the larger survey, such as the health conditions of the respondent. This enables a more comprehensive analysis of disparities in the provision of services, and helps to pinpoint specific factors that influence satisfaction levels. </li>\n  <li><strong>Target population: </strong>Residents of the country aged 18 or older.</li>\n  <li><strong>Sampling:</strong> As mentioned above, NSOs should strive to incorporate the 16.6.2 batteries of question in large-scale national surveys, also keeping in mind the large sample sizes needed for disaggregation of results by demographic sub-groups and by administrative region. &#x201C;User surveys&#x201D; such as this one, asking respondents to rate their satisfaction level &#x201C;based on their last experience of public services in the past 12 months&#x201D;, may have implications for resources such as time, costs and other resources &#x2013; since large sample sizes are needed to have reliable estimates for the subpopulation of service users. This is because the participation in the survey of some respondents will end when declaring that they have not used healthcare/education/government public services in the past 12 months. Data should be collected on the basis of a nationally representative probability sample of the population residing in private households within the country, irrespective of language, nationality or legal residence status. All private households and all persons aged 18 and over within the household are eligible for the question set. The sampling frame as well as methods of sample selection should ensure that results can be disaggregated at sub-national level, and that every individual and household in the target population is assigned a known probability of selection that is not zero<em> </em>(integrating 16.6.2 batteries in a household survey that targets household heads only should be avoided at all costs).</li>\n  <li><strong>National &#x2018;indigenization&#x2019; of the questionnaire:</strong> Questions can, and should, be &#x2018;indigenized&#x2019; to fit the national context &#x2013; using appropriate terminology. For Q 3, 8 and 13, NSOs can remove inappropriate items from answer choices and incorporate additional ones, as pertinent in the local context.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-31\" id=\"footnote-ref-31\">[30]</a></sup> <em>A copy of the &#x2018;indigenized&#x2019; questionnaire, with a list of all changes made to the base questionnaire, and all translations in local languages, should be shared along with survey results at the time of reporting.</em></li>\n  <li><strong>Randomizing the order of services:</strong> To minimize design effects that may arise from the order in which the battery of questions on education, healthcare or government services is presented to a respondent, the order of these batteries should be randomized, to the extent possible. In other words, some respondents should respond to the battery on healthcare services first, others should respond to the battery on education services first, and others still should respond to the battery on government services first &#x2013; and likewise for the second and third batteries of questions. Regardless of the order, all respondents should respond to all three batteries. It is also recommended that the order of attributes-based questions in each service area be similarly randomized, if possible. </li>\n  <li><strong>Clearly state the reference period:</strong> Past 12 months </li>\n  <li><strong>All answer categories should be read out loud <em>before </em>recording the respondent&#x2019;s answer</strong>, to be sure that the respondent&#x2019;s preferred answer is identified based on all possible options. Showcards with the complete list of answer options could be shown to respondents (while they are being read aloud by the interviewer) for questions that have a long list of answer options. </li>\n  <li><strong>Refer to enumerator instructions for additional guidance on terminology: </strong>Enumerators should refer to the specific definitions and additional guidance provided in the questionnaire if respondents do not understand certain terms or certain questions. To ensure consistency in the way this methodology is applied across countries, enumerator should <em>not </em>try to explain terms in their own terms. </li>\n  <li><strong>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t know&#x201D;, &#x201C;refuse to answer&#x201D; or &#x201C;not applicable&#x201D; should not be read out loud to respondents: </strong>Providing a &#x201C;don&#x2019;t know&#x201D; or &#x201C;refuse to answer&#x201D; option provides an easy way for respondents to avoid engaging with the subject of the question. As such, when respondents say they &#x201C;don&#x2019;t know&#x201D;, enumerators should repeat the question and simply ask them to provide their best guess. The &#x201C;don&#x2019;t know&#x201D; and &#x201C;refuse to answer&#x201D; options should be used only as a last resort.<strong> </strong>Enumerators should use<strong> </strong>separate coding for &#x201C;not applicable&#x201D; (NA &#x2013; 97), &#x201C;don&#x2019;t know&#x201D; (DK &#x2013; 98) and &#x201C;not applicable&#x201D; (NA &#x2013; 99), as indicated in the questionnaire. </li>\n  <li><strong>Rigorous interviewer training</strong> should be carried out to ensure that these guidelines for data collection are uniformly adopted and not potentially affected by other local practices of surveying.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Questionnaire<sup><a href=\"#footnote-32\" id=\"footnote-ref-32\">[31]</a></sup> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I am now going to ask you a few questions about the way public services are provided in [country name]. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Your answers to this survey are important as they will help improve the provision of healthcare, </strong>education and government services<strong> across the country.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Your answers will be confidential.

Dental care and teeth exams are also excluded.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Was there any time <u>during the past 12 months</u> when you (or a child in your household) really needed a medical examination or treatment?</strong></p>\n<p>A.

Refuse to answer</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>The aim of Q1-3 is to assess accessibility to primary healthcare services &#x2013; </strong>i.e. the most basic level of healthcare available to all citizens in a country, provided by a general practitioner, a family doctor or any national health facility providing primary healthcare services. If respondents used hospital services or specialist care services during the past 12 months, such as specialist services provided by a cardiologist, an endocrinologist or an allergist, these experiences should <u>not</u> be considered when responding to Q1-3. </li>\n  <li><strong>Q1-3 focus on <u>public</u> healthcare services</strong> &#x2013; i.e. services that beneficiaries can receive from a government/public health clinic, by a government-employed doctor/nurse, or services that are covered by a public health system. It can also include healthcare services provided by private institutions, as long as such services are provided at reduced (or no) cost to beneficiaries, under a public health system. </li>\n  <li><strong>Respondents who have not had a need for medical examination or treatment in the past 12 months but who are related to a child in their household who needed examination or treatment are invited to respond</strong> to Q1-5 on the basis of their experience as the guardian of a child needing medical examination or treatment. However, respondents must have been <em>personally involved</em> in the care received (or not received) by the child in order to respond to Q1-5. </li>\n  <li>According to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, a <strong>&#x2018;child&#x2019; </strong>is &#x201C;a human being below the age of 18 years unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier&#x201D;.</li>\n  <li><strong>&#x2018;Medical examination&#x2019;</strong> includes regular preventive medical check-ups and diagnostics if those are perceived by the respondent as important. </li>\n  <li><strong>Dental care </strong>is excluded because in many countries, dental care is not covered by publicly funded healthcare systems.</li>\n  <li><strong>&#x201C;... when you <u>really</u> needed...&#x201D;:</strong> The word &#x2018;really&#x2019; is used to ensure that only relevant health problems are taken into account i.e. situations perceived by the respondent as <u>worrying or possibly causing additional health problems or further deteriorating health</u>.
