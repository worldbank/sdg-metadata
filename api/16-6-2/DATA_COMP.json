(NB: questions on education may refer to either primary or secondary education &#x2013; and separate computation of results is recommended for the two levels, resulting in <em>de facto</em> four service areas). Computation involves the computation and reporting of the following three estimates, for each service area:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>The share of respondents who responded positively (i.e. &#x2018;strongly agree &#x2018; or &#x2018;agree&#x2019;) to each of the five attributes questions;</li>\n  <li>The simple average of positive reponses for the five attribute questions combined; and</li>\n  <li>The share of respondents who say they are satisfied (i.e. those who responded &#x2018;very satisfied&#x2019;
