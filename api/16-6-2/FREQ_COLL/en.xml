	<message>The FREQ_COLL field for indicator 16-6-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;To ensure timely capture of changes in levels of citizen satisfaction with public services, NSOs should report data on indicator 16.6.2 at least once every two years. NSOs will need to choose the most appropriate time/period for administering the 16.6.2 batteries of questions. Electoral periods should be avoided, and NSOs should aim for the middle of an electoral term. Experience shows that surveys conducted at the beginning of an electoral term generate more positive responses than surveys conducted at the end of a term. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
