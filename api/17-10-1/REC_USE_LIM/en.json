However, accurate estimates on non-tariff measures or of transparency indicator do not exist.</p>\n<p>To further refine the quality of the information, additional sub-measurements could be calculated including: a) Tariff peaks (i.e. % of tariffs on some products that are considerably higher than usual, defined as above 15 per cent) and b) Tariff escalation (i.e. wherein a country applies a higher tariff rate to products at the later stages of production). These calculations were already provided by ITC as part of the MDG Gap Task Force Report.
