See Annex I and Table A3 in http://www.fao.org/3/i4830e.pdf for a description of the differences. In the future, it is desirable that country would start reporting prevalence estimates using also the internationally set thresholds for moderate or severe and severe levels, in addition to those based on national thresholds.</p>\n<p>FAO is ready to provide assistance on the analytic methods needed to estimate prevalence based on the FIES global reference thresholds.</p>"}
