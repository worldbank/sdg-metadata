In most countries, samples include about 1000 individuals (with larger samples of 3000 individuals in India and 5000 in mainland China).</p>\n<p>Additionally to the GWP, in 2020 FAO collected data in 20 countries through Geopoll&#xAE; with the specific objective of assessing food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic. The countries covered were: Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Haiti, Iraq, Liberia, Mozambique, Myanmar, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa and Zimbabwe. For all these countries, the 2020 assessment was based on Geopoll data.</p>\n<p>Other national surveys exist that already collect FIES compatible data. </p>\n<p>For Afghanistan, Angola, Armenia, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Fiji, Ghana, Greece, Grenada, Honduras, Indonesia, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kyrgyzstan, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritania, Mexico, Morocco, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Palestine, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Saint Lucia, Samoa, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Sudan, Tonga, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, United States of America, Vanuatu, Viet Nam and Zambia, national government survey data were used to calculate the prevalence estimates of food insecurity by applying FAO&#x2019;s statistical methods to adjust national results to the same global reference standard, covering approximately a quarter of the world population. Countries are considered for the year/years when national data are available, informing the regional and subregional aggregates assuming a constant trend in the period 2014&#x2013;2020, or integrating the remaining years with GWP or Geopoll data in case they were compatible. Exceptions to this rule are: Armenia, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Ghana, Honduras, Indonesia, Israel, Malawi, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Uganda and Zambia. In these cases, the following procedure was followed:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Use national data collected in one year to inform the corresponding year.</li>\n  <li>For the remaining years, apply the smoothed trend coming from the data collected by FAO through the Gallup&#xA9; World Poll to the national data to describe evolution over time. Smoothed trend is computed by taking the mean of the rates of change between consecutive three-year averages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The motivation behind this procedure was the strong evidence found in support of the trend suggested by data collected by FAO (for instance, evolution of poverty, extreme poverty, employment, food inflation, among others), allowing to provide a more updated description of the trend in the period 2014&#x2013;2020.</p>\n<p>In Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mauritania, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Rwanda, Seychelles, Sudan and United Republic of Tanzania, due to lack of data in 2020, the corresponding subregional trend between 2019 and 2020 was used to inform 2020.</p>\n<p><u>Obtaining internationally comparable data for global monitoring:</u></p>\n<p>To ensure comparability of the FImod+sev and FIsev indicators computed for different populations, universal thresholds are defined on the FIES global reference scale and converted into corresponding values on the &#x201C;local&#x201D; scales obtained as a result of application of the Rasch model on any specific population, through a process of &#x201C;equating&#x201D;.</p>\n<p>Equating is a form of standardization of the metric based on identification of the subset of items that can be considered common to the global FIES and the specific scale used for measurement in each context. The severity levels associated with the common items are used as anchoring points to adjust the global FIES thresholds to the local scales. The standardization process ensures that the mean and standard deviation of the set of common items is the same when measured on the global FIES or on the national scale. Compatibility with the global FIES and the possibility to compile this indicator requires that at least four of the eight FIES items are identified as common.</p>\n<p>The Statistics Division at FAO has developed the RM.weights package under R, which provides routines for estimating the parameters of the Rasch model using conditional maximum likelihood, with the possibility to allow for the complex survey design.</p>"}
