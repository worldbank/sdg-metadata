	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 2-1-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;An average of less than three minutes of survey time is estimated to collect FIES data in a well-conducted face-to-face survey, which should make it possible to include the FIES-SM in a nationally representative survey in every country in the world, at a very reasonable cost. FAO provides versions of the FIES-SM adapted and translated in each of the more than 200 languages and dialects used in the Gallup World Poll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When used in the Gallup World Poll, with sample sizes of only about 1000 individuals, the width of confidence intervals rarely exceeds 20% of the measured prevalence (that is, prevalence rates of around 50% are estimated with margins of errors of plus or minus 5%). Obviously, confidence intervals are likely to be much smaller when national prevalence rates are estimated using larger samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to other proposed non-official indicators of household food insecurity, the FIES based approach has the advantage that food insecurity prevalence rates are directly comparable across population groups and countries. Even if they use similar labels (such as &amp;#x201C;mild&amp;#x201D;, &amp;#x201C;moderate&amp;#x201D; and &amp;#x201C;severe&amp;#x201D; food insecurity) other approaches have yet to demonstrate the formal comparability of the thresholds used for classification, due to lack of the definition of a proper statistical model that links the values of the &amp;#x201C;indexes&amp;#x201D; or &amp;#x201C;scores&amp;#x201D; used for classification, to the severity of food insecurity. For this reason, care should be taken when comparing the results obtained with the FIES with those obtained with these other indicators, even if, unfortunately, similar labels are used to describe them.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
