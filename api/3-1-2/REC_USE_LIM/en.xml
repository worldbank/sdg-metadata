	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 3-1-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Births attended by skilled health personnel is an indicator of health care utilization. It is a measure of the health system&amp;#x2019;s functioning and potential to provide adequate coverage for childbirth. On its own, however, this indicator does not provide insight into the availability or accessibility of services, for example in cases where emergency care is needed. Neither does this indicator capture the quality of care received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data collection and data interpretation in many countries is challenged by lack of guidelines, standardization of professional titles and functions of the health care provider, and in some countries by task-shifting. In addition, many countries have found that there are large gaps between international standards and the competencies of existing health care professionals providing childbirth care. Lack of training and an enabling environment often hinder evidence-based management of common obstetric and neonatal complications.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
