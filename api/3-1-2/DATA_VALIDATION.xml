			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;As part of the data harmonization process an annual country consultation conducted by UNICEF. Country inputs are reviewed and assessed jointly with WHO. During the process SDG country focal points are contacted for updating and verifying values included in the database and obtaining new sources of data. The national categories of skilled health personnel are verified, and the estimates for some countries may include additional categories of trained personnel beyond doctor, nurse, and midwife. This process serves as validation of the reported values. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, with regard to data obtained from surveys, the validity of such data depends on the correct identification by the women of the credentials of the person attending the delivery, which may not be obvious in certain countries.&lt;/p&gt;
