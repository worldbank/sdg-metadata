	<data>&lt;p&gt;Definition of skilled health personnel varies between countries. The proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel is calculated as the number of births attended by skilled health personnel (doctors, nurses or midwives) expressed as a proportion of the number of live births in the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In household surveys, such as DHS, MICS and RHS, the respondent is asked about the most recent birth and who helped during childbirth for a period up to five years before the interview. For consistency of reporting, survey customization teams in country are encouraged to review categories or occupational title of health care providers reported on the previous surveys and ensure comparability. Service/facility records could be used where a high proportion of births occur in health facilities and are recorded. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
