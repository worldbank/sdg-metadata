&lt;p&gt;As part of the data harmonization process an annual country consultation process is conducted by UNICEF. Country inputs are reviewed and assessed jointly with WHO. During the process, SDG country focal points are contacted for updating and verifying values included in the data bases and obtaining new sources of data. The national categories of skilled health personnel are verified, and the reported data for some countries may include additional categories of trained personnel beyond doctor, nurse, and midwife.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
