	<data>&lt;p&gt;UNICEF and WHO maintain a joint database on SDG 3.1.2: &amp;#x201C;Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel&amp;#x201D; and collaborate to ensure quality and consistency of data sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the data harmonization process and interaction with countries, an annual country consultation is conducted by UNICEF. During the country consultation, SDG country focal points are contacted for updating and verifying values included in the database and for obtaining new data sources. New data sources are reviewed and assessed jointly with WHO. As part of the process, the national categories or occupational titles of skilled health personnel are verified. The reported data for some countries may include additional categories of trained personnel beyond doctor, nurse and midwife. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</data>
