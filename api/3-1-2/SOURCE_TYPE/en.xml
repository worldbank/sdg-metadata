	<message>The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 3-1-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;National-level household surveys are the main data sources used to collect data for skilled health personnel providing childbirth care. These surveys include Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS) and other national surveys based on similar methodologies. In these surveys the respondent is asked about the last live birth and who helped during delivery for a period up to five years before the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surveys are undertaken every three to five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Population-based surveys are the preferred data source in countries with a low utilization of childbirth services, where private sector data are excluded from routine data collection, and/or with weak health information systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Routine service/facility records are a more common data source in countries where a high proportion of births occur in health facilities and are therefore recorded. These data can be used to track the indicator on an annual basis.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
