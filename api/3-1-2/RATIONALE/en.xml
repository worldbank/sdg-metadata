	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 3-1-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Having a skilled health care provider at the time of childbirth is an important lifesaving intervention for both women and newborns. Not having access to this key assistance is detrimental to women&amp;apos;s and newborns&amp;#x2019; health because it could cause the death of the women and/or the newborns or long lasting morbidity. Achieving universal coverage for this indicator is therefore essential for reducing maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
