	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data availability: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data are available for over 170 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lag between the reference year and actual production of data series depends on the availability of the household survey for each country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time series:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2000-2020 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disaggregation: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this indicator, when data are reported from household surveys, disaggregation is available for various socio-economic characteristics including age of the mother, residence (urban/rural), household wealth (quintiles), education level of the mother, maternal age, geographic regions. When data are reported from administrative sources, disaggregation is more limited and tend to include only residence. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
