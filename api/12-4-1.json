The reports are to contain, inter alia, information regarding transboundary movements of hazardous wastes or other wastes in which Parties have been involved, including the amount of hazardous wastes and other wastes exported, their category, characteristics, destination, any transit country and disposal method as stated on the response to notification, the amount of hazardous wastes and other wastes imported in their category, characteristics, origin, and disposal methods; information on accidents occurring during the transboundary movement and disposal of hazardous wastes and other wastes and on the measures undertaken to deal with them; information on disposal options operated within the area of their national jurisdiction; and other information as per reporting format.</p>\n<p>Import responses under the <strong>Rotterdam Convention</strong> are the decisions provided by Parties indicating whether or not they will consent to import the chemicals listed in Annex III of the Convention and subject to the prior informed consent (PIC) procedure. Article 10 of the Rotterdam Convention sets out the obligations of Parties with respect to the future import of chemicals listed in Annex III.</p>\n<p>Under the <strong>Stockholm Convention</strong>, a Party has an obligation to report on the measures it has taken to implement the provisions of the Convention and on the effectiveness of such measures in meeting the objectives of the Convention. The national reports include statistical data on the total quantities of production, import and export of each of the chemicals listed in Annex A and Annex B or a reasonable estimate of such data; and to the extent practicable, a list of the States from which it has imported each substance and the States to which it has exported each substance. A National Implementation Plan under the Stockholm Convention is a plan explaining how a Party is going to implement the obligations under the Convention and make efforts to put such a plan into operation (<a href=\"http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/Repository/conf/UNEP-POPS-CONF-4-AppendixII.5206ab9e-ca67-42a7-afee-9d90720553c8.pdf#Article%207\">Article 7</a>). Changes in the obligations arising from amendments to the Convention or its annexes, for example when a new chemical is listed into the annexes of the Convention, will require that a Party is to review and update its implementation plan, and transmit the updated plan to the Conference of the Parties (COP) within two years of the entry into force of the amendment for it, consistent with paragraph 1 (b) of the Convention (according to paragraph 7 of the annex to decision SC-1/12). </p>\n<p>The <strong>Minamata Convention</strong> requires, under its article 17, paragraph 4, that each Party designates a National Focal Point for the exchange of information under it, including with regard to the consent of importing Parties under Article 3. Pursuant to Article 21 of the Minamata Convention, each party to the Convention shall report to the COP on the measures it has taken to implement the provisions of the Convention, on the effectiveness of such measures and on possible challenges in meeting the objectives of the Convention. In decision MC-1/8 on the Timing and format of reporting by the Parties, the COP at its first meeting (2017) agreed on the full format of reporting and decided that each Party shall report every four years using the full format and report every two years on four questions marked by an asterisk in the full format. The COP further decided on the following timing with regards to the short and full reporting: 31 December 2019 as the deadline for the first short national report; 31 December 2021 as the deadline for the first full national report. </p>\n<p>The <strong>Montreal Protocol</strong> requires, under its Article 7, that each Party provides to the Secretariat for each controlled substance statistical data on its annual production, amounts used for feedstocks, amounts destroyed by technologies approved by the Parties, imports from and exports to Parties and non-Parties respectively and amount of the controlled substance listed in Annex E used for quarantine and pre-shipment applications, for the year during which provisions concerning those substances entered into force for that Party and for each year thereafter. Each Party shall also provide to the Secretariat statistical data on its annual emissions of trifluoromethane (HFC-23) per facility. The calculation of control levels is provided in Article 3 of the Protocol. This reporting enables monitoring of the implementation of the Protocol, and compliance with the control measures under the protocol. Additionally, under Article 4B, each party is required to establish and implement a system for licensing the import and export of new, used, recycled and reclaimed controlled substances. Each Party is required, within three months of the date of introducing its licensing system, to report to the Secretariat on the establishment and operation of that system. </p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">1</sup><p><sup> </sup> The parameters presented below are based on the obligations of the Parties to transmit information to the Secretariat, whatever its national circumstances.

Parties also have an obligation to inform the Secretariat of any changes regarding designations made by them. The Conference of the Parties (COP) has adopted a standard form for notification of designation of contacts (decision BC-11/21), which Parties are requested to use to transmit information to the Secretariat including modifications. </p>\n<p>A list of competent authorities and focal points to the Basel Convention is maintained and regularly updated on <a href=\"http://www.basel.int/Countries/CountryContacts/tabid/1342/Default.aspx\">the Convention website</a>.</p>\n<p>To enable monitoring of the implementation of the Basel Convention by its Parties and to present reports on this matter to the COP on a regular basis, the Convention establishes a mechanism for Parties to transmit information about implementation of the Convention. According to Article 13, the Parties, consistent with national laws and regulations, shall transmit, through the Secretariat, to the COP established under Article 15, before the end of each calendar year<strong><u>, a report</u></strong> on the previous calendar year.</p>\n<p>Article 13 mandates the Secretariat to receive and disseminate this and other types of information.</p>\n<p><strong>Rotterdam Convention:</strong> Pursuant to Article 4 of the Rotterdam Convention, each Party is required to designate one or more national authorities that shall be authorized to act on its behalf in the performance of the administrative functions required by the Convention. The Secretariat also communicates with an Official Contact Point (OCP) of a Party on official issues. Here too, the COP has adopted a standard form for notification of designation of contacts (decision RC-6/13), which Parties are requested to use to transmit information to the Secretariat. A contacts database is available on <a href=\"http://www.pic.int/Countries/CountryContacts/tabid/3282/language/en-US/Default.aspx\">the Rotterdam Convention website</a>. </p>\n<p>Article 10 of the Convention sets out the obligations of Parties with respect to the future import of chemicals listed in Annex III. Parties have an ongoing obligation to submit to the Secretariat, as soon as possible and in any event no later than nine months after the date of dispatch of a decision guidance document, their <strong><u>import response</u></strong><sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[2]</a></sup> (whether a final or interim response) concerning the future import of the chemical. If a Party modifies its response, it has an obligation to immediately submit the revised response to the Secretariat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Article 14 in addition to other relevant Articles gives the mandate to the Secretariat to facilitate the information exchange. The Secretariat maintains various databases of information on the Convention website based on transmissions from Parties e.g. country profiles, database of import responses, national legislation collection.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Stockholm Convention:</strong> Pursuant to Article 9 of the Stockholm Convention, each Party shall designate a national focal point for the exchange of the information referred to in paragraph 1 of article 9. Pursuant to decision <a href=\"http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/download.aspx?d=UNEP-POPS-COP.2-SC-2-16.English.PDF\">SC-2/16</a> of the second meeting of the COP of the Stockholm Convention, Parties are invited to nominate OCPs. A revised harmonised form for notification of designation of contacts has also been adopted by the COP to the Stockholm Convention for notification of contacts, including modifications (decision SC-6/26). The Secretariat also maintains for this <a href=\"http://chm.pops.int/Countries/CountryContacts/tabid/304/Default.aspx\">Convention a database of country contacts</a>.</p>\n<p>Parties to the Stockholm Convention are required to develop, endeavour to implement, update and review as appropriate, a plan explaining how they are going to implement the obligations under the Convention (Article 7) (&#x201C;national implementation plans&#x201D;). The plans are made available on the Convention website. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, Article 9 specifies that the Parties facilitate or undertake the exchange of information relevant to the reduction or elimination of the production, use and release of persistent organic pollutants and alternatives to them directly or through the Secretariat. </p>\n<p>A national report contains information on the measures taken by a Party in implementing the Stockholm Convention. The information provided in the national reports is one of the main references to be used for the evaluation of the effectiveness of the Convention in accordance with its Article 16. The COP decided at its first meeting that <strong><u>national reports</u></strong> shall be submitted every four years. The OCP has the authority to submit a national report to the Secretariat.</p>\n<p><strong>Minamata Convention:</strong> Parties requested the Secretariat of the Minamata Convention to facilitate cooperation in the exchange of information referred to in Article 17, including with respect to the designation of national focal points, pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article 17 of the Minamata Convention. Article 24 of the Convention further includes in the functions of the Secretariat, <em>inter alia</em>, to assist Parties in the exchange of information related to the implementation of the Convention, and to prepare and make to the Parties periodic reports based on information received pursuant to Article 21.</p>\n<p><strong>Montreal Protocol:</strong> Under the Montreal Protocol, the role of the Secretariat is stipulated in Article 12 of the Protocol including the obligation to receive data provided pursuant to Article 7. Additionally, under Article 4B, each Party is required, within three months of the date of introducing its licensing system, to report to the Secretariat on the establishment and operation of that system. </p>\n<p>Compliance of the Parties with their reporting obligations is considered by an Implementation Committee established under the Protocol&#x2019;s Non-Compliance Procedure and is determined by the Meeting of the Parties based on the Committee&#x2019;s recommendations (<a href=\"https://ozone.unep.org/list-of-implementation-committee-recommendations\">https://ozone.unep.org/list-of-implementation-committee-recommendations</a>).</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-3\">2</sup><p> The import response may consist of an interim response that is not necessarily a decision, see for example Article 10(4)(b)(ii)-(iv). <a href=\"#footnote-ref-3\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div><p>The proposed indicator is process-oriented, focusing on compliance with the obligations that contribute to the overall target of achieving the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle. </p>\n<p>It does not measure the quantity of chemicals in media and does not quantify adverse impacts on human health and the environment. The MEAs, however, were developed and adopted to address the most urgent challenges for human health and the environment and therefore, through the implementation of MEAs progress will be made to reduce release to air, water and soil as well as presence of hazardous chemicals in products. </p><p>The transmission of information as required by the five Conventions follows a different timing. This is the reason why the reporting to this indicator has been scheduled for 5-year cycles, which would allow capturing the compliance of Parties with the transmission of information of all the Conventions.</p>\n<p>Please also note that the timing for submission of reporting for the Minamata Convention has been agreed upon under decision MC-1/8, with the deadlines for the short and full reporting: 31 December 2019 as the deadline for the first short national report and 31 December 2021 as the deadline for the first full national report. Based on the prescribed deadlines, it therefore follows that for the first short reports the reporting period covers 16 August 2017 (the date of entry into force of the Convention) to 31 December 2018 (to be submitted by 31 December 2019), and for the first full reports the reporting period covers 16 August 2017 to 31 December 2020 (to be submitted by 31 December 2021). The cycle will then be repeated, with the subsequent short reports covering 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2022 and the subsequent full reports covering 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2024, and so on.</p><p>In the following methodology, reporting is to take place in 2017 for the period 2010-2014, in 2020 for the period 2015-2019, in 2025 for the period 2020-2024 and in 2030 for the period 2025-2029.

The Secretariat drafted guidance for the short reports (4 questions) to assist Parties. In decision MC-3/13, on guidance for completing the national reporting format, the COP, recognized the need for a complete and consistent national reporting to provide information for the effectiveness evaluation and for supporting compliance, and requested the secretariat to prepare draft guidance for the full national reporting format to clarify the information being sought. A draft of the Guidance was circulated on 20 May 2021, and has been provisionally used to inform the completion of the first full national reports due by 31 December 2021. The draft guidance is under consideration at the fourth meeting of the COP of the Minamata Convention in March 2022. .

El artículo 10 del Convenio de Rotterdam establece las obligaciones de las Partes con respecto a la futura importación de productos químicos incluidos en el Anexo III.</p>\n</p> En virtud del Convenio de Estocolmo, las Partes tienen la obligación de informar sobre las medidas que han adoptado para aplicar las disposiciones del Convenio y sobre la eficacia de dichas medidas para cumplir los objetivos del Convenio. Los informes nacionales incluyen datos estadísticos sobre las cantidades totales de producción, importación y exportación de cada uno de los productos químicos enumerados en el anexo A y el anexo B o una estimación razonable de esos datos; y, en la medida de lo posible, una lista de los Estados de los que ha importado cada una de esas sustancias y de los Estados a los que ha exportado cada una de ellas. El Plan Nacional de Aplicación del Convenio de Estocolmo es un plan que explica cómo una Parte va a cumplir las obligaciones del Convenio y se esfuerza por poner en marcha dicho plan (<a href=\"http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/Repository/conf/UNEP-POPS-CONF-4-AppendixII.5206ab9e-ca67-42a7-afee-9d90720553c8.pdf#Article%207\">Article 7</a>). Los cambios en las obligaciones derivados de las enmiendas al Convenio o a sus anexos, por ejemplo, cuando se incluya un nuevo producto químico en los anexos del Convenio, una Parte revisará y actualizará su plan de aplicación, y transmitirá el plan actualizado a la Conferencia de las Partes en un plazo de dos años a partir de la entrada en vigor de la enmienda para ella, en consonancia con el apartado b) del párrafo 1 del Convenio (según el párrafo 7 del anexo de la decisión SC-1/12). </p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">2</sup><p><sup> </sup> Los parámetros presentados a continuación se basan en las obligaciones de las Partes de transmitir información a la Secretaría, independientemente de sus circunstancias nacionales.
