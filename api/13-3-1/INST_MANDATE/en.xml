	<message>The INST_MANDATE field for indicator 13-3-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;In 1974, UNESCO Member States adopted the &lt;em&gt;Recommendation concerning Education for International Understanding, Co-operation and Peace and Education relating to Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms&lt;/em&gt;, which encapsulates many of the aims of SDG targets 4.7, 12.8 and 13.3. Every four years, countries report on the implementation of the Recommendation. This well-established formal mechanism is the data source for indicator 4.7.1/12.8.1/13.3.1. The seventh quadrennial reporting round took place in 2020-2021.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
