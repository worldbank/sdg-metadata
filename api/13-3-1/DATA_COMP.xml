			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Information collected with the questionnaire for monitoring the implementation by UNESCO Member States of the 1974 &lt;em&gt;Recommendation concerning Education for International Understanding, Co-operation and Peace and Education relating to Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms&lt;/em&gt; is used for the construction of the global indicator. For each of the four components of the indicator (policies, curricula, teacher education, and student assessment), a number of criteria are measured, which are then combined to give a single score between zero and one for each component. Only information for primary and secondary education will be used for calculation of indicator 4.7.1/12.8.1/13.3.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Laws and policies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following questions are used to calculate the policies component of the indicator:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A2: Please indicate which GCED and ESD themes are covered in national or sub-national &lt;u&gt;laws, legislation or legal frameworks&lt;/u&gt; on education. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are eight GCED/ESD themes (cultural diversity and tolerance, gender equality, human rights, peace and non-violence, climate change, environmental sustainability, human survival and well-being, and sustainable consumption and production) and two levels of government (national and sub-national) = 16 responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Response categories are no = 0, yes = 1, unknown, which is treated as zero, and not applicable, which is ignored. Blanks are also treated as zeros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If more than half of responses are unknown or blank the question score is not calculated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that &amp;#x2018;not applicable&amp;#x2019; is used where only one level of government is responsible for education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question score = simple mean of the 0 and 1 scores, &lt;u&gt;excluding not applicables &lt;/u&gt;(i.e., if eight of the 16 responses are &amp;#x2018;not applicable&amp;#x2019;, the sum of the 0 and 1 scores is divided by 8 to get the mean and not by 16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A4. Please indicate which GCED and ESD themes are covered in national or sub-national &lt;u&gt;education policies, frameworks or strategic objectives&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are eight GCED/ESD themes (cultural diversity and tolerance, gender equality, human rights, peace and non-violence, climate change, environmental sustainability, human survival and well-being, and sustainable consumption and production) = 8 responses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Response categories are no = 0, yes = 1, and unknown (treated as zero. Blanks are also treated as zeros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If more than half of responses are unknown or blank, the question score is not calculated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question score = simple mean of the 0 and 1 scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A5. Please indicate whether national or sub-national &lt;u&gt;education policies, frameworks or strategic objectives&lt;/u&gt; on education provide a mandate to integrate GCED and ESD. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two levels of government (national, sub-national) and five areas of integration (curricula, learning objectives, textbooks, teacher education, and student assessment) = 10 responses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Response categories are no = 0, yes = 1, unknown (treated as zero), and not applicable, which is ignored. Blanks are also treated as zeros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If more than half of responses &lt;u&gt;excluding not applicables&lt;/u&gt; are unknown or blank, the question score is not calculated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that &amp;#x2018;not applicable&amp;#x2019; is used where only one level of government is responsible for education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question score = simple mean of the 0 and 1 scores, &lt;u&gt;excluding not applicables &lt;/u&gt;(i.e., if five of the 10 responses are &amp;#x2018;not applicable&amp;#x2019;, the sum of the 0 and 1 scores is divided by 5 to get the mean and not by 10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E1a. Based on your responses to questions in the previous section (laws and policies) please indicate to what extent global citizenship education (GCED) and education for sustainable development (ESD) are mainstreamed&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-2&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in education laws and policies in your country.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two levels of government (national, sub-national) = 2 responses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Response categories are not at all = 0, partially = 1, extensively = 2, unknown (treated as zero), and not applicable, which is ignored. Blanks are also treated as zeros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If more than half of responses &lt;u&gt;excluding not applicables&lt;/u&gt; are unknown or blank, the question score is not calculated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that &amp;#x2018;not applicable&amp;#x2019; is used where only one level of government is responsible for education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question score = half the simple mean of the 0, 1 and 2 scores, &lt;u&gt;excluding not applicables &lt;/u&gt;(i.e., if one of the two responses is &amp;#x2018;not applicable&amp;#x2019;, the sum of the 0, 1 and 2 scores is divided by 2 to get half the mean and not by 4). The score is half the mean in order to ensure it lies between 0 and 1 as do the scores for the other three questions in this section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy component score = simple mean of the scores for questions A2, A4, A5 and E1a. Where a question score could not be calculated because too many responses were unknown or blank, the component score is not calculated and is reported as not available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Curricula&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Response categories are no = 0, yes = 1, and unknown, which is treated as zero. Blanks are also treated as zeros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If more than half of responses are unknown or blank the question score is not calculated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that responses to &amp;#x2018;other subjects, please specify&amp;#x2019; in the question are ignored. If appropriate, during quality assurance answers in this category may be recoded to one of the other 12 subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E1b. Based on your responses to questions in the previous section (curricula) please indicate to what extent global citizenship education (GCED) and education for sustainable development (ESD) are mainstreamed&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-3&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-3&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in curricula in your country.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Response categories are not at all = 0, partially = 1, extensively = 2, unknown (treated as zero), and not applicable (which is ignored). Blanks are also treated as zeros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If more than half of responses &lt;u&gt;excluding not applicables&lt;/u&gt; are unknown or blank, the question score is not calculated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that &amp;#x2018;not applicable&amp;#x2019; is used where only one level of government is responsible for education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question score = half the simple mean of the 0, 1 and 2 scores, &lt;u&gt;excluding not applicables &lt;/u&gt;(i.e., if one of the two responses is &amp;#x2018;not applicable&amp;#x2019;, the sum of the 0, 1 and 2 scores is divided by 2 to get half the mean and not by 4).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;D2: Please indicate whether the GCED and ESD themes below are generally included in &lt;u&gt;student assessments or examinations&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are eight GCED/ESD themes (cultural diversity and tolerance, gender equality, human rights, peace and non-violence, climate change, environmental sustainability, human survival and well-being, and sustainable consumption and production) = 8 responses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Response categories are no = 0, yes = 1 and unknown, which is treated as zero. Blanks are also treated as zeros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If more than half of responses are unknown or blank, the question score is not calculated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question score = simple mean of the 0 and 1 scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;D3. Please indicate which of the dimensions of learning in GCED and ESD below are generally included in &lt;u&gt;student assessments or examinations&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Response categories are no = 0, yes = 1 and unknown, which is treated as zero. Blanks are also treated as zeros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If more than half of responses are unknown or blank, the question score is not calculated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question score = simple mean of the 0 and 1 scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E1d. Based on your responses to questions in the previous section (student assessment), please indicate to what extent global citizenship education (GCED) and education for sustainable development (ESD) are mainstreamed&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-5&quot; id=&quot;footnote-ref-5&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in student assessment in your country.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two levels of government (national, sub-national) = 2 responses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Response categories are not at all = 0, partially = 1, extensively = 2, unknown (treated as zero), and not applicable, which is ignored. Blanks are also treated as zeros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If more than half of responses &lt;u&gt;excluding not applicables&lt;/u&gt; are unknown or blank, the question score is not calculated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that &amp;#x2018;not applicable&amp;#x2019; is used where only one level of government is responsible for education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question score = half the simple mean of the 0, 1 and 2 scores, &lt;u&gt;excluding not applicables &lt;/u&gt;(i.e., if one of the two responses is &amp;#x2018;not applicable&amp;#x2019;, the sum of the 0, 1 and 2 scores is divided by 2 to get half the mean and not by 4). The score is half the mean in order to ensure it lies between 0 and 1, as do the scores for the other three questions in this section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Student assessment component score = simple mean of the scores for questions D2, D3 and E1d. Where component question score could not be calculated because too many responses were unknown or blank, the component score is not calculated and is reported as not available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The component scores all lie between zero and one and are presented as a dashboard of four scores. They are not combined to create a single overall score for the indicator. The higher the score, the more GCED and ESD are mainstreamed in the given component. In this way, users can make a simple assessment in which component area more efforts may be needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-2&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; GCED and ESD are mainstreamed if they or their themes and sub-themes are mentioned explicitly in relevant documents and are expected to be implemented by the relevant authorities (e.g. Ministries, regional or local education authorities), educational institutions (e.g. schools, colleges and universities), and/or education professionals (e.g. teachers and lecturers), as appropriate. &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-2&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-3&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; GCED and ESD are mainstreamed if they or their themes and sub-themes are mentioned explicitly in relevant documents and are expected to be implemented by the relevant authorities (e.g. Ministries, regional or local education authorities), educational institutions (e.g. schools, colleges and universities), and/or education professionals (e.g. teachers and lecturers), as appropriate. &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-3&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-4&quot;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; GCED and ESD are mainstreamed if they or their themes and sub-themes are mentioned explicitly in relevant documents and are expected to be implemented by the relevant authorities (e.g. Ministries, regional or local education authorities), educational institutions (e.g. schools, colleges and universities) and/or education professionals (e.g. teachers and lecturers), as appropriate. &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-4&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-number&quot; id=&quot;footnote-5&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; GCED and ESD are mainstreamed if they or their themes and sub-themes are mentioned explicitly in relevant documents and are expected to be implemented by the relevant authorities (e.g. Ministries, regional or local education authorities), educational institutions (e.g. schools, colleges and universities) and/or education professionals (e.g. teachers and lecturers) as appropriate. &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-ref-5&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2191;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
