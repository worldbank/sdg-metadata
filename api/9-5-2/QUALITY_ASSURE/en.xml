	<message>The QUALITY_ASSURE field for indicator 9-5-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The process of quality assurance includes review of survey documentations/metadata, examination of reliability of data, make sure they comply with international standards (including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - OECD Frascati Manual), and examine the consistency and coherence within the data set as well as with the time series of data and the resulting indicators. During the data processing stage, for each questionnaire received from countries where the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) sends questionnaire to, the above quality aspects are looked into and a data report is produced identifying problematic issues/inconsistent data for each respective country. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) sends such data reports, including the calculated indicators for target 9.5, providing the countries with the opportunity to review the data/indicators and submit any clarifications or modifications/additions before releasing data at the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) Data Centre and submitting the data to UN Statistics Division for inclusion in the global SDG Indicators Database.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
