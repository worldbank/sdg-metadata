Tasks at this level require respondents to make matches between the text and information, and may require paraphrasing or low-level inferences. Some competing pieces of information may be present. Some tasks require the respondent to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>cycle through or integrate two or more pieces of information based on criteria;</li>\n  <li>compare and contrast or reason about information requested in the question; or</li>\n  <li>navigate within digital texts to access and identify information from various parts of a document.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Numeracy:</strong></p>\n<p>Tasks at this level require the respondent to identify and act on mathematical information and ideas embedded in a range of common contexts where the mathematical content is fairly explicit or visual with relatively few distractors. Tasks tend to require the application of two or more steps or processes involving calculation with whole numbers and common decimals, percentages and fractions; simple measurement and spatial representation; estimation; and interpretation of relatively simple data and statistics in texts, tables and graphs.</p>"}
