This provides countries with a quick assessment of which aspects of IWRM are progressing well, and which aspects require increased efforts to reach the target. </p>\n<p>The nature of the target, indicator and survey does not lend itself to disaggregation by sex, age group, income etc. However, social equality is an integral part of IWRM, and there are questions which directly address issues such as gender, vulnerable groups, geographic coverage and broad stakeholder participation in water resources development and management. These questions provide an indication of the national and sub-national situation regarding social equality.</p>"}
