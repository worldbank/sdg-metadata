	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 6-5-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The survey contains 33 questions divided into the four main sections described above. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each question is given a score between 0 and 100, in increments of 10, guided by threshold descriptions for the following 6 categories:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Very low (0)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Low (20)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Medium-low (40)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Medium-high (60)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High (80)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Very high (100)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that guidance is provided for each threshold for each question, to ensure objective and comparable results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The un-weighted average of the question scores within each of the four sections is calculated to give a score of 0 &amp;#x2013; 100 for each section, rounded to the nearest whole number. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The section scores (rounded to the nearest whole number), are averaged (un-weighted), and rounded to the nearest whole number, to give the indicator score, expressed as a number between 0 and 100.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</data>
