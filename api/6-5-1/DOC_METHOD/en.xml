  &lt;li&gt;National focal points selected by each country. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;National focal points are responsible for coordinating a national process to engage governmental and non-governmental stakeholders, as appropriate in the context of each country, to develop draft responses and finalise responses. This may be via email, workshops, and online notices. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The following materials are available for national focal points in 7 languages (English, Spanish, French, Arabic, Russian, Chinese, Portuguese), at &lt;a href=&quot;http://iwrmdataportal.unepdhi.org&quot;&gt;http://iwrmdataportal.unepdhi.org&lt;/a&gt;: the survey (MS Word); a detailed monitoring guide; and a PowerPoint presentation and video recording. In addition, focal points may access the following materials: the 2017 baseline surveys and 2-page results summaries (for 172 countries); and 2017 workshop reports (for 36 countries). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In addition, an &amp;#x201C;SDG 6.5.1 Facilitator&amp;#x2019;s Training Course&amp;#x201D; is available online via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gwp.org/en/sdg6support/consultations/stage-1-activities/training-of-facilitators/&quot;&gt;www.gwp.org/en/sdg6support/consultations/stage-1-activities/training-of-facilitators/&lt;/a&gt; , through the SDG 6 IWRM Support Programme. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A more comprehensive &amp;#x201C;IWRM Stage 1 Support Package&amp;#x201D; is available for a limited number of countries (approximately 60 countries in 2020). The Support Package includes seed funding to engage a Facilitator to support the stakeholder consultation process. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extensive explanations are provided in the monitoring guide and in the survey itself. The survey contains: an overall introduction and explanation; a glossary; an introduction and glossary in each of the four sections; threshold descriptions for six thresholds for each question; and a number of footnotes to explain aspects of questions or threshold descriptions. All materials can be downloaded from &lt;a href=&quot;http://iwrmdataportal.unepdhi.org&quot;&gt;http://iwrmdataportal.unepdhi.org&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, a dedicated Help Desk is available to provide assistance at all times. The Help Desk is accessible via email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:iwrmsdg651@un.org&quot;&gt;iwrmsdg651@un.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
