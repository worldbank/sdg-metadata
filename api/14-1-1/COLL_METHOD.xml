			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;National data are collected through the Regional Seas Programmes to reduce the reporting burden on countries. For countries that are not included in a Regional Seas Programme, UNEP contacts countries directly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For globally derived data, UNEP has established a partnership with NOAA and GEO Blue Planet, the Global Nutrient Management System (GNMS) and the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Ad hoc and Open Ended Expert Group on Marine Litter. This facilitates the production of global data products.&lt;/p&gt;
