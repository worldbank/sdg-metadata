These Multilateral Environmental Agreements are governed by their own meetings of the Contracting Parties. The individual Regional Seas Conventions and Action Plans have both a normative and implementation mandate. They provide an expression of common regional priorities, including those in the delivery of global mandates such as the 2030 Agenda, provisions of Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) and United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) resolutions. They also provide platforms for acting, including through integrated assessment, policy development, capacity building and exchange, as well as through implementation of projects. By building on the mandates of Regional Seas in addressing adverse impacts to the marine and coastal environment, UNEP can enhance impact and sustainability of efforts by utilization of advantages of the Regional Seas under the programme of work at the regional level. </p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
