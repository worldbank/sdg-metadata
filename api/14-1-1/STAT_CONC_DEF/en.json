Coastal eutrophication can lead to serious damage to marine ecosystems, vital sea habitats, and can cause the spread of harmful algal blooms. SDG Indicator 14.1.1a aims to measure the contribution to coastal eutrophication from countries and the state of coastal eutrophication.</p>\n<p>Eutrophication is an excess nutrient loading into coastal environments from anthropogenic sources, resulting in excessive growth of plants, algae and phytoplankton. The basis for these loads is collected from land-based assessments of land use including fertilizer use, population density, socioeconomic factors and other contributors to nutrient pollution runoff. Given the land-based nature of the indicator, it provides a modelled number indicating the risk of coastal eutrophication at a specific river mouth.</p>\n<p>One more important characteristic is Chlorophyll-a deviation. Chlorophyll-a concentrations for this indicator are obtained from the global ocean, 4 km spatial resolution per pixel monthly mean product of the OC-CCI project product for each pixel within the country&#x2019;s territorial sea and exclusive economic zone.</p>\n<p>Territorial sea is a belt of coastal waters extending at most 12 nautical miles from the baseline of a coastal state, as outlined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.</p>\n<p>The Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea. The EEZ shall not extend beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured, as outlined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.</p>\n<p>Based on the existing internationally agreed <a href=\"https://wedocs.unep.org/handle/20.500.11822/30009\">Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP) guidelines</a> and the existing national data collections, it is recommended that the SDG reporting includes sub-indicators related to beach litter, floating plastic and plastic in the sea column, plastic on the sea floor and additional option indicators.</p>\n<p>Plastic litter is most obvious on shorelines, where litter accumulates due to current, wave and wind action, river outflows and by direct littering at the coast. However, plastic litter occurs on the ocean surface, suspended in the water column, on the seabed and in association with biota, due to entanglement or ingestion (GESAMP, 2019).</p>\n<p>Marine litter - any persistent, manufactured or processed solid material which is lost or discarded and ends up in the marine and coastal environment.</p>\n<p>The full methodology for this indicator is available in the document entitled &#x201C;<a href=\"https://wedocs.unep.org/handle/20.500.11822/35086\">Understanding the State of the Ocean: A Global Manual on Measuring SDG 14.1.1, SDG 14.2.1 and SDG 14.5.1</a>&#x201D; (UNEP, 2021). </p>"}
