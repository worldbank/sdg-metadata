	<message>The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 14-1-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The data validation for this indicator will differ according to the level classification of the indicator measured:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Level 1 data: All globally estimated or modelled data will be shared with national statistical offices and other relevant authorities for in-country validation and replacement with national data if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Level 2 data: The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Regional Seas will be carried out extensive data validation procedures that include built-in automated procedures, manual checks and cross-references to national sources of data. Communication will be carried out with countries for clarification and validation of data. Only data that are considered accurate or those confirmed by countries during the validation process will be reported by UNEP on the Global SDG Database. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
