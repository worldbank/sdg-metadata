	<message>The DATA_VALIDATION field for indicator 14-1-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The data validation for this indicator will differ according to the level classification of the indicator measured:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 1: All globally available data (estimated or modelled) will be shared with national statistical offices and other relevant authorities for in-country validation and to replace with national data if available and if not to provide UNEP the no objection to publish the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 2: The data for all sub indicators will be national data reported to UNEP through the Regional Seas. The first data validation will be done by the Regional Seas and later by UNEP before reporting it to UNSD SDG Global Database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 3: the data is a list of supplementary information which is suggested that countries consider monitoring and does not require any reporting and validation.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
