	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources of discrepancies: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of experiences in terms of collecting data on marine plastics and some do not follow a consistent methodology. Similarly, the underlying national nutrient data which feeds into national or global ICEP modelling may include discrepancies (for example, in some cases different national ministries maintain data on fertilizer, wastewater, etc.). It is recommended that national statistical systems review and work to eliminate discrepancies in the underlying data for these indictors.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
