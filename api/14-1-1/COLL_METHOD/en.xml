	<data>&lt;p&gt;The custodian agencies propose to collect national data through the Regional Seas Programmes in order to reduce the reporting burden on countries. For countries that are not included in a Regional Seas Programme then UNEP will reach out directly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For globally derived data, UNEP has established a partnership with NOAA and GEOBluePlanet, with the Global Nutrient Management System (GNMS) and with the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Ad hoc and Open Ended Expert Group on Marine Litter. This will facilitate the production of global data products.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
