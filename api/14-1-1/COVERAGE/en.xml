&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reporting on this indicator is described in the table for each sub-indicator. Reporting will initiate in 2020 for the global indicator on chl-a and plastic modelling. For the other globally derived indicators, reporting will initiate in 2021. National data collection through the Regional Seas already exists for many Regional Seas, this data will compiled for SDG reporting in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2022; A geospatial disaggregation of the state of pollution is proposed. For the ICEP loading indicators, this disaggregation should be at the sub-basin level.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
