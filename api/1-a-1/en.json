Within ODA, basic social services and development food aid focus on poverty alleviation in developing countries.</p><h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n<p>Data in the Creditor Reporting System (i.e. at an activity level), are available from 1973 onwards. However, the data coverage is considered complete since 1995 for commitments and 2002 for disbursements.</p><h1>Methodology</h1>\n<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n<p><strong>From a donor country&#x2019;s perspective</strong>: The sum of bilateral ODA grants by donor that focus on poverty reduction as a share of the donor country&#x2019;s gross national income. </p>\n<p><strong>From a recipient country&#x2019;s perspective</strong>: The sum of total ODA grants from all donors (i.e. DAC donors, multilateral organisations and other bilateral providers of development cooperation) that focus on poverty reduction as a share of the developing country&#x2019;s gross national income. </p><h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Due to high quality of reporting, no estimates are produced for missing data.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>At regional and global levels:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Due to high quality of reporting, no estimates are produced for missing data.</p><h2>Regional aggregates:</h2>\n<p>Global, regional and country figures are based on the sum of ODA grant flows for poverty reduction.</p><h2>Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level:</h2>\n<p>The DAC statistical Reporting Directives govern the reporting of DAC statistics, and are reviewed and agreed by the DAC Working Party of Development Finance Statistics, see: <a href=\"https://one.oecd.org/document/DCD/DAC/STAT(2018)9/FINAL/en/pdf\">https://one.oecd.org/document/DCD/DAC/STAT(2018)9/FINAL/en/pdf</a></p><h2>Quality assurance:</h2>\n<p>The OECD/DAC Secretariat is responsible for verifying and validating data submissions from providers of development cooperation, as well as publishing the data.</p><h1>Data availability</h1>\n<h2>Description:</h2>\n<p>Data are published on an annual basis in December for flows in the previous year.</p>\n<p>Detailed 2019 flows will be published in December 2020.</p>\n<p>Provisional data classification: Tier I</p>\n<h2>Time series:</h2>\n<p>The OECD/DAC has been collecting data on official and private resource flows, from 1960 at an aggregate level, and 1973 at an activity level through the Creditor Reporting System (CRS data are considered complete from 1995 for commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements). </p>\n<h2>Disaggregation:</h2>\n<p>This indicator can be disaggregated by donor, by recipient country, by type of finance, by type of aid, by sub-sector, by policy marker (e.g. gender), etc.</p><h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>\n<p>DAC statistics are standardized on a calendar year basis for all donors and may differ from fiscal year data available in budget documents for some countries.</p><h1>References</h1>\n<h2>URL: </h2>\n<p>See all links here: <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm\">http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm</a></p>\n<h2>References: </h2>\n<p>See all links here: <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm\">http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm</a></p>"}
