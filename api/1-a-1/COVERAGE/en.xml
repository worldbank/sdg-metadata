	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data are published on an annual basis in December for flows in the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed 2019 flows will be published in December 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provisional data classification: Tier I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OECD/DAC has been collecting data on official and private resource flows, from 1960 at an aggregate level, and 1973 at an activity level through the Creditor Reporting System (CRS data are considered complete from 1995 for commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator can be disaggregated by donor, by recipient country, by type of finance, by type of aid, by sub-sector, by policy marker (e.g. gender), etc.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
