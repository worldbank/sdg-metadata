The Institute produces internationally comparable data and methodologies in the fields of education, science, culture and communication for countries at all stages of development.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.moe.gov.bn/DocumentDownloads/Education%202030/Education2030.pdf\"><u>Education 2030 Framework for Action 100</u></a> has clearly states that: &#x201C;<em>In recognition of the importance of harmonization of monitoring and reporting, the UIS will remain the official source of cross-nationally comparable data on education. It will continue to produce international monitoring indicators based on its annual education survey and on other data sources that guarantee international comparability for more than 200 countries and territories. In addition to collecting data, the UIS will work with partners to develop new indicators, statistical approaches and monitoring tools to better assess progress across the targets related to UNESCO&#x2019;s mandate, working in coordination with the SDG-Education 2030 SC&#x201D;</em></p><p>The indicator is used to assess a government&apos;s emphasis on education relative to its investments in other sectors. The indicator shows how much of a priority education is for a given government, over time or in comparison with other countries.</p><p>A high proportion of government expenditure on education demonstrates a high government priority for education relative to other public investments. When interpreting this indicator one should keep in mind that some governments have more (or fewer) financial resources and therefore larger (or smaller) overall budgets, and that countries with younger populations may spend more on education relative to other sectors such as health or social security, and vice-versa. The Education 2030 Framework for Action has endorsed a benchmark for this indicator, which encourages countries to allocate at least 15% to 20% of their public expenditure to education.</p>\n<p>In some instances data on total public expenditure on education refer only to the Ministry of Education, excluding other ministries may also spend a part of their budget on educational activities. Although the IMF aims to publish data on total general government expenditure following common definitions based on the Government Finance Statistics Manual, in practice this concept (and what it includes) may differ between countries.</p><p>Total government expenditure for a given level of education (e.g. primary, secondary, or all levels combined) is expressed as a percentage of total general government expenditure (all sectors).</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msub>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>P</mi>\n        <mi>X</mi>\n        <mi>E</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mo>,</mo>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msub>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <msub>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>X</mi>\n            <mi>E</mi>\n          </mrow>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>n</mi>\n            <mo>,</mo>\n            <mi>t</mi>\n          </mrow>\n        </msub>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <msub>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>T</mi>\n            <mi>P</mi>\n            <mi>X</mi>\n          </mrow>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>t</mi>\n          </mrow>\n        </msub>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n  </math></p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msub>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>P</mi>\n        <mi>X</mi>\n        <mi>E</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mo>,</mo>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msub>\n  </math> = expenditure on education level <em>n</em> as a percentage of total government expenditure in financial year <em>t</em></p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msub>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>X</mi>\n        <mi>E</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mo>,</mo>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msub>\n  </math> = total general government expenditure on education level <em>n</em> in financial year <em>t</em></p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msub>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>T</mi>\n        <mi>P</mi>\n        <mi>X</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msub>\n  </math> = total government expenditure in financial year <em>t</em></p><p>&#x2022; <strong>At country level</strong></p>\n<p>None by data compiler.</p>\n<p>&#x2022; <strong>At regional and global levels</strong></p>\n<p>None by data compiler.</p><p>Regional and global aggregates are not currently available for this indicator.</p><p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>\n<p>156 countries with at least one data point for the period 2010-2019.</p>\n<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>\n<p>1980-2019 in UIS database; 2000-2019 in the SDG Global database.</p>\n<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>\n<p>By level of education.</p><p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>\n<p>None.</p><p><strong>URL:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://uis.unesco.org\">http://uis.unesco.org</a></p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<p>UIS Instructional Manual: Survey of Formal Education </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/instruction-manual-survey-formal-education-2017-en.pdf\">http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/instruction-manual-survey-formal-education-2017-en.pdf</a></p>\n<p>UOE data collection on formal education: Manual on concepts, definitions and classifications</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://uis.unesco.org/en/files/uoe-data-collection-manual-2020-en-pdf\">http://uis.unesco.org/en/files/uoe-data-collection-manual-2020-en-pdf</a></p>\n<p>UIS Questionnaire on Educational Expenditure (ISCED 0-8)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://uis.unesco.org/en/uis-questionnaires\">http://uis.unesco.org/en/uis-questionnaires</a></p>\n<p>IMF World Economic Outlook</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO\">https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO</a></p>","es":"","fr":"<p>Éliminer la pauvreté sous toutes ses formes et partout dans le monde</p>","pt":"","ru":""}}
