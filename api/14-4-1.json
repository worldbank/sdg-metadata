A fish stock whose abundance is at or greater than the level, that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as biologically sustainable. In contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY level, the stock is considered biologically unsustainable.</p>\n<p>MSY is defined as the greatest amount of catch that can be harvested continuously from a stock under constant and current environmental conditions (e.g., habitat, water conditions, species composition and interactions, and anything that could affect birth, growth, or death rates of the stock) without affecting the long-term productivity of the stock. The indicator measures the sustainability of fish resources based a good balance between human use and ecological conservation.</p>\n<p>MSY-based reference points are the most common type of reference points used in fisheries management today. This is primarily because, for decades, reference points from surplus production models have most often been set based on the concept of MSY and they are the basic benchmarks for the sustainability of fisheries set by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, Article 61(3)).</p>\n<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n<p><strong><em>Fish stock</em> </strong>refers to a group of individuals of a single species or sometimes combined species living in a defined area from which catches are taken in a fishery.</p>\n<p>A <strong><em>reference list of stocks</em></strong> should be established by each country and consists of a list of stocks selected according to FAO guidelines, against which the indicator will be reported (Appendix 1). The reference list should include national and shared stocks but not straddling stocks as defined below.</p>\n<p><strong><em>National stocks</em></strong> are located completely within an EEZ and/or territorial waters. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Shared stocks</em></strong><em> </em>are distributed within the EEZ and/or territorial waters of two or more adjacent countries. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Straddling stocks</em></strong> are found to move across boundaries between EEZ waters or between EEZ and high seas (e.g. tuna stocks), and that are caught by multiple countries. </p>\n<p>Countries are asked to report on stocks listed in its reference list, including those monitored through <strong><em>official stock assessments</em></strong> by an authoritative agency, through a scientific process and using best available science and data. These assessments could be based on classic or data-limited methods. </p>\n<p>Stock assessment uses biological information, fishery data such as catch statistics and fishing effort, and scientific survey data to estimate population dynamics of fish stocks for management purposes. Stock assessment methods include biological dynamic models, age-structured models, length-based methods and stock recruitment models.</p><h1>Data sources</h1>\n<h2>Description:</h2>\n<p>The MSY-based reference point is often established through a formal stock assessment process. The data to inform stock assessments can come from many different sources, including fishery-dependent and fishery-independent sources. Fishery-dependent data are collected from the fishery itself, using both commercial and recreational sources through reporting or sample-based surveys at sea, at landing sites, or within fishing communities. Data from these sources are generally compiled into fisheries statistics. They can include information on removals of fish from the sea, which can include landings and discards, and information on the fleet such as number of boats, number of tows, time spent on the sea.</p>\n<p>Fisheries-independent are obtained in ways not related to any fishing activity and are typically collected by scientists via surveys (often scientific cruises) designed to sample species abundance and biomass over long time series, and over consistent seasons and geographic areas. Typically, fisheries-independent data collect biological information on the species (age, length, weight, maturity, etc.), and habitat and environmental information (temperature, salinity, depth, etc.).</p>\n<p>Three primary categories of data inputs are required for stock assessment, including data on life history traits, and time series of catch and fishing effort. <strong><em>Stock abundance</em></strong> is often not known and relative abundance or indices are often used to reflect historical changes in population size. These data can be sourced from fishery-independent surveys, e.g. acoustic or trawl-based sampling, or from fishery-dependent estimates using catch and effort data. Life history parameters provides information on individual growth and stock productivity e.g. fish size, age, reproductive rates, and natural mortality. <strong><em>Catch</em></strong> is the amount of fish removed from a stock by all types of fishing.</p>\n<p><strong>Global/Regional:</strong></p>\n<p>Because of the high data demands of classical stock assessment methods, only a limited number of fish stocks have been assessed. These species account for 17&#x2013;25 percent of the global catch (Branch et al., 2011), and most are caught by fisheries in developed countries. To balance the global representativeness of the assessment results and the goal of using the best available information, the FAO uses a wide spectrum of data and methods to extend its assessment to the fish stocks that account for the majority (70-80 percent) of the global catch (FAO, 2005).</p>\n<p><strong>National:</strong></p>\n<p>For country reporting, a questionnaire was sent out to all FAO member States with marine boundaries in 2019, and will be resent in 2020, 2021, and then on a two-year basis. For the complete list of questions used to inform this indicator, please refer to Appendix 2.</p>\n<h2>Collection process:</h2>\n<p><strong>Global/regional: </strong></p>\n<p>The fish stocks that FAO has monitored since 1974 represent a wide spectrum of data availability, ranging from data-rich and formally assessed stocks to those that have very little information apart from catch statistics by FAO major fishing area and those with no stock assessment at all. For the purposes of using the best available data and information and maintaining consistency among stocks and assessors, a procedure has been defined to identify stock status information (FAO 2011). </p>\n<p><strong>National: </strong></p>\n<p>FAO collects national data through a questionnaire sent to the Principal Focal Point (PFP) of each country. The PFP organises an institutional set-up which identifies the competent authorities to develop a reference list of stocks and completes the questionnaire. The information or data collected through the questionnaire from a country will initially only inform individual country progress. Depending on the evolution and further standardization of country reporting over the next 3-5 years, national data may be used to inform global/regional estimates.</p><h1>Calendar</h1>\n<h2>Data collection:</h2>\n<p>Global/regional: every 2 years (i.e., 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, etc.)</p>\n<p>National: Reporting every 2 years (i.e., 2019, 2021, 2023, 2025, etc.)</p><h2>Data release:</h2>\n<p>National: biennially</p>\n<p>Global/regional: biennially</p><h1>Data providers</h1>\n<p>FAO provides global and regional data. National-level data are generally reported by the National Statistics Office or the Ministry of Fisheries and/or Agriculture.</p><h1>Data compilers</h1>\n<p>FAO</p><h2>Rationale:</h2>\n<p>The United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA [UN, 1995]) and the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (FAO, 1995a) all require maintaining or restoring fish stocks at levels that are capable of producing their maximum sustainable yield (MSY). To fulfil the objectives of these international treaties, fishery management authorities need to undertake assessment of the state of fish stocks and develop effective policies and management strategies. As a UN Agency with a mandate for fisheries, FAO endeavour to provide the international community with the best information on the state of marine fishery resources.</p>\n<p>Since 1974, FAO has been periodically assessing and reporting the state of marine fishery resources using a wide spectrum of methods from numerical models to data poor approaches. FAO global and regional estimates were also used as an MDG indicator for Goal 7 on environment during the period 2000-2015. This facilitated its approval as a Tier I SDG indicator by the 2nd IAEG-SDG in October 2015.</p>\n<p>The indicator has a peculiar nature compared to more conventional SDG indicators. The indicator estimates the sustainability of fish stocks that often move across national boundaries. This led the indicator to be initially reported only at global and regional levels, with regions not corresponding to continental MDG or SDG regions but to marine regions termed &#x201C;FAO Major Fishing Areas&#x201D;.</p>\n<p>Global SDG Indicator Framework is a voluntary mechanism, but countries are required to report if data are available. As a custodian agency, the FAO works to put in action 2030 Agenda&#x2019;s emphasis on country ownership and higher the incentive to take actions at country, regional and global levels. FAO has developed, since 2018, a questionnaire approach to allow individual countries to report on the sustainability of fish stocks. The approach 1) provides a framework for meaningful country-level reporting that complements but does not alter the core methodology of SDG indicator 14.4.1 at the global/regional levels, and 2) provides countries with simplified methods to carry out fish stock assessment in data-limited contexts, to some extent overcoming the technical barriers that traditional methods presented. This is because country-level reporting will be limited to the assessment of stocks that are found only within a country&#x2019;s EEZ, and therefore not include straddling stocks, highly migratory species, or stocks in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ). As a result, national data alone cannot be meaningfully aggregated at global/regional levels, but it can be used to inform country progress on fish stock sustainability within the EEZ. The FAO has developed an online platform to facilitate the estimation and a country&#x2019;s own report of the indicator. The platform provides an E-learning course that help countries to understand the indicator, estimation methodology and report process as well as some simple stock assessment methods that can be used to estimate stock status when only limited data are available to help address the capacity insufficiency faced by many developing countries.</p>\n<p>In 2019, the FAO began sending a questionnaire to countries to collect national data with the aim to help countries in the reporting process. </p><h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n<p>The indicator measures the sustainability of fishery resources, and is an end-result measure of Target 14.4. Its derivation requires the data and technical expertise necessary to perform stock assessment. The indicator at global level is estimated by the FAO based on the methodology developed in the 1980s. Although regular updates were carried out to incorporate technical advances and changes in major fish species, some discrepancies between regions may occur in the representativeness of the reference list in practical fisheries. However, this will not pose a large impact on the reliability of the indicator&#x2019;s temporal trends.</p>\n<p>For the national level, the composition of stocks within the reference list of stocks and the selection criteria used to develop the list will vary between countries, making the indicator suitable for checking countries&#x2019; own progress over time. However, this reduces the comparability of sustainability levels between countries. </p><h1>Methodology</h1>\n<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n<p>FAO currently reports the global and regional indicators calculated from FAO&#x2019;s assessment of a selected list of fish stocks around the world. The methodology is described in the FAO Technical Paper (FAO 2011). </p>\n<p> FAO has been developing the new approach for country-level reporting since 2017, and has consulted with countries in three dedicated expert consultation workshops: In November 2017, FAO convened a workshop to exchange views with national practitioners on the new proposed analytical methods to produce Indicator 14.4.1 at country level<sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-ref-1\">[1]</a></sup>. In February 2019, FAO convened an expert consultation workshop<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[2]</a></sup> on development of the methodologies for the global assessment of fish stock status, with participants from countries and regional fisheries organizations. In October 2019, FAO organized a capacity development workshop on stock status assessment and estimation methods of SDG Indicator 14.4.1 for the Asia Pacific Region, with participants from 17 countries.<strong> </strong>However, so far very few countries have started their own estimation and reporting of Indicator 14.4.1.</p>\n<p><strong>Global/Regional:</strong></p>\n<p>Global and regional estimates of stock sustainability have been performed for 584 fish stocks around the world since 1974, representing 70% of global landings. Each stock is estimated using the methodology described in the FAO Technical Paper (FAO, 2011). </p>\n<p><strong>National:</strong></p>\n<p>The indicator is calculated as the number of stocks with sustainable status divided by the number of stocks with known status in the reference list. This proportion is calculated based on stock numbers, without weighting either by its production volume or stock abundance; that is, every fish stock is considered to have the same importance. </p>\n<p>Countries are requested to report the status of a reference list of fish stocks, which should be determined based on the significance of a specific stock in a society, either in landings, economic contribution to society, or cultural and traditional values, rather than based on whether stock assessment exists.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-1\">1</sup><p> Full report accessible here: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/I8714EN/%20%20\">http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/I8714EN/ </a>  <a href=\"#footnote-ref-1\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">2</sup><p> Full report accessible here<a href=\":%20http:/www.fao.org/3/ca4355en/ca4355en.pdf%20%20\">: http://www.fao.org/3/ca4355en/ca4355en.pdf </a> <a href=\"#footnote-ref-2\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div><p><strong>Treatment of missing values:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This indicator examines marine fish stocks. If a country has no marine capture fisheries then the indicator is not calculated for that country. In such case, no imputation is performed to derive estimates. For countries reporting limited marine fish stock data, additional data are compiled from scientific working groups and are peer reviewed and analyzed based on FAO expert knowledge. However, the estimation of the indicator at regional and global levels was estimated not based on country questionnaires, but by the FAO through a systematic assessment of a reference list selected globally. </p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>At regional and global levels:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>To ensure completeness of regional and global information on stocks, FAO gathers additional information outside of what is provided by each country, in particular concerning the highly migratory and straddling fishing stocks. For shared stocks, FAO may consult with Regional Fisheries Bodies (RFBs), who are mandated to assess and manage stocks with their contracting parties, in order to receive information and data and conduct stock assessment when necessary. </p><h2>Regional aggregates:</h2>\n<p>As explained in the &#x201C;Rationale&#x201D; section,<strong> </strong>national data alone cannot be meaningfully aggregated at global/regional level because country-level reporting will be limited to the assessment of stocks that are found only within a country&#x2019;s EEZ, and therefore not include straddling stocks, highly migratory species, or stocks in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ). Therefore, regional &#x201C;aggregates&#x201D; by FAO Major Fishing Area and the global indicator value are calculated with a specific approach, as described in the FAO Technical Paper (FAO 2011).</p><h2>Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level:</h2>\n<p>In each country, the data available for each stock and expertise level to conduct different types of assessments will differ. Some countries may have classic stock assessments already conducted for many of their stocks, while others may have very few or no assessments available. </p>\n<p>For some countries, little stock assessment has been done. To help these countries and to facilitate their reporting, FAO prepared online materials and tools, including a selection of methods that can be used to evaluate stock status with data limited methods such as length-based and catch-only methods. The strengths and limitations of these methods are discussed in an eLearning course (Lesson 4), and caveats were also provided to avoid misuse and exercise cautions in practice. Furthermore, capacity building workshops have been organised to provide support to countries in stock assessment and reporting on the SDG 14.4.1.</p>\n<p><strong>eLearning course:</strong> <a href=\"https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=502\">https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=502</a></p><h2>Quality assurance:</h2>\n<p>NA</p><h1>Data availability</h1>\n<h2>Description:</h2>\n<p>The indicator has global data from 1974 to 2017.

This list of fish stocks will ideally include existing Assessment units or Management units, and also possibly other unassessed fish stocks that are fished in a given country.

Information should be provided on all of the stocks that contribute to this top 60% (or more) of landings regardless of whether their status is known. Stocks should be input from left to right on the spreadsheet in the order of the largest to smallest total landings for each stock, by Tonnes. Species with multiple different stocks should be input as separate stocks. </li>\n  <li>Contain stocks of major importance in terms of catch, ecosystem role, economic value, and social/cultural considerations. If possible, the list should represent stocks of each of these categories for a given country. For example, care should be taken to include fish stocks that are important to small-scale fisheries as well as large-scale industrial fisheries. Consideration for these different categories will vary between countries.</li>\n  <li>Remain unchanged (i.e. for at least 5 years) to better reflect changes in stock status at the national level and minimize the effect of changing the reference list of stocks (i.e., adding, deleting, merging stocks) into the SDG indicator.

Рыбный запас, численность которого находится на уровне или выше, чем уровень, на котором может осуществляться максимальный устойчивый улов (МУУ), классифицируется как биологически устойчивый. Напротив, когда численность падает ниже уровня МУУ, запас считается биологически неустойчивым. </p>\n<p> МУУ определяется как наибольший объем улова, который можно непрерывно извлекать из запаса при постоянных и текущих экологических условиях (например, среда обитания, водные условия, состав и взаимоотношения видов, а также все, что может повлиять на уровни рождаемости, роста или убыли запаса), не влияя на долгосрочную продуктивность запаса. Показатель отражает устойчивость рыбных ресурсов на основе разумного соотношения между использованием человеком и сохранением окружающей среды. </p>\n<p> Реперные точки, базирующиеся на MУУ, являются наиболее распространенным типом контрольных точек, используемых сегодня в управлении рыболовством. Это происходит прежде всего потому, что на протяжении десятилетий контрольные точки из моделей избыточного производства чаще всего устанавливались на основе концепции MУУ, и они являются основными ориентирами устойчивости рыболовства, установленными Конвенцией ООН по морскому праву (UNCLOS, Статья 61 (3). </p>\n<h2> Понятия: </h2>\n<p> <strong> <em> Рыбные запасы </em> </strong> относятся к группе особей одного вида или иногда комбинированных видов, обитающих в определенном районе, уловы из которого получены в ходе промысла. </p>\n<p> Справочный список запасов должен быть составлен каждой страной и состоять из списка запасов, отобранных в соответствии с руководящими принципами ФАО, по которым будет составляться отчетный показатель (Приложение 1). Справочный список должен включать национальные и совместные запасы, но не трансграничные запасы, как определено ниже. </p>\n<p> <strong> <em> Национальные запасы </em> </strong> находятся полностью в пределах ИЭЗ (исключительной экономической зоны) и / или территориальных вод. </p>\n<p> <strong> <em> Совместные запасы </em> </strong> <em> </em> распределены в пределах ИЭЗ и / или территориальных вод двух или более соседних стран. </p>\n<p> <strong> <em> Трансграничные запасы </em> </strong> перемещаются через границы между водами ИЭЗ или между ИЭЗ и открытым морем (например, запасы тунца), и эти запасы вылавливаются несколькими странами. </p>\n<p>Странам предлагается отчитываться о запасах, перечисленных в их справочном списке, в том числе о тех, которые отслеживаются с помощью <strong> <em> официальных оценок запасов </em> </strong> авторитетным агентством, с помощью научного процесса и с использованием наилучших имеющихся научных методов и данных. Эти оценки могут быть основаны на классическом методе или методе ограниченных данных. </p>\n<p>При оценке запасов используется биологическая информация, данные о промысле, такие как статистика уловов и интенсивность вылова, а также данные научных обследований для оценки динамики популяции рыбных запасов в целях управления. Методы оценки запасов включают биологические динамические модели, модели оценки рыбных запасов на основе возрастной структуры, методы оценка рыбных запасов на основе размерного состава и модели воспроизводства запаса. </p><h1> Источники данных </h1>\n<h2> Описание: </h2>\n<p> Реперная точка на основе МУУ часто устанавливается посредством формального процесса оценки запасов. Данные для формирования оценки запасов могут поступать из множества различных источников, включая зависящие от промысла и независимые от промысла источники. Данные, зависящие от промысла, собираются на самом промысле с использованием как коммерческих, так и рекреационных источников посредством отчетности или выборочных обследований в море, в местах выгрузки или в рыбацких общинах. Данные из этих источников обычно включаются в статистику рыболовства. Они могут включать информацию об извлечении рыбы из моря, которая может включать выгрузки и выбросы рыбы, а также информацию о флоте, такую как количество лодок, количество буксиров, время, проведенное в море. </p>\n<p> Независимые от промысла данные получаются способами, не связанными с какой-либо промысловой деятельностью, и обычно собираются учеными посредством обследований (часто научных рейсов), предназначенных для замера численности видов и биомассы за длительные временные периоды, а также во взаимоувязанные сезоны и географические районы. Обычно независимые от промысла данные включают биологическую информацию о видах (возраст, длина, вес, зрелость и т. д.), а также информацию о среде обитания и экологическую информацию (температура, соленость, глубина и т. д.).</p>\n<p> Для оценки запаса требуются три основные категории первичных данных, включая данные об особенностях жизненного цикла и временные ряды улова, а также интенсивность вылова. <strong> <em> Численность запаса </em> </strong> часто неизвестна, и относительная численность или индексы часто используются для отражения исторических изменений численности популяции. Эти данные могут быть получены из независимых от промысла обследований, например акустический или траловый отбор проб или на основе оценок, независимых от промысла, с использованием данных по уловам и интенсивности вылова. Параметры жизненного цикла предоставляют информацию об индивидуальном росте и продуктивности запасов, например размер рыбы, возраст, уровень репродуктивности и естественной смертности. <strong><em> Улов</em> </strong> - количество рыбы, выловленной из запаса при всех видах ловли. </p>\n<p> <strong> Глобальный / региональный: </strong> </p>\n<p> Из-за высоких требований к данным, применимым для классических методов оценки запасов, было оценено лишь ограниченное количество рыбных запасов. На эти виды приходится 17-25% мирового улова (Branch et al., 2011), и большинство из них вылавливается рыбными хозяйствами в развитых странах. Чтобы сбалансировать глобальную репрезентативность результатов оценки и цель использования наилучшей доступной информации, ФАО использует широкий спектр данных и методов, чтобы распространить свою оценку на те рыбные запасы, которые составляют большую часть (70-80 процентов) всего мирового улова (FAO, 2005). </p>\n<p> <strong> Национальный: </strong> </p>\n<p> Что касается страновой отчетности, то в 2019 году всем государствам-членам ФАО, имеющим морские границы, был разослан вопросник, который будет повторно рассылаться в 2020, 2021 году, а затем каждые два года. Полный список вопросов, используемых для формирования этого показателя, см. в Приложении 2. </p>\n<h2> Процесс сбора: </h2>\n<p> <strong> Глобальный / региональный: </strong> </p>\n<p>Рыбные запасы, за которыми ФАО осуществляет мониторинг с 1974 года, представляют собой широкий спектр данных, начиная от имеющихся в большом количестве данных и официально оцененных запасов до тех, по которым имеется очень мало информации, а только статистика улова по основным промысловым районам ФАО, и до тех, по которым оценка запасов не ведется вообще. В целях использования наилучших имеющихся данных и информации и поддержания согласованности между запасами и специалистами по оценке была определена процедура для определения информации о состоянии запасов (FAO 2011).</p>\n<p> <strong> Национальный: </strong> </p>\n<p> ФАО собирает национальные данные с помощью вопросника, отсылаемого Главному координатору в каждой стране. Главный координатор организует институциональную структуру, в которую входят компетентные органы для разработки справочного списка запасов, и заполняет вопросник. Информация или данные, собранные с помощью вопросника по стране, первоначально будут свидетельствовать только о прогрессе отдельной страны. В зависимости от развития и дальнейшей стандартизации страновой отчетности в течение следующих 3-5 лет национальные данные могут использоваться для получения глобальных / региональных оценок. </p><h1> Календарь </h1>\n<h2> Сбор данных: </h2>\n<p>На глобальном / региональном уровне: каждые 2 года (например, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 и т. д.) </p>\n<p>На страновом уровне: отчетность каждые 2 года (т. е. 2019, 2021, 2023, 2025 и т. д.) </p><h2> Выпуск данных: </h2>\n<p> Национальный уровень: раз в два года </p>\n<p> Глобальный / региональный уровень: раз в два года </p><h1> Поставщики данных </h1>\n<p> ФАО предоставляет глобальные и региональные данные. Данные национального уровня обычно предоставляются Национальным статистическим управлением или Министерством рыболовства и / или сельского хозяйства </p><h1> Составители данных </h1>\n<p> ФАО </p><h2> Обоснование: </h2>\n<p> Конвенция Организации Объединенных Наций (ООН) по морскому праву (UNCLOS), Соглашение Организации Объединенных Наций по рыбным запасам (UNFSA [UN, 1995]) и Кодекс ведения ответственного рыболовства ФАО (FAO, 1995a) - все эти документы требуют поддержания или восстановления рыбных запасов на уровнях, способных обеспечить их максимально устойчивый улов (MУУ). Для достижения целей этих международных договоров рыбохозяйственным органам необходимо провести оценку состояния рыбных запасов и разработать эффективную политику и стратегии управления. Являясь специализированным агентством ООН, уполномоченным заниматься рыболовством, ФАО стремится предоставить международному сообществу самую лучшую информацию о состоянии морских рыбных ресурсов. </p>\n<p> С 1974 года ФАО периодически проводит оценку и сообщает о состоянии морских рыбных ресурсов, используя широкий спектр методов, от числовых моделей до подходов с недостаточным объемом данных. Глобальные и региональные оценки ФАО также использовались в качестве показателя ЦРТ для Цели 7 по окружающей среде в период 2000-2015 годов. Это способствовало его утверждению в качестве показателя ЦУР Уровня I на втором заседании Межучрежденческой координационной группы по окружающей среде-Целям в области устойчивого развития (МКГОС-ЦУР) в октябре 2015 года. </p>\n<p> Показатель имеет своеобразный характер по сравнению с более традиционными показателями ЦУР. Показатель оценивает устойчивость рыбных запасов, которые часто пересекают национальные границы. Это привело к тому, что показатель был первоначально представлен только на глобальном и региональном уровнях, причем регионы соответствовали не континентальным регионам ЦРТ или ЦУР, а морским регионам, обозначенным как «Основные рыболовные районы ФАО».</p>\n<p> Глобальная система показателей ЦУР - это добровольный механизм, но странам необходимо представлять данные, если они имеются в наличии. Как ответственное учреждение, ФАО работает над тем, чтобы в Повестке дня на период до 2030 года сделать упор на восприятие страной программы как своей собственной и повысить стимул к действиям на страновом, региональном и глобальном уровнях. С 2018 года ФАО разработала анкетный подход, позволяющий отдельным странам отчитываться об устойчивости рыбных запасов. Подход 1) обеспечивает основу для информативной отчетности на страновом уровне, которая дополняет, но не изменяет основную методологию показателя 14.4.1 ЦУР на глобальном / региональном уровнях, и 2) предоставляет странам упрощенные методы для проведения оценки рыбных запасов при наличии недостаточных данных, в некоторой степени преодолевая технические барьеры, которые представляли традиционные методы. Это связано с тем, что отчетность на страновом уровне будет ограничиваться оценкой запасов, обнаруженных только в ИЭЗ страны, и, следовательно, не будет включать трансграничные запасы, далеко мигрирующие виды или запасы в районах за пределами национальной юрисдикции (РЗПНЮ). В результате сами по себе национальные данные не могут быть осмысленно агрегированы на глобальном / региональном уровнях, но их можно использовать для информирования о прогрессе страны в обеспечении устойчивости рыбных запасов в ИЭЗ. ФАО разработала онлайн-платформу для облегчения оценки и подготовки собственного отчета страны по показателю. Платформа предоставляет курс электронного обучения, который помогает странам понять суть показателя, методологию оценки и процесс отчетности, а также некоторые простые методы оценки запасов, которые можно использовать для оценки состояния запасов, когда доступны только ограниченные данные, чтобы помочь решить проблему недостаточности производственных мощностей, стоящую перед многими развивающимися странами.</p>\n<p> В 2019 году ФАО начала рассылать странам вопросник для сбора национальных данных с целью помочь странам в процессе отчетности. </p><h2>Комментарии и ограничения:</h2>\n<p>Показатель отражает устойчивость рыбных ресурсов и является критерием оценки конечного результата Задачи 14.4. Его расчет требует данных и технических знаний, необходимых для выполнения оценки запасов. Показатель на глобальном уровне оценивается ФАО на основе методологии, разработанной в 1980-х годах. Хотя регулярно проводились обновления для включения технических достижений и изменений основных видов рыб, но между регионами могут возникать некоторые расхождения в репрезентативности справочного списка в практическом рыболовстве. Однако это не окажет большого влияния на достоверность временных трендов показателя.</p>\n<p>На национальном уровне состав запасов в справочном списке запасов и критерии отбора, используемые для составления списка, будут различаться в зависимости от страны, что делает показатель пригодным для проверки собственного странового прогресса с течением времени. Однако это снижает сопоставимость уровней разумного использования ресурсов между странами. </p><h1>Методология</h1>\n<h2>Метод расчета:</h2>\n<p>В настоящее время ФАО отчитывается о глобальных и региональных показателях, рассчитанных на основе оценки ФАО отобранного списка рыбных запасов по всему миру. Методология описана в Техническом документе ФАО (FAO 2011). </p>\n<p> ФАО разрабатывает новый подход к отчетности на страновом уровне с 2017 года и провела консультации со странами в ходе трех специализированных консультативных семинаров с экспертами: в ноябре 2017 года ФАО провела семинар для обмена мнениями с национальными специалистами-практиками о новых предлагаемых аналитических методах для разработки показателя 14.4.1 на страновом уровне <sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-ref-1\">[1]</a></sup>. В феврале 2019 года ФАО провела консультационный семинар экспертов <sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[2]</a></sup> по разработке методологий для глобальная оценка состояния рыбных запасов с участниками из стран и региональных рыбохозяйственных организаций. В октябре 2019 года ФАО организовала семинар с участниками из 17 стран по наращиванию потенциала для оценки состояния запасов и методам оценки показателя 14.4.1 ЦУР для Азиатско-Тихоокеанского региона. <strong> </strong> Однако до сих пор очень немногие страны начали осуществлять собственную оценку и составление отчетов по показателю 14.4.1.</p>\n<p><strong>На глобальном /региональном уровнях:</strong></p>\n<p>Глобальные и региональные оценки устойчивости запасов были произведены для 584 рыбных запасов по всему миру с 1974 года, что составляет 70% мировых выгруженных уловов. Каждый запас оценивается с использованием методологии, описанной в Техническом документе ФАО (FAO, 2011). </p>\n<p><strong>Ни национальном уровне:</strong></p>\n<p>Показатель рассчитывается как количество запасов с устойчивым статусом, деленное на количество запасов с известным статусом в справочном списке. Эта доля рассчитывается на основе количества запасов, без взвешивания на объем производства или численность запасов; то есть считается, что все рыбные запасы имеют одинаковую значимость.</p>\n<p>Странам предлагается отчитываться о статусе справочного списка рыбных запасов, который должен определяться на основе значимости конкретного запаса в обществе либо с точки зрения вылова, экономического вклада в общество или культурных и традиционных ценностей, а не на основе факта наличия или отсутствия оценки запасов.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-1\">1</sup><p> Полный отчет доступен здесь: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/I8714EN/%20%20\">http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/I8714EN/ </a>  <a href=\"#footnote-ref-1\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">2</sup><p>Полный отчет доступен здесь<a href=\":%20http:/www.fao.org/3/ca4355en/ca4355en.pdf%20%20\">: http://www.fao.org/3/ca4355en/ca4355en.pdf </a><a href=\"#footnote-ref-2\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div><p><strong>Обработка отсутствующих значений:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>На страновом уровне:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Этот показатель свидетельствует о морских рыбных запасах. Если в стране нет морского рыболовства, показатель для этой страны не рассчитывается. В таком случае вменение для получения оценок не выполняется. Для стран, представляющих ограниченные данные о морских рыбных запасах, дополнительные данные собираются научными рабочими группами и подвергаются независимой экспертизе и анализу на основе экспертных знаний ФАО. Однако оценка показателя на региональном и глобальном уровнях была произведена не на основе вопросников по странам, а Продовольственной и сельскохозяйственной организацией ООН посредством систематической оценки справочного списка, отобранного на глобальном уровне. </p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>На региональном и глобальном уровнях:</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Чтобы обеспечить полноту региональной и глобальной информации о запасах, ФАО собирает дополнительную информацию помимо той, что предоставляется каждой страной, в частности, относительно далеко мигрирующих и трансграничных рыбных запасов. В отношении совместных запасов ФАО может консультироваться с региональными рыбохозяйственными органами (РРХО), которые уполномочены оценивать запасы и управлять ими вместе с договаривающимися сторонами, чтобы получать информацию и данные и при необходимости проводить оценку запасов. </p><h2>Региональные агрегаты:</h2>\n<p>Как разъясняется в разделе &#x201C; Обоснование &#x201D; одни только национальные данные не могут быть достоверно агрегированы на глобальном / региональном уровне, поскольку отчетность на уровне страны будет ограничиваться оценкой запасов, обнаруженных только в ИЭЗ страны, и, следовательно, не включает трансграничные запасы, далеко мигрирующие виды или запасы в районах, находящихся за пределами национальной юрисдикции (ABNJ). Следовательно, региональные &#x201C; агрегаты &#x201D; по основным промысловым районам ФАО и значение глобального показателя рассчитываются с использованием специального подхода, как описано в Техническом документе ФАО (FAO 2011).</p><h2>Доступные странам методы и руководства для составления данных на национальном уровне:</h2>\n<p>В каждой стране данные, доступные для каждого запаса и уровня знаний для проведения различных типов оценок, будут разными. Некоторые страны могут уже иметь проведенные классические оценки многих своих запасов, в то время как другие могут иметь очень мало оценок или вообще их не иметь. </p>\n<p>Для некоторых стран было проведено мало оценок запасов. Чтобы помочь этим странам и облегчить процесс составления отчетности, ФАО подготовила онлайн-материалы и инструменты, включая набор методов, которые можно использовать для оценки состояния запаса с помощью методов с ограниченными данными, таких как методы, основанные на длине и только на данных по улову. Сильные и слабые стороны этих методов обсуждаются в курсе электронного обучения (Урок 4), а также были сделаны предостережения, чтобы избежать неправильного использования и соблюдать осторожность на практике. Кроме того, были организованы семинары по наращиванию потенциала для оказания поддержки странам в оценке запасов и составлении отчетности по ЦУР 14.4.1.</p>\n<p><strong>eLearning course:</strong><a href=\"https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=502\">https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=502</a></p><h2> Обеспечение качества: </h2>\n<p> Не применимо </p><h1>Доступность данных</h1>\n<h2>Дезагрегирование:</h2>\n<p>Показатель содержит глобальные данные с 1974 по 2017 год.

Этот список рыбных запасов в идеале должен включать существующие единицы оценки или единицы управления, а также, возможно, другие неоцененные рыбные запасы, которые вылавливаются в данной стране. В список не будут включены запасы трансграничных видов в открытом море, в основном тунец и скумбриевидные тунцы.</p>\n<p>Список должен:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Представлять не менее 60% (по возможности предпочтителен более высокий процент) национального общего выгруженного и / или зарегистрированного вылова (всего в тоннах, исключая выгрузки трансграничных запасов). Информация должна быть предоставлена по всем запасам, которые составляют эти 60% (или более) максимальных выгрузок, независимо от того, известен ли их статус. Запасы следует вводить в таблицу слева направо в порядке от наибольшей до наименьшей общей выгрузки для каждого запаса в тоннах. Виды с несколькими разными рыбными запасами следует вводить как отдельные рыбные запасы. </li>\n  <li>Содержать запасы, имеющие большое значение с точки зрения улова, роли экосистемы, экономической значимости и социальных / культурных соображений. Если возможно, в списке должны быть представлены запасы каждой из этих категорий для данной страны. Например, следует позаботиться о включении рыбных запасов, которые важны для маломасштабного рыболовства, а также для крупномасштабного промышленного рыболовства. Важность этих различных категорий для разных стран будет различаться.</li>\n  <li>Оставаться без изменений (то есть в течение как минимум 5 лет), чтобы лучше отражать изменения в состоянии запасов на национальном уровне и минимизировать влияние изменения справочного списка запасов (т.е. добавление, удаление, объединение запасов) в показателе ЦУР.
