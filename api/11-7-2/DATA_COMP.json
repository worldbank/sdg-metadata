The result would be multiplied by 100.</p>\n<p>This is a survey-based indicator that measures the experience of any of a set of behaviours that are collectively referred to as physical harassment and sexual harassment. Questions on physical and sexual harassment are to be measured separately. The results can then be combined. Both numerator and denominator are measured through sample surveys of the general population.</p>\n<p>The computation of this indicator requires the inclusion of a short module of eight questions in a representative population survey.
