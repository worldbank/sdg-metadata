	<message>The FREQ_COLL field for indicator 11-7-2, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The indicator will be collected annually through the United Nations Crime Trends Survey (UN-CTS), the regular data collection used by UNODC to collect data from UN Member States (based on the network of national UN-CTS Focal Points). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries are encouraged to conduct surveys on harassment through the proposed module in regular intervals, but at least every four years to reflect progress between each of the quadrennial reviews of Goal 11 at the High Level Political Forum (HLPF).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
