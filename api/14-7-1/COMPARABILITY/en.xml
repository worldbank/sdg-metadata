	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 14-7-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Stock status taken from 14.4.1 is estimated by FAO based on the methodologies developed in the 1980s. Although regular updates were carried out to incorporate technical advances and changes in major fish species, some discrepancies between regions may occur in the representativeness of the reference list in practical fisheries. However, this will not pose a large impact on the reliability of the indicator&amp;#x2019;s temporal trends.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
