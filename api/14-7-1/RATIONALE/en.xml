	<message>The RATIONALE field for indicator 14-7-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Although target 14.7 promotes the sustainable use of marine resources &amp;#x201C;including of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism&amp;#x201D;, this indicator as selected by the IAEG-SDG focuses only on the sustainable use of marine resources by fisheries. The methodology hereby proposed by FAO thus measures sustainable fisheries as a percentage of GDP, in accordance with the agreed indicator formulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The share of value added from an industry in GDP is commonly used as an indication of its economic importance. Accordingly, the value added of marine capture fisheries indicates the prominence of marine fish related activities in the country&amp;#x2019;s economy and its importance for livelihoods. Both GDP and the VA are measured in constant prices and domestic currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks that are fished at sustainable levels are able to support the communities and industries which rely on them, without compromising reproduction and long-term sustainability. By contrast, a stock that is exploited to a point where it cannot replenish itself will ultimately provide sub-optimal long-term economic returns for stakeholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The status of a fish stock is evaluated through various processes of assessment that commonly combine biological and statistical information to assess changes in its abundance in response to fishing, which also enables forecasting of future trends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAO has been periodically analysing and compiling the status of marine fish stocks combining the results of formal stock assessments available, including the assessments carried out at the regional level and a finer scale by national institutions and scientific working groups. For stocks that do not have a formal stock assessment, effort is made to collect relevant data and information from the literature, or from local experts, that could be used to infer stock status (for instance trends in catch rates, size frequency distribution of the catch, occasional fishing mortality estimates through surveys, etc.). The information from various sources is analysed and synthesized to classify the exploitation status of fish stocks. FAO monitoring of stocks will be enhanced with the implementation of SDG indicator 14.4.1, which tracks progress towards more fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels at national, regional (across FAO Major Fishing Areas) and global levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on FAO&amp;#x2019;s monitoring of stocks at regional and global level, the percentage of fish resources that are within biologically sustainable levels has exhibited a downward trend from 90 percent in 1974 to 67 percent in 2015, while 33 percent are considered to be overexploited. Overexploitation not only has negative ecological consequences, but also reduces long-term fishery yields, which have adverse social and economic effects, particularly for dependent communities in developing countries and Small Island Developing States (SIDS).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
