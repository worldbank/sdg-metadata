			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;All data used in the calculation of this indicator is already provided by countries or published by FAO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National accounts data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National accounts data is used for both GDP and the value added of fisheries and aquaculture. This data is obtained from UNSD and OECD databases, both available online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock status:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fish stocks that FAO has monitored since 1974 represent a wide spectrum of data availability, ranging from data-rich and formally assessed stocks to those that have very little information apart from catch statistics by FAO major fishing area and those with no stock assessment at all. For the purposes of using the best available data and information and maintaining consistency among stocks and assessors, a procedure has been defined to identify stock status information (FAO 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAO collects national data through a questionnaire sent to the Principal Focal Point (PFP) of each country. The PFP organises an institutional set-up which identifies the competent authorities to develop a reference list of stocks and completes the questionnaire. The information or data collected through the questionnaire from a country will initially only inform individual country progress. FAO is working on a convergence (where possible) of the two processes under SDG indicator 14.4.1, and good-quality stock status assessments reported by countries for the national indicators will be included in the regional/global indicator calculations, depending on the evolution and further standardization of country reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is applicable for countries with marine borders (or those bordering the Caspian Sea) and therefore excludes landlocked countries from data collection and processing.&lt;/p&gt;
