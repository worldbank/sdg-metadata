The establishment of protected areas is an important mechanism for achieving this aim, and this indicator serves as a means of measuring progress toward the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of mountain ecosystems and their services, in line with obligations under international agreements. Importantly, while it can be disaggregated to report on any given single ecosystem of interest, it is not restricted to any single ecosystem type.</p>\n<p>Levels of access to protected areas vary among the protected area management categories. Some areas, such as scientific reserves, are maintained in their natural state and closed to any other use. Others are used for recreation or tourism, or even open for the sustainable extraction of natural resources. In addition to protecting biodiversity, protected areas have high social and economic value: supporting local livelihoods; maintaining fisheries; harbouring an untold wealth of genetic resources; supporting thriving recreation and tourism industries; providing for science, research and education; and forming a basis for cultural and other non-material values.</p>\n<p>This indicator adds meaningful information to, complements and builds from traditionally reported simple statistics of mountain area covered by protected areas, computed by dividing the total protected area within a country by the total territorial area of the country and multiplying by 100 (e.g., Chape et al. </p>\n<p>2005). Such percentage area coverage statistics do not recognise the extreme variation of biodiversity importance over space (Rodrigues et al. 2004), and so risk generating perverse outcomes through the protection of areas which are large at the expense of those which require protection.</p>\n<p>The indicator was used to track progress towards the 2011&#x2013;2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014, CBD 2020a), and was used as an indicator towards the Convention on Biological Diversity&#x2019;s 2010 Target (Butchart et al. 2010). It has been proposed as an indicator for monitoring progress towards the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (CBD 2020b).</p><p>Quality control criteria are applied to ensure consistency and comparability of the data in the World Database on Protected Areas. New data are validated at UNEP-WCMC through a number of tools and translated into the standard data structure of the World Database on Protected Areas. Discrepancies between the data in the World Database on Protected Areas and new data are minimised by provision of a manual (UNEP-WCMC 2019) and resolved in communication with data providers. Similar processes apply for the incorporation of data into the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas (BirdLife International 2019).</p>\n<p>The indicator does not measure the effectiveness of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss, which ultimately depends on a range of management and enforcement factors not covered by the indicator. A number of initiatives are underway to address this limitation. Most notably, numerous mechanisms have been developed for assessment of protected area management, which can be synthesised into an indicator (Leverington et al. 2010). This is used by the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership as a complementary indicator of progress towards Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 </p>\n<p>(http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement). However, there may be little relationship between these measures and protected area outcomes (Nolte &amp; Agrawal 2013). More recently, approaches to &#x201C;green listing&#x201D; have started to be developed, to incorporate both management effectiveness and the outcomes of protected areas, and these are likely to become progressively important as they are tested and applied more broadly.</p>\n<p>Data and knowledge gaps can arise due to difficulties in determining whether a site conforms to the IUCN definition of a protected area or the CBD definition of an Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures. However, given that both are incorporated into the indicator, misclassifications (as one or the other) do not impact the calculated indicator value.</p>\n<p>Regarding important sites, the biggest limitation is that site identification to date has focused mainly on specific subsets of biodiversity, for example birds (for Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas) and highly threatened species (for Alliance for Zero Extinction sites). While Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas have been documented to be good surrogates for biodiversity more generally (Brooks et al. 2001, Pain et al. 2005), the application of the unified standard for identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (IUCN 2016) sites across different levels of biodiversity (genes, species, ecosystems) and different taxonomic groups remains a high priority, building from efforts to date (Eken et al. 2004, Knight et al. 2007, Langhammer et al. 2007, Foster et al. 2012). Birds now comprise less than 50% of the species for which Key Biodiversity Areas have been identified, and as Key Biodiversity Area identification for other taxa and elements of biodiversity proceeds, such bias will become a less important consideration in the future.</p>\n<p>Key Biodiversity Area identification has been validated for a number of countries and regions where comprehensive biodiversity data allow formal calculation of the site importance (or &#x201C;irreplaceability&#x201D;) using systematic conservation planning techniques (Di Marco et al. 2016, Montesino Pouzols et al. 2014).</p>\n<p>Future developments of the indicator will include: a) expansion of the taxonomic coverage of mountain Key Biodiversity Areas through application of the Key Biodiversity Areas standard (IUCN 2016) to a wide variety of mountain vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and ecosystem type; b) improvements in the data on protected areas by continuing to increase the proportion of sites with documented dates of designation and with digitised boundary polygons (rather than coordinates); and c) increased documentation of Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures in the World Database of OECMs.</p><p>This indicator is calculated from data derived from a spatial overlap between digital polygons for protected areas from the World Database on Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC &amp; IUCN 2020), digital polygons for Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures from the World Database on OECMs and digital polygons for mountain Key Biodiversity Areas (from the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, including Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas, Alliance for Zero Extinction sites, and other Key Biodiversity Areas). Sites were classified as mountain Key Biodiversity Areas by undertaking a spatial overlap between the Key Biodiversity Area polygons and a mountain raster layer (UNEP-WCMC 2002), classifying any Key Biodiversity Area as a mountain Key Biodiversity Area where it had &#x2265;5% overlap with the mountain layer. The value of the indicator at a given point in time, based on data on the year of protected area establishment recorded in the World Database on Protected Areas, is computed as the mean percentage of each Key Biodiversity Area currently recognised that is covered by protected areas and/or Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures.</p>\n<p>Protected areas lacking digital boundaries in the World Database of Protected Areas, and those sites with a status of &#x2018;proposed&#x2019; or &#x2018;not reported&#x2019; are omitted. Degazetted sites are not kept in the WDPA and are also not included. Man and Biosphere Reserves are also excluded as these often contain potentially unprotected areas. Year of protected area establishment is unknown for ~12% of protected areas in the World Database on Protected Areas, generating uncertainty around changing protected area coverage over time. To reflect this uncertainty, a year was randomly assigned from another protected area within the same country, and then this procedure repeated 1,000 times, with the median plotted. </p>\n<p>Prior to 2017, the indicator was presented as the percentage of Key Biodiversity Areas completely covered by protected areas. However, it is now presented as the mean % of each Key Biodiversity Area that is covered by protected areas in order to better reflect trends in protected area coverage for countries or regions with few or no Key Biodiversity Areas that are completely covered.</p><p>Protected Areas and OECMs are validated through dialogue with the governing authority, who signs a data contributor agreement that these sites are, to the best of their knowledge, an accurate depiction of the sites in question. Over time the data for sites may improve or other aspects of the sites may change, as and when this occurs a further data sharing agreement is required by the site&#x2019;s governing authority.</p>\n<p>Proposed Key Biodiversity Areas undergo detailed checking by Regional Focal Points, formal Review of KBA Proposals by independent Reviewers, and validation of Nominated Key Biodiversity Areas by the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat. For further information, see the Guidance on Proposing, Reviewing, Nominating and Confirming KBAs available in KBA Secretariat (2019) at <a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/assets/35687f50ac0bcad155ab17447b48885a\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/assets/35687f50ac0bcad155ab17447b48885a</a>.</p>\n<p>When the indicators of protected area coverage of Key Biodiversity Areas are updated each year, the updated indicators (and underlying numbers of protected areas, Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures, and Key Biodiversity Areas) are made available for review by countries prior to submission to the SDG Indicators Database. This is achieved through updating the country profiles in the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (<a href=\"https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles\">https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles</a>) and circulating these for consultation and review to CBD National Focal Points, SDG National Statistical Office Focal Points, and IUCN State Members.</p><p>No adjustments are made to the index with respect to harmonization of breakdowns or for compliance with specific international or national definitions.</p><p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>\n<p>Data are available for protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas in all of the world&#x2019;s countries, and so no imputation or estimation of national level data is necessary.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>\n<p>Global indicators of protected area coverage of important sites for biodiversity are calculated as the mean percentage of each Key Biodiversity Area that is covered by protected areas and Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures. The data are generated from all countries, and so while there is uncertainty around the data, there are no missing values as such and so no need for imputation or estimation.</p><p>Regional indices are calculated as the mean percentage of each Key Biodiversity Area in the region covered by (i.e. overlapping with) protected areas and/or Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures: in other words, the percentage of each Key Biodiversity Area covered by these designations, averaged over all Key Biodiversity Areas in the particular region.</p><p><strong><em>Protected areas</em></strong></p>\n<p>Data on protected areas are submitted by government agencies to the World Database on Protected Areas and disseminated through Protected Planet. The WDPA has its origins in a 1959 UN mandate when the United Nations Economic and Social Council called for a list of national parks and equivalent reserves Resolution 713 (XXVIII). More details are available here: https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas. The UN List of Protected Areas has been published in 1961/62, 1966/71, 1972 (addendum to the 1966/71 edition), 1973, 1974, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1985, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2003, 2014 and 2018 which have resulted in a global network of national data providers for the WDPA. For example, in 2014 all Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) National Focal points and all National Focal points for the CBD Protected Areas Programme of Work (PoWPA) to request data for the 2014 Un List of Protected Areas (<a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas-2014\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas-2014</a>). Protected areas data are therefore compiled directly from government agencies, regional hubs and other authoritative sources in the absence of a government source. All records have a unique metadata identifier (MetadataID) which links the spatial database to the Source table where all sources are described. The data is collated and standardised following the WDPA Data Standards and validated with the source. The process of collation, validation and publication of data as well as protocols and the WDPA data standards are regularly updated in the WDPA User Manual (<a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual</a>) made available through www.protectedplanet.net where all spatial data and the Source table are also published every month and can be downloaded. The WDPA User Manual (published in English, Spanish, and French) provides guidance to countries on how to submit protected areas data to the WDPA, the benefits of providing such data, and the data standards and quality checks that are performed. </p>\n<p><em>Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures</em></p>\n<p>Guiding principles, common characteristics and criteria for identification of OECMs are available in CBD (2018) at <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/doc/decisions/cop-14/cop-14-dec-08-en.pdf\">https://www.cbd.int/doc/decisions/cop-14/cop-14-dec-08-en.pdf</a>.</p>\n<p>Guidance on recognising and reporting other effective area-based conservation measures is available in IUCN-WCPA Task Force on OECMs (2019) at: <a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/48773\">https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/48773</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Key Biodiversity Areas</em></p>\n<p>The &#x201C;Global Standard for the Identification of Key Biodiversity Areas&#x201D; (<a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259\">https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259</a>) comprises the standard recommendations available to countries in the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas.

Anyone with appropriate data may propose a site as a KBA, although consultation with relevant stakeholders at the local and national level is required when identifying the site and needs to be documented in the proposal. In order to propose a site as a KBA, a proposer must apply the KBA criteria to data on biodiversity elements (species and ecosystems) at the site. Associated with the proposal process is the need to delineate the site accurately so that its boundaries are clear. Although anyone with appropriate scientific data may propose a site to qualify as a Key Biodiversity Area, wide consultation with stakeholders at the national level (both non-governmental and governmental organizations) is required during the proposal process. The formal proposal is then made using a proposal process that ensures there is an independent review of the proposal before a site is incorporated in the World Database of KBAs. This is important given that KBA status of a site may lead to changes in actions of governments, private sector companies and other institutions following consultation as appropriate. </p>\n<p>Key Biodiversity Area identification builds off the existing network of Key Biodiversity Areas, including those identified as (a) Important Bird &amp; Biodiversity Areas through the BirdLife Partnership of 120 national organisations (<a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife-partners\">http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife-partners</a>), (b) Alliance for Zero Extinction sites by 93 national and international organisations in the Alliance (<a href=\"http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html\">http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html</a>), and (c) other Key Biodiversity Areas by civil society organisations supported by the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund in developing ecosystem profiles, named in each of the profiles listed here (<a href=\"http://www.cepf.net/resources/publications/Pages/ecosystem_profiles.aspx\">http://www.cepf.net/resources/publications/Pages/ecosystem_profiles.aspx</a>), with new data strengthening and expanding expand the network of these sites.</p>\n<p>The main steps of the Key Biodiversity Area identification process are the following: </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>submission of Expressions of Intent to identify a Key Biodiversity Area to Regional Focal Points; </li>\n  <li>Proposal Development process, in which proposers compile relevant data and documentation and consult national experts, including organizations that have already identified Key Biodiversity Areas in the country, either through national Key Biodiversity Area Coordination Groups or independently;</li>\n  <li>review of proposed Key Biodiversity Areas by Independent Expert Reviewers, verifying the accuracy of information within their area of expertise; and</li>\n  <li>a Site Nomination phase comprising the submission of all the relevant documentation for verification by the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat. Sites confirmed by the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat to qualify as Key Biodiversity Areas are then published on the Key Biodiversity Areas website (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home</a>).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once a Key Biodiversity Area is identified, monitoring of its qualifying features and its conservation status is important. Proposers, reviewers and those undertaking monitoring can join the Key Biodiversity Areas Community to exchange their experiences, case studies and best practice examples.</p>\n<p>The R code for calculating protected area coverage of Key Biodiversity Areas is documented in Simkins et al. (2020). </p><p>For protected areas and OECMs please see the section on validation. Ensuring the WDPA and WDOECM remain an accurate and true depiction of reality is a never-ending task; however, over time the quality of the data (e.g. the proportion of sites with defined boundaries) is increasing.</p>\n<p>For Key Biodiversity Areas, see above and below, plus the guidance on Proposing, Reviewing, Nominating and Confirming KBAs which is available in KBA Secretariat (2019) at <a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/assets/35687f50ac0bcad155ab17447b48885a\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/assets/35687f50ac0bcad155ab17447b48885a</a>. Data quality is ensured through wide stakeholder engagement in the KBA proposal process, data checking by Regional Focal Points, formal Review of KBA Proposals by independent Reviewers, and validation of Nominations by the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat. Furthermore, an independent KBA Standards and Appeals Committee ensures the correct application of the Global Standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas, and oversees a formal Procedure for handling of appeals against the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (see http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/assets/1b388c918e14c5f4c3d7a0237eb0d366).</p><p>Information on the process of how protected area data are collected, standardised and published is available in the WDPA User Manual at: <a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual</a> which is available in English, French and Spanish.

Data quality is ensured through wide stakeholder engagement in the KBA proposal process, data checking by Regional Focal Points, formal Review of KBA Proposals by independent Reviewers, and validation of Nominations by the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat. </p>\n<p>In addition, the Chairs of the IUCN Species Survival Commission and World Commission on Protected Areas (both of whom are elected by the IUCN Membership of governments and non-governmental organisations), appoint the Chair of an independent Key Biodiversity Areas Standards and Appeals Committee, which ensures the correct application of the Global Standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas, and oversees a formal Procedure for handling of appeals against the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (see http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/assets/1b388c918e14c5f4c3d7a0237eb0d366).</p>\n<p>Before submission to the UN SDG Indicators database the annually updated indicators of coverage of Key Biodiversity Areas by protected areas and Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures are incorporated into updated Country Profiles on the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (<a href=\"https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles\">https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles</a>) and then sent for consultation to National Focal Points of the Convention on Biological Diversity (<a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml\">https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml</a>), National Statistics Offices SDG Representatives and UN Permanent Missions (Geneva) representatives. </p><p>High.</p><p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>\n<p>This indicator has been classified by the IAEG-SDGs as Tier 1. Current data are available for all countries in the world, and these are updated on an ongoing basis. Index values for each country are available in the UN SDG Indicators Database <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/\">https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/</a>. Graphs of Protected area coverage of Key Biodiversity Areas are also available for each country in the BIP Indicators Dashboard (<a href=\"https://bipdashboard.natureserve.org/bip/SelectCountry.html\">https://bipdashboard.natureserve.org/bip/SelectCountry.html</a>), and the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool Country Profiles (<a href=\"https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles\">https://ibat-alliance.org/country_profiles</a>).</p>\n<p>Underlying data on protected areas and Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures are available at <a href=\"http://www.protectedplanet.net\">www.protectedplanet.net</a>. Data on Key Biodiversity Areas are available at <a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org\">www.keybiodiversityareas.org</a>. Data on subsets of KBAs are available for Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas at <a href=\"http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/search\">http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/search</a> and for Alliance for Zero Extinction sites at https://zeroextinction.org.</p>\n<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>\n<p>Given that data for the global indicator are compiled at national levels, it is straightforward to disaggregate to national and regional levels (e.g., Han et al. 2014), or conversely to aggregate to the global level. Key Biodiversity Areas span all ecosystem types through the marine environment (Edgar et al. 2008) and beyond. The indicator can therefore be reported in combination across marine systems along with terrestrial or freshwater systems, or disaggregated among them. However, individual Key Biodiversity Areas can encompass marine, terrestrial, and freshwater systems simultaneously, and so determining the results is not simply additive. </p><p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>\n<p>National processes provide the data that are incorporated into the World Database on Protected Areas, the World Database on Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures, and the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, so there are very few discrepancies between national indicators and the global one. One minor source of difference is that the World Database on Protected Areas incorporates internationally-designated protected areas (e.g., UNESCO World Heritage sites, Ramsar sites, etc), a few of which are not considered by their sovereign nations to be protected areas. </p>\n<p>Note that because countries do not submit comprehensive data on degazetted protected areas to the WDPA, earlier values of the indictor may marginally underestimate coverage. Furthermore, there is also a lag between the point at which a protected area is designated on the ground and the point at which it is reported to the WDPA. As such, current or recent coverage may also be underestimated.</p><p><strong>URL:</strong></p>\n<p>http://www.unep-wcmc.org/; http://www.birdlife.org/; http://www.iucn.org/</p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<p>These metadata are based on http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mi/wiki/7-6-Proportion-</p>\n<p>of-terrestrial-and-marine-areas-protected.ashx, supplemented by http://www.bipindicators.net/paoverlays and the references listed below.</p>\n<p>BIRDLIFE INTERNATIONAL (2014).

El establecimiento de áreas protegidas es un mecanismo importante para lograr este objetivo, y este indicador sirve como medio para medir el progreso hacia la conservación, la restauración y el uso sostenible de los ecosistemas de montaña y sus servicios, en línea con las obligaciones de los acuerdos internacionales. Es importante destacar que, aunque puede desglosarse para informar sobre cualquier ecosistema de interés, no se limita a ningún tipo de ecosistema, por lo que refleja fielmente la intención de la meta 15.1 de los ODS.</p>\n<p>Los niveles de acceso a las áreas protegidas varían entre las categorías de gestión de áreas protegidas. Algunas áreas, como las reservas científicas, se mantienen en su estado natural y están cerradas a cualquier otro uso. Otras se utilizan para el ocio o el turismo, o incluso están abiertas para la extracción sostenible de recursos naturales. Además de proteger la biodiversidad, las áreas protegidas tienen un alto valor social y económico: apoyan los medios de vida locales; protegen las cuencas hidrográficas de la erosión; albergan una riqueza incalculable de recursos genéticos; apoyan industrias prósperas de ocio y turismo; proporcionan ciencia, investigación y educación; y forman una base para los valores culturales y otros valores no materiales.</p>\n<p>Este indicador añade información significativa, complementa y se basa en las estadísticas simples tradicionalmente comunicadas sobre la superficie de montaña cubierta por áreas protegidas, que se calculan dividiendo la superficie total protegida dentro de un país por la superficie territorial total del país y multiplicando por 100 (por ejemplo, Chape et al. 2005). Estas estadísticas de porcentaje de cobertura de superficie no reconocen la extrema variación de la importancia de la biodiversidad en el espacio (Rodrigues et al. 2004), por lo que se corre el riesgo de generar resultados perversos a través de la protección de áreas que son grandes a expensas de las que requieren protección.</p>\n<p>El indicador se utiliza para seguir el progreso hacia el Plan Estratégico para la Diversidad Biológica 2011&#x2013;2020 (CDB 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014), y se utilizó como indicador hacia el Objetivo 2010 del Convenio sobre la Diversidad Biológica (Butchart et al. 2010).</p><h2>Comentarios y limitaciones:</h2>\n<p>Se aplican criterios de control de calidad para garantizar la coherencia y la comparabilidad de los datos de la Base de Datos Mundial sobre Áreas Protegidas. Los nuevos datos se validan en el PNUMA-WCMC mediante una serie de herramientas y se traducen a la estructura de datos estándar de la Base de Datos Mundial sobre Áreas Protegidas. Las discrepancias entre los datos de la Base de Datos Mundial sobre Áreas Protegidas y los nuevos datos se minimizan mediante un manual (PNUMA-WCMC 2019) y se resuelven en comunicación con los proveedores de datos. Se aplican procesos similares para la incorporación de datos en la <em>Base de datos mundial de áreas clave para la biodiversidad</em> (BirdLife International 2019).</p>\n<p>El indicador no mide la eficacia de las áreas protegidas en la reducción de la pérdida de biodiversidad, que en última instancia depende de una serie de factores de gestión y aplicación que no están cubiertos por el indicador. Se están llevando a cabo varias iniciativas para abordar esta limitación. En particular, se han desarrollado numerosos mecanismos para evaluar la gestión de las áreas protegidas, que pueden sintetizarse en un indicador (Leverington et al. 2010). La Asociación de Indicadores de Biodiversidad lo utiliza como indicador complementario del progreso hacia la Meta 11 de Aichi para la Biodiversidad (<a href=\"http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement\">http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement</a>). Sin embargo, puede haber poca relación entre estas medidas y los resultados de las áreas protegidas (Nolte y Agrawal 2013). Más recientemente, se han empezado a desarrollar enfoques de &#x201C;listas verdes&#x201D; para incorporar tanto la eficacia de la gestión como los resultados de las áreas protegidas, y es probable que adquieran una importancia progresiva a medida que se prueben y se apliquen más ampliamente.</p>\n<p>Pueden surgir brechas de datos y conocimientos debido a las dificultades para determinar si un lugar se ajusta a la definición de área protegida de la UICN, y a algunas áreas protegidas no se les asignan categorías de gestión. Además, &#x201C;otras medidas efectivas de conservación basadas en áreas&#x201D;, como se especifica en la Meta de Aichi para la Biodiversidad </p>\n<p>11 del Plan Estratégico para la Diversidad Biológica 2011&#x2013;2020, reconocen que algunos lugares más allá de la red formal de áreas protegidas, si bien no se gestionan principalmente para la conservación de la naturaleza, pueden ser gestionados de forma coherente con la persistencia de la biodiversidad para la que son importantes (Jonas et al. 2014). Sin embargo, la definición formalmente acordada de un OECM (&#x201C;Un área geográficamente definida que no es un Área Protegida, que se gobierna y gestiona de manera que se logran resultados positivos y sostenidos a largo plazo para la conservación in situ de la biodiversidad, con funciones y servicios de los ecosistemas asociados y, en su caso, valores culturales, espirituales, socioeconómicos y otros valores relevantes a nivel local&#x201D;) no se acordó hasta noviembre de 2018 y las medidas para que los países presenten los datos del OECM al PNUMA-WCMC son recientes. Los OECM son ahora cotejados por el PNUMA-WCMC en una base de datos separada, el WD-OECM.</p>\n<p>En lo que respecta a los lugares importantes, la mayor limitación es que la identificación de los lugares hasta la fecha se ha centrado principalmente en subconjuntos específicos de la biodiversidad, por ejemplo las aves (para las Áreas Importantes para las Aves y la Biodiversidad) y las especies altamente amenazadas (para los lugares de la Alianza para la Extinción Cero). Aunque se ha documentado que las Áreas Importantes para las Aves y la Biodiversidad son buenos sustitutos de la biodiversidad en general (Brooks et al. 2001, Pain et al. 2005), la aplicación de la norma unificada para la identificación de sitios de Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad (UICN 2016) a través de diferentes niveles de biodiversidad (genes, especies, ecosistemas) y diferentes grupos taxonómicos sigue siendo una alta prioridad, a partir de los esfuerzos realizados hasta la fecha (Eken et al. 2004, Knight et al. 2007, Langhammer et al. 2007, Foster et al. 2012). Las aves comprenden ahora el &lt;50% de las especies para las que se han identificado Áreas Clave de Biodiversidad, y a medida que avance la identificación de Áreas Clave de Biodiversidad para otros taxones y elementos de la biodiversidad, este sesgo será una consideración menos importante en el futuro.</p>\n<p>La identificación de Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad ha sido validada para una serie de países y regiones en los que los datos exhaustivos sobre la biodiversidad permiten el cálculo formal de la importancia del sitio (o &#x201C;insustituibilidad&#x201D;) utilizando técnicas de planificación sistemática de la conservación (Di Marco et al. 2016, Montesino Pouzols et al. 2014).</p>\n<p>La evolución futura del indicador incluirá: a) la ampliación de la cobertura taxonómica de las Áreas Clave de Biodiversidad de montaña mediante la aplicación de la norma de Áreas Clave de Biodiversidad (UICN 2016) a una amplia variedad de vertebrados, invertebrados, plantas y tipos de ecosistemas de montaña; b) la mejora de los datos sobre áreas protegidas mediante el aumento continuo de la proporción de sitios con fechas de designación documentadas y con polígonos de límites digitalizados (en lugar de coordenadas).</p><h1>Metodología</h1>\n<h2>Método de cálculo:</h2>\n<p>Este indicador se calcula a partir de los datos derivados de una superposición espacial entre los polígonos digitales de las áreas protegidas de la Base de Datos Mundial sobre Áreas Protegidas (PNUMA-WCMC y UICN 2020) y los polígonos digitales de las Áreas Clave de Biodiversidad de montaña (de la Base de Datos Mundial de Áreas Clave de Biodiversidad, que incluye las Áreas Importantes para las Aves y la Biodiversidad, los sitios de la Alianza para la Cero Extinción y otras Áreas Clave de Biodiversidad). Los lugares se clasificaron como Áreas Clave de Biodiversidad de montaña realizando un solapamiento espacial entre los polígonos de las Áreas Clave de Biodiversidad y una capa raster de montaña (PNUMA-WCMC 2002), clasificando cualquier Área Clave de Biodiversidad como Área Clave de Biodiversidad de montaña cuando tenía un &#x2265;5% de solapamiento con la capa de montaña. El valor del indicador en un momento dado, basado en los datos sobre el año de establecimiento del área protegida registrados en la Base de Datos Mundial sobre Áreas Protegidas, se calcula como el porcentaje medio de cada Área Clave para la Biodiversidad actualmente reconocida que está cubierta por áreas protegidas.</p>\n<p>Se desconoce el año de establecimiento del área protegida para el ~12% de las áreas protegidas en la Base de Datos Mundial sobre Áreas Protegidas, lo que genera incertidumbre en torno a la evolución de la cobertura de áreas protegidas a lo largo del tiempo. Para reflejar esta incertidumbre, se asignó aleatoriamente un año de otra área protegida dentro del mismo país, y luego se repitió este procedimiento 1000 veces, con la mediana trazada. </p>\n<p>Antes de 2017, el indicador se presentaba como el porcentaje de Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad completamente cubiertas por áreas protegidas. Sin embargo, ahora se presenta como el porcentaje medio de cada Área Clave de Biodiversidad que está cubierta por áreas protegidas con el fin de reflejar mejor las tendencias en la cobertura de áreas protegidas para los países o regiones con pocas o ninguna Área Clave de Biodiversidad que esté completamente cubierta.</p><h2>Tratamiento de valores faltantes:</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li> <strong>A nivel de país: </strong> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Se dispone de datos para las áreas protegidas y las áreas clave para la biodiversidad en todos los países del mundo, por lo que no es necesario imputar o estimar los datos a nivel nacional.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>A nivel regional y mundial:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Los indicadores globales de cobertura de áreas protegidas de lugares importantes para la biodiversidad se calculan como el porcentaje medio de cada Área Clave de Biodiversidad que está cubierta por áreas protegidas. Los datos se generan a partir de todos los países, por lo que, aunque existe incertidumbre en torno a los datos, no hay valores perdidos como tales y, por tanto, no es necesario imputarlos o estimarlos.</p><h2>Agregados regionales:</h2>\n<p>El PNUMA-WCMC es el organismo encargado de calcular y comunicar las cifras mundiales y regionales de este indicador, y colabora con BirdLife International y la UICN para combinar los datos de las áreas protegidas con los de los lugares de importancia para la biodiversidad. El PNUMA-WCMC agrega las cifras mundiales y regionales sobre áreas protegidas a partir de las cifras nacionales que se calculan a partir de la Base de Datos Mundial sobre Áreas Protegidas y se difunden a través de Protected Planet. La Base de Datos Mundial sobre Áreas Protegidas y Protected Planet son gestionados conjuntamente por el PNUMA-WCMC y la UICN y su Comisión Mundial de Áreas Protegidas. La Base de Datos Mundial sobre Áreas Protegidas se mantiene dentro de un Sistema de Información Geográfica que almacena información sobre las áreas protegidas, como su nombre, tamaño, tipo, fecha de establecimiento, ubicación geográfica (punto) y/o límites (polígono). La cobertura de áreas protegidas se calcula utilizando todas las áreas protegidas registradas en la Base de Datos Mundial sobre Áreas Protegidas cuya ubicación y extensión se conocen, aparte de las áreas protegidas sin límites digitales y los sitios que tienen un estado de &#x2018;propuesto&#x2019; o &#x2018;no informado&#x2019;.</p><h2>Métodos y directrices a disposición de los países para la compilación de los datos a nivel nacional:</h2>\n<p>La WDPA tiene su origen en un mandato de la ONU de 1959, cuando el Consejo Económico y Social de las Naciones Unidas pidió una lista de parques nacionales y reservas equivalentes Resolución 713 (XXVIII). Puede consultar más detalles aquí: <a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas</a>. </p>\n<p>La Lista de Áreas Protegidas de la ONU se ha publicado en 1961/62, 1966/71, 1972 (adición a la edición de 1966/71), 1973, 1974, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1985, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2003, 2014 y 2018, lo que ha dado lugar a una red mundial de proveedores de datos nacionales para la WDPA. Por ejemplo, en 2014 todos los puntos focales nacionales del Convenio sobre la Diversidad Biológica (CDB) y todos los puntos focales nacionales del Programa de Trabajo de Áreas Protegidas del CDB (PoWPA) para solicitar datos para la Lista Un de Áreas Protegidas de 2014 (<a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas-2014\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas-2014</a>). Por lo tanto, los datos de las áreas protegidas se compilan directamente de los organismos gubernamentales, los centros regionales y otras fuentes autorizadas en ausencia de una fuente gubernamental. Todos los registros tienen un identificador de metadatos único (MetadataID) que vincula la base de datos espacial con la tabla de fuentes donde se describen todas las fuentes. Los datos se cotejan y normalizan siguiendo las Normas de Datos de la APD y se validan con la fuente. El proceso de cotejo, validación y publicación de los datos, así como los protocolos y las normas de datos de la WDPA, se actualizan periódicamente en el Manual del usuario de la WDPA (<a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual</a>), que se pone a disposición a través de <a href=\"http://www.protectedplanet.net\">www.protectedplanet.net</a>, donde también se publican todos los datos espaciales y la tabla de fuentes cada mes y se pueden descargar. </p>\n<p>El proceso de compilación de datos sobre los lugares que contribuyen significativamente a la persistencia global de la biodiversidad (Áreas Clave de Biodiversidad) está documentado en línea (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home</a>). En concreto, (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/what-are-kbas\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/what-are-kbas</a>), el proceso de identificación de las Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad es un ejercicio altamente inclusivo, consultivo y ascendente. Aunque cualquiera que disponga de los datos científicos adecuados puede proponer un lugar para que sea calificado como Área Clave para la Biodiversidad, se requiere una amplia consulta con las partes interesadas a nivel nacional (tanto organizaciones no gubernamentales como gubernamentales) durante el proceso de propuesta. La identificación de Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad se basa en la red existente de Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad, incluidas las identificadas como Áreas Importantes para la Biodiversidad y las Aves a través de la Asociación BirdLife de 120 organizaciones nacionales <a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife-partners\">http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife-partners</a>), para la Alianza para la Extinción Cero por 93 organizaciones nacionales e internacionales (<a href=\"http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html\">http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html</a>), y como otras Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad por organizaciones de la sociedad civil apoyadas por el Fondo de la Alianza para los Ecosistemas Críticos en el desarrollo de perfiles de ecosistemas, nombrados en cada uno de los perfiles aquí enumerados (<a href=\"http://www.cepf.net/resources/publications/Pages/ecosystem_profiles.aspx\">http://www.cepf.net/resources/publications/Pages/ecosystem_profiles.aspx</a>), con nuevos datos que refuerzan y amplían la red de estos lugares. Cualquier propuesta de sitio se somete a una revisión científica independiente. A continuación, se procede a la designación oficial del lugar con una documentación completa que cumple las Normas de Documentación para Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad. Los lugares confirmados por la Secretaría de Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad como Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad aparecen entonces en el sitio web de Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home</a>).</p>\n<p>El Manual del usuario de la WDPA (<a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual</a>), publicado en inglés, español y francés, ofrece orientación a los países sobre cómo presentar los datos de las áreas protegidas a la WDPA, cuáles son los beneficios de proporcionar dichos datos, cuáles son las normas de los datos y qué controles de calidad se realizan. También ofrecemos un resumen de nuestros métodos para calcular la cobertura de áreas protegidas a todos los usuarios de la WDPA: <a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/calculating-protected-area-coverage\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/calculating-protected-area-coverage</a>. El &#x201C;Estándar global para la identificación de áreas clave para la biodiversidad&#x201D; (<a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259\">https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259</a>) comprende las recomendaciones estándar disponibles para los países en la identificación de áreas clave para la biodiversidad, con más directrices disponibles en el sitio web de áreas clave para la biodiversidad (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home</a>). En concreto, (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved</a>), los principales pasos del proceso de identificación de Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad son los siguientes </p>\n<p>i) presentación de Expresiones de Intención para identificar un Área Clave de Biodiversidad a los Puntos Focales Regionales; </p>\n<p>ii) proceso de elaboración de propuestas, en el que los proponentes compilan los datos y la documentación pertinentes y consultan a expertos nacionales, incluidas las organizaciones que ya han identificado Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad en el país, ya sea a través de los Grupos de Coordinación de Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad nacionales o de forma independiente; </p>\n<p>iii) la revisión de las Áreas Clave de Biodiversidad propuestas por parte de Revisores Expertos Independientes, verificando la exactitud de la información dentro de su área de experiencia; y </p>\n<p>iv) una fase de Nominación de Sitios que comprende la presentación de toda la documentación pertinente para su verificación por parte de la Secretaría de Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad (véase la sección 3.3 más adelante). </p>\n<p>Una vez identificada un Área Clave para la Biodiversidad, es importante el seguimiento de sus características cualificadas y su estado de conservación. Los proponentes, revisores y quienes realicen el seguimiento pueden unirse a la Comunidad de Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad para intercambiar sus experiencias, estudios de caso y ejemplos de mejores prácticas.</p><h2>Garantía de calidad:</h2>\n<p>El proceso de recolección, normalización y publicación de los datos está disponible en el Manual del usuario de la APD en <a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual</a> que está disponible en inglés, francés y español. En <a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas</a> se ofrecen orientaciones específicas sobre, por ejemplo, los campos predefinidos o las tablas de búsqueda en la WDPA: <a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-lookup-tables\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-lookup-tables</a>, cómo se codifican los registros de la WDPA, cómo se recolectan los datos de las designaciones internacionales y las designaciones regionales, con qué regularidad se actualiza la base de datos y cómo se realizan las estadísticas de cobertura de áreas protegidas. </p>\n<p>El proceso de identificación de las Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad cuenta con el apoyo de la Asociación de Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/kba-partners\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/kba-partners</a>). Entre las funciones de la asociación se encuentra el establecimiento de la Secretaría de Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad, que comprueba la información presentada en la fase de nominación del sitio para la correcta aplicación de la Norma de Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad (<a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259\">https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259</a>), y la adecuación de la documentación del sitio y luego verifica el sitio, que se publica en el sitio web de Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved</a>). Además, los presidentes de la Comisión de Supervivencia de Especies y de la Comisión Mundial de Áreas Protegidas de la UICN (ambos elegidos por los miembros de la UICN, que son gobiernos y organizaciones no gubernamentales), nombran al presidente de un Comité de Normas y Apelaciones de Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad independiente, que garantiza la correcta aplicación de la Norma Mundial para la identificación de Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad. El código R para calcular la cobertura de áreas protegidas de las Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad está documentado como Dias, M. (2017) &#x201C;Código R para calcular la cobertura de áreas protegidas de las ACB&#x201D; (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/userfiles/files/R_code_for_calculating_protected_area_coverage_of_KBAs_March_2017.pdf\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/userfiles/files/R_code_for_calculating_protected_area_coverage_of_KBAs_March_2017.pdf</a>)</p>\n<p>Además de la difusión a través del sitio web de Planeta Protegido (<a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/</a>), el proceso de la Lista de las Naciones Unidas descrito en el punto 3.1 el hecho de que los datos de las áreas protegidas se recogen de los organismos nacionales reconocidos en los metadatos de la WDPA, y el sitio web de Áreas Clave de Biodiversidad (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home</a>), los datos de Planeta Protegido y Áreas Clave de Biodiversidad se difunden a través de la Herramienta Integrada de Evaluación de la Biodiversidad, disponible para la investigación y la conservación en línea (<a href=\"https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/\">https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/</a>). Esta herramienta incorpora los documentos de los Perfiles de País de todos los países del mundo que incluyen la documentación del indicador de cobertura de áreas protegidas de las Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad. Cada actualización anual de estos Perfiles de País se envía para su consulta a los Puntos Focales Nacionales del Convenio sobre la Diversidad Biológica (<a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml\">https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml</a>), a los Representantes de los ODS de las Oficinas Nacionales de Estadística y a los representantes de las Misiones Permanentes de la ONU (Ginebra).</p><h1>Disponibilidad de datos</h1>\n<h2>Descripción:</h2>\n<p>Este indicador ha sido clasificado por el IAEG-ODS como Nivel 1. Los datos actuales están disponibles para todos los países del mundo y se actualizan de forma continua.</p>\n<h2>Series temporales:</h2>\n<p>~150 años </p>\n<h2>Desagregación:</h2>\n<p>Dado que los datos del indicador global se compilan a nivel nacional, es sencillo desagregarlos a nivel nacional y regional (por ejemplo, Han et al. 2014) o, a la inversa, agregarlos a nivel global. Las Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad abarcan todos los tipos de ecosistemas, incluidas las montañas (Rodr&#xED;guez-Rodr&#xED;guez et al. 2011). Por lo tanto, el indicador puede notificarse de forma combinada en todos los sistemas terrestres y de agua dulce, o desglosado entre ellos. Sin embargo, cada una de las Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad puede abarcar sistemas terrestres y de agua dulce (e incluso marinos) simultáneamente, por lo que la determinación de los resultados no es simplemente aditiva. Por último, el indicador puede desagregarse según las diferentes categorías de gestión de áreas protegidas (categorías I&#x2013;VI) para reflejar los diferentes objetivos de gestión específicos de las áreas protegidas.</p>\n<p>Además de la agregación de la cobertura de áreas protegidas a través de sitios importantes para la biodiversidad de las montañas como indicador hacia el ODS 15.4, otras desagregaciones de la cobertura de áreas protegidas de particular relevancia como indicadores hacia las metas de los ODS (Brooks et al. 2016) incluyen:</p>\n<p>ODS 14.5.1 Cobertura de áreas protegidas en relación con las áreas marinas.</p>\n<p>ODS 15.1.2 Proporción de sitios importantes para la biodiversidad terrestre y de agua dulce que están cubiertos por áreas protegidas, por tipo de ecosistema.</p>\n<p>Los datos de cobertura de áreas protegidas pueden combinarse con otras fuentes de datos para obtener otros indicadores complementarios. Por ejemplo, la superposición de áreas protegidas con mapas ecorregionales puede utilizarse para proporcionar información sobre la cobertura de áreas protegidas de diferentes regiones biogeográficas amplias. La cobertura de áreas protegidas de las distribuciones de diferentes grupos de especies (por ejemplo, mamíferos, aves, anfibios) puede proporcionar igualmente indicadores de las tendencias de la cobertura de la biodiversidad a nivel de especie. La cobertura de las áreas protegidas puede combinarse con el Índice de la Lista Roja para generar indicadores de los impactos de las áreas protegidas en la reducción de la pérdida de biodiversidad (Butchart et al. 2012). Por último, los indicadores derivados de la superposición de áreas protegidas también pueden informar sobre el desarrollo urbano sostenible; por ejemplo, la superposición de áreas protegidas en mapas urbanos podría proporcionar un indicador del espacio público como proporción del espacio total de la ciudad.</p><h2>Fuentes de discrepancia:</h2>\n<p>Los procesos nacionales proporcionan la mayor parte de los datos que posteriormente se agregan a la Base de Datos Mundial de Áreas Protegidas y a la Base de Datos Mundial de Áreas Clave para la Biodiversidad, por lo que hay muy pocas diferencias entre los indicadores nacionales y el global. Una fuente menor de diferencias es que la Base de Datos Mundial sobre Áreas Protegidas incorpora áreas protegidas designadas internacionalmente (por ejemplo, sitios del Patrimonio Mundial, sitios Ramsar, etc.), algunas de las cuales no son consideradas por sus naciones soberanas como áreas protegidas. </p>\n<p>Obsérvese que, dado que los países no presentan datos exhaustivos sobre las áreas protegidas desclasificadas a la WDPA, los valores anteriores del indicador pueden subestimar marginalmente la cobertura. Además, también hay un desfase entre el momento en que se designa un área protegida sobre el terreno y el momento en que se comunica a la WDPA. Por ello, la cobertura actual o reciente también puede estar subestimada.</p><h1>Referencias</h1>\n<h2>URL:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.unep-wcmc.org/\">http://www.unep-wcmc.org/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">http://www.birdlife.org/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.iucn.org/\">http://www.iucn.org/</a></p>\n<h2>Referencias:</h2>\n<p>Estos metadatos se basan en <a href=\"http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mi/wiki/7-6-Proportion-of-terrestrial-and-marine-areas-protected.ashx\">http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mi/wiki/7-6-Proportion-of-terrestrial-and-marine-areas-protected.ashx</a>, complementados por <a href=\"http://www.bipindicators.net/paoverlays%20\">http://www.bipindicators.net/paoverlays</a> y las referencias que se indican a continuación.</p>\n<p>BIRDLIFE INTERNATIONAL (2014).

Создание охраняемых районов является важным механизмом достижения этой цели, и этот показатель служит средством оценки прогресса в деле сохранения, восстановления и устойчивого использования горных экосистем и их услуг в соответствии с обязательствами по международным соглашениям. Важно отметить, что, несмотря на то, что показатель может быть дезагрегирован для отчетности по любой конкретной представляющей интерес экосистеме, он не ограничивается каким-либо одним типом экосистемы и таким образом точно отражает цель 15.1 ЦУР. </p>\n<p>Уровни доступа к охраняемым территориям различаются в зависимости от категорий управления охраняемыми территориями. Некоторые территории, такие как научные заповедники, поддерживаются в естественном состоянии и закрыты для любого иного использования. Другие территории используются для отдыха или туризма или даже открыты для устойчивой добычи природных ресурсов. Помимо защиты биоразнообразия, охраняемые территории имеют большое социальное и экономическое значение: они обеспечивают средства существования местного населения; поддерживают рыболовство; предоставляют укрытие неисчислимым богатствам генетических ресурсов; поддерживают процветающую индустрию отдыха и туризма; приносят пользу науке, исследованиям и образованию; и создают основы для культурных и других нематериальных ценностей.</p>\n<p> Этот показатель привносит значимую информацию, дополняет и строится на основе традиционно представленных простых статистических данных по горным территориям, охваченным охраняемыми территориями, и вычисляется путем деления общей площади охраняемой территории в стране на общую площадь территории страны и последующего умножения на 100 (например, Chape et al. 2005). Такое статистическое понимание охвата территорий в процентном выражении не учитывает крайних вариаций важности защиты биоразнообразия в пространственном измерении (Rodrigues et al. 2004), и, таким образом, есть риск получить неблагоприятные результаты вследствие проведения мероприятий по защите территорий, площадь которых больше, чем необходимо, за счет тех, кому защита необходима. </p>\n<p> Показатель применяется для отслеживания прогресса в достижении Стратегического плана в области сохранения и устойчивого использования биоразнообразия на 2011–2020 гг. (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al., 2014), а также использовался в качестве показателя достижения цели Конвенции о защите биологического разнообразия на 2010 год (Butchart et al. 2010) </p><h2> Комментарии и ограничения: </h2>\n<p> Критерии контроля качества применяются для обеспечения согласованности и сопоставимости данных во Всемирной базе данных по охраняемым территориям. Новые данные подвергаются валидации в Программе ООН по окружающей среде - Всемирном центре мониторинга охраны природы ООН (UNEP-WCMC) с помощью ряда инструментов и переводятся в стандартную структуру данных Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям. Расхождения между данными Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям и новыми данными сводятся к минимуму с помощью руководства (UNEP-WCMC 2019) и устраняются при общении с поставщиками данных. Аналогичные процессы применяются для включения данных в <em> Всемирную базу данных по ключевым территориям сохранения биоразнообразия </em> (BirdLife International 2019). </p>\n<p> Показатель не оценивает эффективность мер на охраняемых территориях с точки зрения сокращения потерь в биоразнообразии, что в итоге зависит от ряда факторов управления и обеспечения исполнения, не охватываемых показателем. В настоящее время проводится ряд мероприятий по устранению этого ограничения. В частности, для оценки управления охраняемыми территориями были разработаны многочисленные механизмы, которые можно синтезировать в показателе (Leverington et al. 2010). Он используется Партнерством по показателям сохранения биоразнообразия в качестве дополнительного показателя прогресса в достижении Цели 11 по сохранению биоразнообразия, упомянутой в Айтинских целевых задачах в области биоразнообразия (<a href=\"http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement\">http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement</a>). </p>\n <p>Однако связь между этими оценками и результатами деятельности на охраняемых\nтерриториях может быть не очень явной (Nolte &amp; Agrawal 2013). Совсем недавно подходы к Зеленому списку начали разрабатываться, чтобы учитывать такие факторы, как эффективность управления и результаты деятельности на охраняемых территориях, и они, вероятно, будут становиться все более важными по мере их проверки и более широкого применения.</p> <p>Пробелы в данных и знаниях могут возникнуть из-за трудностей с определением того, соответствует ли участок определению охраняемой территории МСОП, а некоторым охраняемым территориям не присвоены категории управления. Более того, другие эффективные природоохранные меры, основанные на территориальном подходе, и, как указано в целевой задаче 11 Айтинских целевых задач в области биоразнообразия Стратегического плана по сохранению и устойчивому использованию биоразнообразия на 2011-2013 гг., признают, что некоторые участки за пределами официальной сети охраняемых территорий, хотя и не управляются изначально с целью сохранения природы, тем не менее, их можно регулировать способами, которые соответствуют политике сохранения биоразнообразия, для которой они являются важными (Jonas et al. 2014). Тем не менее, официально согласованные определения OECM - инициативы \"Другая эффективная мера по сохранению биоразнообразия, основанная на территориальном подходе\" (географически определенная территория, отличная от охраняемой территории, которая регулируется и управляется таким образом, чтобы достичь положительных и устойчивых долгосрочных результатов для сохранения биоразнообразия на месте, с соответствующими экосистемными функциями и услугами, а также, где это применимо, культурными, духовными, социально-экономическими и другими значимыми на местном уровне ценностными ориентирами) были согласованы только в ноябре 2018 года, а меры по предоставлению странами данных ОЕСМ в UNEP-WCMC приняты совсем недавно. В настоящее время OECM сопоставляются Программой ООН по окружающей среде - Всемирным центром мониторинга охраны природы ООН (UNEP-WCMC) в отдельной базе данных, Всемирной базе данных инициативы \"Другая эффективная мера по сохранению биоразнообразия, основанная на территориальном подходе\" (WD-OECM). </p>\n<p> Что касается важных участков, то самым большим ограничением является то, что идентификация участков на сегодняшний день сосредоточена в основном на конкретных подмножествах биоразнообразия, например, птицах (для важных территорий орнитологического и иного биоразнообразия) и видах, находящихся под угрозой исчезновения (для территорий Альянса за предотвращение полного исчезновения). В то время как важные территории для орнитологического и иного биоразнообразия были задокументированы как подходящие заменители биоразнообразия в целом (Brooks et al. 2001, Pain et al. 2005), применение единого стандарта для определения ключевых территорий биоразнообразия (IUCN 2016) на разных уровнях биоразнообразия (гены, виды, экосистемы) и различных таксономических группах остается высокоприоритетной задачей, исходя из предпринятых на сегодняшний день усилий (Eken et al. 2004, Knight et al. 2007, Langhammer et al. 2007, Foster et al. 2012). В настоящее время птицы составляют &lt; 50% видов, для которых были определены ключевые районы биоразнообразия, и по мере того, как происходит идентификация ключевых районов биоразнообразия для других таксонов и элементов биоразнообразия, такой крен в будущем сократится.</p>\n<p> Идентификация ключевых территорий сохранения биоразнообразия была подтверждена для ряда стран и регионов, где исчерпывающие данные о биоразнообразии позволяют формально рассчитать важность (или «незаменимость») с использованием методов систематического природоохранного планирования (Di Marco et al., 2016, Montesino Pouzols et al. 2014).</p>\n<p> Дальнейшие разработки показателя будут включать: a) расширение таксономического охвата ключевых территорий сохранения горного биоразнообразия путем применения стандарта для ключевых районов биоразнообразия (МСОП 2016) к широкому спектру горных позвоночных, беспозвоночных, растений и типов экосистем; б) улучшения данных по охраняемым территориям за счет продолжения процесса по увеличению доли участков с задокументированными датами назначения полномочий и с полигонами, имеющими оцифрованные границы (а не координаты). </p><h1> Методология </h1>\n<h2> Метод расчета: </h2>\n<p> Этот показатель рассчитывается на основе данных, полученных в результате взаимного пространственного перекрытия оцифрованных полигонов для охраняемых территорий из Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям (Программа ООН по окружающей среде - Всемирный центр мониторинга охраны природы ООН (UNEP-WCMC); Международный союз охраны природы IUCN 2020) и оцифрованных полигонов для ключевых горных районов сохранения биоразнообразия (из Всемирной базы данных по ключевым территориям сохранения биоразнообразия, включая Ключевые территории сохранения орнитологического биоразнообразия, территории Альянса за предотвращение полного исчезновения и другие Ключевые районы сохранения биоразнообразия). Участки были классифицированы как горные ключевые районы сохранения биоразнообразия путем пространственного перекрытия полигонов ключевого района сохранения биоразнообразия и растрового слоя гор (UNEP-WCMC 2002), классифицируя любой ключевой район сохранения биоразнообразия как горный ключевой район сохранения биоразнообразия, если он &#x2265; на 5% перекрывается горным пластом. Значение показателя в определенный момент времени, основанное на данных по дате основания охраняемой территории, зарегистрированной во Всемирной базе данных по охраняемым территориям, рассчитывается как среднее значение в процентах каждой ключевой территории сохранения биоразнообразия, признанной в настоящее время охваченной охраняемой территорией.</p>\n<p>Год создания охраняемых территорий неизвестен для ~ 12% охраняемых территорий во Всемирной базе данных по охраняемым территориям, что порождает неопределенность в отношении изменения охвата охраняемыми территориями с течением времени. Чтобы отразить эту неопределенность, случайным образом был заимствован год от другой охраняемой территории в той же стране, а затем эта процедура была повторена 1000 раз с медианным отображением. </p>\n<p> До 2017 года показатель представлялся как процентная доля ключевых территорий сохранения биоразнообразия, полностью охваченных охраняемыми территориями. Однако теперь он представлен как среднее процентное значение каждой ключевой территории сохранения биоразнообразия, охваченной охраняемыми территориями, чтобы лучше отразить тенденции в охвате охраняемыми территориями для стран или регионов с небольшим числом полностью охваченных ключевых территорий сохранения биоразнообразия или вообще их не имеющих. </p><p> <strong> Обработка отсутствующих значений: </strong> </p>\n<ul>\n  <li> <strong> <em> На страновом уровне: </em> </strong> </li>\n</ul>\n<p> Данные доступны по охраняемым территориям и ключевым территориям сохранения биоразнообразия во всех &#x2019; странах мира, поэтому вменение или оценка данных на национальном уровне не требуется. </p>\n<ul>\n  <li> <strong> <em> На региональном и глобальном уровнях: </em> </strong> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>  Глобальные показатели охвата охраняемыми территориями участков, важных для сохранения биоразнообразия, рассчитываются как среднее процентное значение по каждой ключевой территории сохранения биоразнообразия, охваченной охраняемыми территориями. Данные получены из всех стран, поэтому, несмотря на неопределенность в отношении данных, отсутствующих значений нет как таковых, и поэтому нет необходимости во вменении или оценке значений.</p><h2> Региональные агрегаты: </h2>\n<p> Программа ООН по окружающей среде - Всемирный центр мониторинга охраны природы ООН (UNEP-WCMC) является агентством, отвечающим за расчет и представление глобальных и региональных показателей по этому показателю, работая совместно с Международной ассоциацией по защите птиц (BLI) и Международным союзом охраны природы (МСОП) над объединением данных по охраняемым территориям с данными по районам, важным для сохранения биоразнообразия. UNEP-WCMC агрегирует глобальные и региональные данные по охраняемым территориям из национальных данных, которые берутся для расчета из Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям и распространяются через визуальный интерфейс Защищенная планета. Всемирная база данных по охраняемым территориям и Защищенная планета совместно управляются Программой ООН по окружающей среде - Всемирным центром мониторинга охраны природы ООН (UNEP-WCMC) и Международным союзом охраны природы (МСОП), а также входящей в него Всемирной комиссией по охраняемым территориям. Всемирная база данных по охраняемым территориям находится в Географической информационной системе, в которой хранится информация по охраняемым территориям, такая как их название, размер, тип, дата создания, географическое месторасположение (точка) и / или граница (полигон). Охват охраняемых территорий рассчитывается с использованием информации обо всех охраняемых территориях, зарегистрированных во Всемирной базе данных по охраняемым территориям, расположение и протяженность которых известны, за исключением охраняемых территорий без оцифрованных границ и тех участков, которые имеют статус предлагаемых или по которым нет отчетности.</p><h2> Доступные странам методы и руководства для составления данных на национальном уровне: </h2>\n<p>Всемирная база данных по охраняемым территориям (WDPA) берет свое начало с мандата ООН 1959 года, когда Экономический и Социальный Совет ООН в резолюции 713 (XXVIII) призвал составить Список национальных парков и эквивалентных заповедников. Более подробная информация доступна здесь: <a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas\"> https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas</a>. Список охраняемых территорий ООН был опубликован в 1961/62, 1966/71, 1972 годах (приложение к изданию 1966/71), 1973, 1974, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1985, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2003, 2014 и 2018 годов, в результате чего была создана глобальная сеть национальных поставщиков данных для Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям (WDPA). Например, в 2014 году все национальные координационные центры Конвенции о биологическом разнообразии (CBD) и все национальные координационные центры Программы работы по Конвенции о биологическом разнообразии по охраняемым территориям (PoWPA) запрашивали данные для Списка ООН по охраняемым территориям 2014 года <a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas-2014\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas-2014</a>). Таким образом, данные по охраняемым территориям собираются непосредственно от правительственных органов, региональных центров и других авторитетных источников в отсутствие государственного источника. Все отчеты имеют уникальный идентификатор метаданных (MetadataID), который связывает пространственную базу данных с исходной таблицей, в которой описаны все источники. Данные сопоставляются и приводятся в стандартизируемую форму в соответствии со стандартами данных WDPA и проходят процесс валидации с источником. Процесс сопоставления, валидации и публикации данных, а также протоколы и стандарты данных WDPA регулярно обновляются в Руководстве пользователя WDPA (<a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual</a>) доступном по адресу <a href=\"http://www.protectedplanet.net\"> www.protectedplanet.net</a>, где все пространственные данные и исходная таблица также публикуются каждый месяц и могут быть выгружены. </p>\n<p> Процесс составления данных по сайтам, вносящим значительный вклад в сохранение биоразнообразия во всем мире (Ключевые территории сохранения биоразнообразия), задокументирован в Интернете (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home</a>). В частности, (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/what-are-kbas\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/what-are-kbas</a>) процесс идентификации ключевой территории сохранения биоразнообразия — это очень всеохватный, консультативный и восходящий вертикально-интегрированный процесс. Хотя любой человек, располагающий соответствующими научными данными, может предложить организовать участок, который квалифицируется как ключевой район сохранения биоразнообразия, в процессе подачи заявки необходимы широкие консультации с заинтересованными сторонами на национальном уровне (как неправительственными, так и правительственными организациями). Определение ключевых районов сохранения биоразнообразия основывается на существующей сети ключевых районов сохранения биоразнообразия, в том числе тех, которые определены с помощью 120 национальных организаций Партнерства по защите птиц как ключевые территории сохранения орнитологического биоразнообразия (<a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife-partners\">http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlifepartners</a>), 93 национальными и международными организациями Альянса за предотвращение полного исчезновения (<a href=\"http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html\">http://www.zeroextinction.org /partners.html</a>), а также в других ключевых областях сохранения биоразнообразия организациями гражданского общества при поддержке Фонда партнерства критических экосистем в разработке профилей экосистем, названных в каждом из перечисленных здесь профилей (<a href=\"http://www.cepf.net/resources/publications/Pages/ecosystem_profiles.aspx\">http://www.cepf.net/resources/publications/Pages/ecosystem_profiles.aspx</a>), с новым усилением и расширением данных, увеличивающих сеть этих участков. Любое предложение организации участка проходит независимую научную экспертизу. Затем следует официальная номинация участка с представлением полного пакета документации, соответствующей Стандартам по документации для ключевых областей сохранения биоразнообразия. Участки, подтвержденные секретариатом ключевых районов сохранения биоразнообразия в качестве ключевых районов сохранения биоразнообразия, затем появляются на веб-сайте ключевых районов сохранения биоразнообразия (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home</a>).</p>\n<p> Руководство пользователя Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям (<a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual</a>) опубликованное на английском, испанском и французском языках, содержит рекомендации для стран по таким вопросам, как порядок представления данные по охраняемым территориям во Всемирную базу данных по охраняемым территориям, какие имеются преимущества при предоставлении таких данных, каковы стандарты данных и какие проверки качества выполняются. Мы также предоставляем краткое изложение наших методов расчета охвата охраняемых территорий для всех пользователей Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям: <a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/calculating-protected-area-coverage\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/calculating-protected-area-coverage</a>.

В частности (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved</a>), основные этапы процесса определения ключевого района биоразнообразия следующие: </p>\n<ol>\n  <li> представление заявлений о намерениях определить ключевую область биоразнообразия\nрегиональным координационным центрам; </li>\n  <li> процесс разработки предложения, в ходе которого заявители собирают соответствующие\nданные и документацию и консультируются с национальными экспертами, включая организации, которые уже определили ключевые области биоразнообразия в стране, либо через национальные координационные группы по ключевым областям биоразнообразия, либо независимо; </li>\n  <li> обзор предложенных ключевых областей биоразнообразия независимыми экспертами-рецензентами,\nпроверка точности информации в пределах их области знаний; и </li>\n  <li> этап номинации участка, включающий представление всей соответствующей документации\nдля проверки Секретариатом ключевых территорий биоразнообразия (см. Раздел 3.3 ниже). </li> </ol>\n<p> После определения ключевого района сохранения биоразнообразия становится важным организация мониторинга его квалифицирующих характеристик и статуса сохранения. Авторы предложений, рецензенты и те, кто проводит мониторинг, могут присоединиться к Сообществу по ключевым областям сохранения биоразнообразия, чтобы обмениваться своим опытом, результатами тематических исследований и примерами передовой практики. </p><h2> Обеспечение качества: </h2>\n<p> Процесс сбора, стандартизации и публикации данных доступен в Руководстве пользователя WDPA по адресу: <a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual</a>, которое доступно на английском, французском и испанском языках. Конкретные инструкции представлены на <a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas,</a>например, по предопределенным полям или поисковым таблицам в WDPA: <a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-lookup-tables\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-lookup-tables</a>, как кодируются записи WDPA, как собираются данные о международных обозначениях и региональных обозначениях, как регулярно обновляется база данных и как составлять статистику охвата охраняемых территорий. </p>\n<p>Процесс определения ключевых территорий биоразнообразия поддерживается Партнерством по ключевым областям биоразнообразия (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/kba-partners\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/kba-partners</a>). Среди задач партнерства - создание Секретариата по ключевым областям биоразнообразия, который проверяет информацию, представленную на этапе номинации участков, на предмет правильного применения стандарта ключевых областей биоразнообразия (<a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259\">https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259</a>), а также на соответствие документации участка и затем проверяет участок, информация о котором затем публикуется на веб-сайте ключевых областей биоразнообразия. (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved</a>). Кроме того, председатели Комиссии по выживанию видов МСОП и Всемирной комиссии по охраняемым территориям (оба избираются членами МСОП, входящими в состав правительств и неправительственных организаций), назначают председателя независимого комитета по стандартам и апелляциям ключевых территорий биоразнообразия, который обеспечивает правильное применение Глобального стандарта для определения ключевых областей биоразнообразия. Код R для расчета охвата охраняемых территорий ключевых районов биоразнообразия задокументирован как Dias, M. (2017) &#x201C; код R для расчета охвата охраняемых территорий КРБ &#x201D; (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/userfiles/files/R_code_for_calculating_protected_area_coverage_of_KBAs_March_2017.pdf\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/userfiles/files/R_code_for_calculating_procted_procted_archive_archive_examples </a></p>\n<p>Помимо распространения через веб-сайт Защищенная планета (<a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/</a>), процесс составления Списка ООН разъясняет в п. 3.1 тот факт, что данные по охраняемым территориям, собранные от национальных агентств, которые названы в метаданных Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям, и на веб-сайте ключевых территорий сохранения биоразнообразия (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home</a>), данные визуального интерфейса Защищенная планета и данные по ключевым территориям сохранения биоразнообразия, распространяются с помощью Инструмента интегрированной оценки биоразнообразия, доступного для исследования и сохранения в Интернете (<a href=\"https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/\">https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/</a>). Он включает документы странового профиля для всех стран мира, в котором содержится документация по показателю охвата охраняемых территорий ключевых областей сохранения биоразнообразия. Каждое ежегодное обновление этих страновых профилей направляется для консультаций национальным координаторам Конвенции о биологическом разнообразии (<a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml\">https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml</a>), представителям национальных статистических управлений по ЦУР и представителям постоянных представительств ООН (Женева). </p><h1> Доступность данных </h1>\n<p> <strong> Описание: </strong> </p>\n<p> Этот показатель был отнесен Межучрежденческой и экспертной группой по показателям достижения целей в области устойчивого развития (МЭГ-ЦУР) к Уровню 1. Текущие данные доступны по всем странам мира и они постоянно обновляются. </p>\n<p> <strong> Временные ряды: </strong> </p>\n<p> ~ 150 лет </p>\n<p> <strong> Дезагрегирование: </strong> </p>\n<p> Учитывая, что данные для глобального показателя составляются на национальном уровне, их легко дезагрегировать до национального и регионального уровней (например, Han et al., 2014) или, наоборот, агрегировать до глобального уровня. Ключевые районы сохранения биоразнообразия охватывают все типы экосистем, включая горные (Rodr&#xED;guez-Rodr&#xED;guez et al. 2011). Таким образом, показатель может быть представлен в комбинации по наземным и пресноводным системам или в разбивке по ним. Однако отдельные ключевые районы сохранения биоразнообразия могут охватывать одновременно наземные и пресноводные (и даже морские) системы, поэтому определение результатов не является простым суммированием. Наконец, показатель может быть дезагрегирован по различным категориям управления охраняемыми территориями (категории I & # x2013; VI), чтобы отразить различные конкретные ориентиры управления охраняемыми территориями. </p>\n<p>В дополнение к агрегированию охвата охраняемых территорий по важным участкам для сохранения горного биоразнообразия в качестве показателя достижения ЦУР 15.4, другие виды дезагрегирования охвата охраняемых районов, имеющих особое значение в качестве показателей достижения целевых показателей ЦУР (Brooks et al., 2016), включают: </p>\n<p> ЦУР 14.5.1 Охват охраняемых территорий по отношению к морским районам. </p>\n<p> ЦУР 15.1.2 Доля участков, важных с точки зрения сохранения наземного и пресноводного биоразнообразия, которые входят в охраняемые районы, по типам экосистем.</p>\n<p>Данные по охвату охраняемых территорий могут быть объединены с данными из других источников для получения других дополнительных показателей. Например, взаимное перекрытие охраняемых территорий с экорегиональными картами можно использовать для предоставления информации об охвате охраняемых территорий в различных биогеографических регионах. Охват охраняемых территорий распространения различных групп видов (например, млекопитающих, птиц, земноводных) может аналогичным образом обеспечивать показатели тенденций в охвате биоразнообразия на уровне видов. Охват охраняемых территорий может быть объединен с Индексом Красного списка для получения показателей воздействия охраняемых территорий на сокращение потерь биоразнообразия (Butchart et al. 2012). Наконец, показатели, полученные на основе взаимного перекрытия охраняемых территорий, также могут быть полезны для устойчивого городского развития; например, наложение охраняемых территорий на карты городов может служить показателем доли общественного пространства в общей площади города.</p><h2> Источники расхождений: </h2>\n<p>Национальные процессы обеспечивают основную часть данных, которые впоследствии агрегируются как во Всемирную базу данных по охраняемым территориям, так и во Всемирную базу данных по ключевым районам сохранения биоразнообразия, и поэтому между национальными показателями и глобальными показателями очень мало различий. Одним из незначительных различий является то, что Всемирная база данных по охраняемым территориям включает охраняемые территории, определенные на международном уровне (например, объекты всемирного наследия ЮНЕСКО, Рамсарские угодья и т. д.), но некоторые из них не считаются в их суверенных странах охраняемыми территориями. </p>\n<p>Обратите внимание, что, поскольку страны не предоставляют во Всемирную базу данных по охраняемым территориям полные данные по официально объявленным ликвидированными охраняемым территориям, более ранние значения показателя могут незначительно занижать охват. Кроме того, существует отставание между временем, когда произошло наделение полномочиями охраняемой территории на местности, и временем, когда об этом сообщается во Всемирную базу данных по охраняемым территориям. Таким образом, текущий или предшествующий охват также может быть занижен. </p><h1> Ссылки </h1>\n<h2> URL: </h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.unep-wcmc.org/\">http://www.unep-wcmc.org/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">http://www.birdlife.org/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.iucn.org/\">http://www.iucn.org/</a></p>\n<h2>Ссылки:</h2>\n<p>Эти метаданные основаны на <a href=\"http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mi/wiki/7-6-Proportion-of-terrestrial-and-marine-areas-protected.ashx\">http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mi/wiki/7-6-Proportion-of-terrestrial-and-marine-areas-protected.ashx</a>, дополненных <a href=\"http://www.bipindicators.net/paoverlays\">http://www.bipindicators.net/paoverlays</a> и на ссылках, перечисленных ниже.</p>\n<p>BIRDLIFE INTERNATIONAL (2014).
