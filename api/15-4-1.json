The establishment of protected areas is an important mechanism for achieving this aim, and this indicator serves as a means of measuring progress toward the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of mountain ecosystems and their services, in line with obligations under international agreements. Importantly, while it can be disaggregated to report on any given single ecosystem of interest, it is not restricted to any single ecosystem type, and so faithfully reflects the intent of SDG target 15.1.</p>\n<p>Levels of access to protected areas vary among the protected area management categories. Some areas, such as scientific reserves, are maintained in their natural state and closed to any other use. Others are used for recreation or tourism, or even open for the sustainable extraction of natural resources. In addition to protecting biodiversity, protected areas have high social and economic value: supporting local livelihoods; protecting watersheds from erosion; harbouring an untold wealth of genetic resources; supporting thriving recreation and tourism industries; providing for science, research and education; and forming a basis for cultural and other non-material values.</p>\n<p>This indicator adds meaningful information to, complements and builds from traditionally reported simple statistics of mountain area covered by protected areas, computed by dividing the total protected area within a country by the total territorial area of the country and multiplying by 100 (e.g., Chape et al. 2005). Such percentage area coverage statistics do not recognise the extreme variation of biodiversity importance over space (Rodrigues et al. 2004), and so risk generating perverse outcomes through the protection of areas which are large at the expense of those which require protection.</p>\n<p>The indicator is used to track progress towards the 2011&#x2013;2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014), and was used as an indicator towards the Convention on Biological Diversity&#x2019;s 2010 Target (Butchart et al. 2010)</p><h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n<p>Quality control criteria are applied to ensure consistency and comparability of the data in the World Database on Protected Areas. New data are validated at UNEP-WCMC through a number of tools and translated into the standard data structure of the World Database on Protected Areas. Discrepancies between the data in the World Database on Protected Areas and new data are minimised by provision of a manual (UNEP-WCMC 2019) and resolved in communication with data providers. Similar processes apply for the incorporation of data into the <em>World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas</em> (BirdLife International 2019).</p>\n<p>The indicator does not measure the effectiveness of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss, which ultimately depends on a range of management and enforcement factors not covered by the indicator. A number of initiatives are underway to address this limitation. Most notably, numerous mechanisms have been developed for assessment of protected area management, which can be synthesised into an indicator (Leverington et al. 2010). This is used by the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership as a complementary indicator of progress towards Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 (<a href=\"http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement\">http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement</a>). However, there may be little relationship between these measures and protected area outcomes (Nolte &amp; Agrawal 2013). More recently, approaches to &#x201C;green listing&#x201D; have started to be developed, to incorporate both management effectiveness and the outcomes of protected areas, and these are likely to become progressively important as they are tested and applied more broadly.</p>\n<p>Data and knowledge gaps can arise due to difficulties in determining whether a site conforms to the IUCN definition of a protected area, and some protected areas are not assigned management categories. Moreover, &#x201C;other effective area-based conservation measures&#x201D;, as specified by Aichi Biodiversity Target </p>\n<p>11 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011&#x2013;2020, recognise that some sites beyond the formal protected area network, while not managed primarily for nature conservation, may nevertheless be managed in ways which are consistent with the persistence of the biodiversity for which they are important (Jonas et al. 2014). However, the formally agreed definition of an OECM (&#x201C;A geographically defined area other than a Protected Area, which is governed and managed in ways that achieve positive and sustained long-term outcomes for the in situ conservation of biodiversity, with associated ecosystem functions and services and, where applicable, cultural, spiritual, socioeconomic, and other locally relevant values&#x201D;) were only agreed in November 2018 and measures are only recently in place for countries to submit OECM data to UNEP-WCMC. OECMs are now collated by UNEP-WCMC in a separate database, the WD-OECM.</p>\n<p>Regarding important sites, the biggest limitation is that site identification to date has focused mainly on specific subsets of biodiversity, for example birds (for Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas) and highly threatened species (for Alliance for Zero Extinction sites). While Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas have been documented to be good surrogates for biodiversity more generally (Brooks et al. 2001, Pain et al. 2005), the application of the unified standard for identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (IUCN 2016) sites across different levels of biodiversity (genes, species, ecosystems) and different taxonomic groups remains a high priority, building from efforts to date (Eken et al. 2004, Knight et al. 2007, Langhammer et al. 2007, Foster et al. 2012). Birds now comprise &lt;50% of the species for which Key Biodiversity Areas have been identified, and as Key Biodiversity Area identification for other taxa and elements of biodiversity proceeds, such bias will become a less important consideration in the future.</p>\n<p>Key Biodiversity Area identification has been validated for a number of countries and regions where comprehensive biodiversity data allow formal calculation of the site importance (or &#x201C;irreplaceability&#x201D;) using systematic conservation planning techniques (Di Marco et al. 2016, Montesino Pouzols et al. 2014).</p>\n<p>Future developments of the indicator will include: a) expansion of the taxonomic coverage of mountain Key Biodiversity Areas through application of the Key Biodiversity Areas standard (IUCN 2016) to a wide variety of mountain vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and ecosystem type; b) improvements in the data on protected areas by continuing to increase the proportion of sites with documented dates of designation and with digitised boundary polygons (rather than coordinates).</p><h1>Methodology</h1>\n<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n<p>This indicator is calculated from data derived from a spatial overlap between digital polygons for protected areas from the World Database on Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC &amp; IUCN 2020) and digital polygons for mountain Key Biodiversity Areas (from the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, including Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas, Alliance for Zero Extinction sites, and other Key Biodiversity Areas). Sites were classified as mountain Key Biodiversity Areas by undertaking a spatial overlap between the Key Biodiversity Area polygons and a mountain raster layer (UNEP-WCMC 2002), classifying any Key Biodiversity Area as a mountain Key Biodiversity Area where it had &#x2265;5% overlap with the mountain layer. The value of the indicator at a given point in time, based on data on the year of protected area establishment recorded in the World Database on Protected Areas, is computed as the mean percentage of each Key Biodiversity Area currently recognised that is covered by protected areas.</p>\n<p>Year of protected area establishment is unknown for ~12% of protected areas in the World Database on Protected Areas, generating uncertainty around changing protected area coverage over time. To reflect this uncertainty, a year was randomly assigned from another protected area within the same country, and then this procedure repeated 1000 times, with the median plotted. </p>\n<p>Prior to 2017, the indicator was presented as the percentage of Key Biodiversity Areas completely covered by protected areas. However, it is now presented as the mean % of each Key Biodiversity Area that is covered by protected areas in order to better reflect trends in protected area coverage for countries or regions with few or no Key Biodiversity Areas that are completely covered.</p><h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>At country level:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Data are available for protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas in all of the world&#x2019;s countries, and so no imputation or estimation of national level data is necessary.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>At regional and global levels:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Global indicators of protected area coverage of important sites for biodiversity are calculated as the mean percentage of each Key Biodiversity Area that is covered by protected areas. The data are generated from all countries, and so while there is uncertainty around the data, there are no missing values as such and so no need for imputation or estimation.</p><h2>Regional aggregates:</h2>\n<p>UNEP-WCMC is the agency in charge of calculating and reporting global and regional figures for this indicator, working with BirdLife International and IUCN to combine data on protected areas with those for sites of importance for biodiversity. UNEP-WCMC aggregates the global and regional figures on protected areas from the national figures that are calculated from the World Database on Protected Areas and disseminated through Protected Planet. The World Database on Protected Areas and Protected Planet are jointly managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas. The World Database on Protected Areas is held within a Geographic Information System that stores information about protected areas such as their name, size, type, date of establishment, geographic location (point) and/or boundary (polygon). Protected area coverage is calculated using all the protected areas recorded in World Database on Protected Areas whose location and extent is known apart from protected areas without digital boundaries and those sites who have a status of &#x2018;proposed&#x2019; or &#x2018;not reported&#x2019;.</p><h2>Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level:</h2>\n<p>The WDPA has its origins in a 1959 UN mandate when the United Nations Economic and Social Council called for a list of national parks and equivalent reserves Resolution 713 (XXVIII). More details are available here: <a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas</a>. </p>\n<p>The UN List of Protected Areas has been published in 1961/62, 1966/71, 1972 (addendum to the 1966/71 edition), 1973, 1974, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1985, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2003, 2014 and 2018 which have resulted in a global network of national data providers for the WDPA. For example, in 2014 all Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) National Focal points and all National Focal points for the CBD Protected Areas Programme of Work (PoWPA) to request data for the 2014 Un List of Protected Areas (<a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas-2014\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas-2014</a>). Protected areas data is therefore compiled directly from government agencies, regional hubs and other authoritative sources in the absence of a government source. All records have a unique metadata identifier (MetadataID) which links the spatial database to the Source table where all sources are described. The data is collated and standardised following the WDPA Data Standards and validated with the source. The process of collation, validation and publication of data as well as protocols and the WDPA data standards are regularly updated in the WDPA User Manual (<a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual</a>) made available through <a href=\"http://www.protectedplanet.net\">www.protectedplanet.net</a> where all spatial data and the Source table are also published every month and can be downloaded. </p>\n<p>The process for compilation of data on sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity (Key Biodiversity Areas) is documented online (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home</a>). Specifically, (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/what-are-kbas\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/what-are-kbas</a>), the Key Biodiversity Area identification process is a highly inclusive, consultative and bottom-up exercise. Although anyone with appropriate scientific data may propose a site to qualify as a Key Biodiversity Area, wide consultation with stakeholders at the national level (both non-governmental and governmental organizations) is required during the proposal process. Key Biodiversity Area identification builds off the existing network of Key Biodiversity Areas, including those identified as Important Bird &amp; Biodiversity Areas through the BirdLife Partnership of 120 national organisations <a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife-partners\">http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife-partners</a>), for the Alliance for Zero Extinction by 93 national and international organisations (<a href=\"http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html\">http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html</a>), and as other Key Biodiversity Areas by civil society organisations supported by the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund in developing ecosystem profiles, named in each of the profiles listed here (<a href=\"http://www.cepf.net/resources/publications/Pages/ecosystem_profiles.aspx\">http://www.cepf.net/resources/publications/Pages/ecosystem_profiles.aspx</a>), with new data strengthening and expanding expand the network of these sites. Any site proposal undergoes independent scientific review. This is followed by the official site nomination with full documentation meeting the Documentation Standards for Key Biodiversity Areas. Sites confirmed by the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat to qualify as Key Biodiversity Areas then appear on the Key Biodiversity Areas website (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home</a>).</p>\n<p>The WDPA User Manual (<a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual</a>) published in English, Spanish, and French provides guidance to countries on how to submit protected areas data to the WDPA, what are the benefits of providing such data, which are the data standards and which quality checks are performed. We also provide a summary of our methods to calculate protected areas coverage to all WDPA users: <a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/calculating-protected-area-coverage\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/calculating-protected-area-coverage</a>. The &#x201C;Global Standard for the Identification of Key Biodiversity Areas&#x201D; (<a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259\">https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259</a>) comprises the standard recommendations available to countries in the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas, with further guidelines available on the Key Biodiversity Areas website (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home</a>). Specifically, (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved</a>), the main steps of the Key Biodiversity Area identification process are the following: </p>\n<p>i) submission of Expressions of Intent to identify a Key Biodiversity Area to Regional Focal Points; </p>\n<p>ii) proposal Development process, in which proposers compile relevant data and documentation and consult national experts, including organizations that have already identified Key Biodiversity Areas in the country, either through national Key Biodiversity Area Coordination Groups or independently; </p>\n<p>iii) review of proposed Key Biodiversity Areas by Independent Expert Reviewers, verifying the accuracy of information within their area of expertise; and </p>\n<p>iv) a Site Nomination phase comprising the submission of all the relevant documentation for verification by the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat (see section 3.3 below). </p>\n<p>Once a Key Biodiversity Area is identified, monitoring of its qualifying features and its conservation status is important. Proposers, reviewers and those undertaking monitoring can join the Key Biodiversity Areas Community to exchange their experiences, case studies and best practice examples.</p><h2>Quality assurance:</h2>\n<p>The process on how the data is collected, standardised and published is available in the WDPA User Manual at: <a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual</a> which is available in English, French and Spanish. Specific guidance is provided at <a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas</a> on, for example, predefined fields or look up tables in the WDPA: <a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-lookup-tables\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-lookup-tables</a>, how WDPA records are coded how international designations and regional designations data is collected, how regularly is the database updated, and how to perform protected areas coverage statistics. </p>\n<p>The process of identification of Key Biodiversity Areas is supported by the Key Biodiversity Areas Partnership (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/kba-partners\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/kba-partners</a>). Among the roles of the partnership is establishment of the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat, which checks information submitted in the Site Nomination phase for the correct application of the Key Biodiversity Areas Standard (<a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259\">https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259</a>), and the adequacy of site documentation and then verifies the site, which is then published on the Key Biodiversity Areas Website (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved</a>). In addition, the Chairs of the IUCN Species Survival Commission and World Commission on Protected Areas (both of whom are elected by the IUCN Membership of governments and non-governmental organisations), appoint the Chair of an independent Key Biodiversity Areas Standards and Appeals Committee, which ensures the correct application of the Global Standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas. The R code for calculating protected area coverage of Key Biodiversity Areas is documented as Dias, M. (2017) &#x201C;R code for calculating protected area coverage of KBAs&#x201D; (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/userfiles/files/R_code_for_calculating_protected_area_coverage_of_KBAs_March_2017.pdf\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/userfiles/files/R_code_for_calculating_protected_area_coverage_of_KBAs_March_2017.pdf</a>)</p>\n<p>In addition to dissemination via the Protected Planet website (<a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/</a>), the UN List process described in 3.1 the fact that protected areas data is collected from national agencies acknowledged in the WDPA metadata, and Key Biodiversity Areas website (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home</a>), Protected Planet and Key Biodiversity Areas data are disseminated through the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool, available for research and conservation online (<a href=\"https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/\">https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/</a>). This incorporates Country Profile documents for all of the world&#x2019;s countries, which includes documentation of the indicator of protected area coverage of Key Biodiversity Areas. Each annual update to these Country Profiles are sent for consultation to National Focal Points of the Convention on Biological Diversity (<a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml\">https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml</a>), National Statistics Offices SDG Representatives and UN Permanent Missions (Geneva) representatives.</p><h1>Data availability</h1>\n<h2>Description:</h2>\n<p>This indicator has been classified by the IAEG-SDGs as Tier 1. Current data are available for all countries in the world, and these are updated on an ongoing basis.</p>\n<h2>Time series:</h2>\n<p>~150 years </p>\n<h2>Disaggregation:</h2>\n<p>Given that data for the global indicator are compiled at national levels, it is straightforward to disaggregate to national and regional levels (e.g., Han et al. 2014), or conversely to aggregate to the global level. Key Biodiversity Areas span all ecosystem types, including mountains (Rodr&#xED;guez-Rodr&#xED;guez et al. 2011). The indicator can therefore be reported in combination across terrestrial and freshwater systems, or disaggregated among them. However, individual Key Biodiversity Areas can encompass terrestrial and freshwater (and indeed marine) systems simultaneously, and so determining the results is not simply additive. Finally, the indicator can be disaggregated according to different protected area management categories (categories I&#x2013;VI) to reflect differing specific management objectives of protected areas.</p>\n<p>In addition to the aggregation of the coverage of protected areas across important sites for mountain biodiversity as an indicator towards SDG 15.4, other disaggregations of coverage of protected areas of particular relevance as indicators towards SDG targets (Brooks et al. 2016) include:</p>\n<p>SDG 14.5.1 Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas.</p>\n<p>SDG 15.1.2 Proportion of important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity that are covered by protected areas, by ecosystem type.</p>\n<p>Protected area coverage data can be combined with other data sources to yield further, complementary, indicators. For example, protected area overlay with ecoregional maps can be used to provide information on protected area coverage of different broad biogeographical regions. Protected area coverage of the distributions of different groups of species (e.g., mammals, birds, amphibians) can similarly provide indicators of trends in coverage of biodiversity at the species level. Protected area coverage can be combined with the Red List Index to generate indicators of the impacts of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss (Butchart et al. 2012). Finally, indicators derived from protected area overlay can also inform sustainable urban development; for example, the overlay of protected areas onto urban maps could provide an indicator of public space as a proportion of overall city space.</p><h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>\n<p>National processes provide the great bulk of the data that are subsequently aggregated into both the World Database on Protected Areas and the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, and so there are very few differences between national indicators and the global one. One minor source of difference is that the World Database on Protected Areas incorporates internationally-designated protected areas (e.g., World Heritage sites, Ramsar sites, etc), a few of which are not considered by their sovereign nations to be protected areas. </p>\n<p>Note that because countries do not submit comprehensive data on degazetted protected areas to the WDPA, earlier values of the indictor may marginally underestimate coverage. Furthermore, there is also a lag between the point at which a protected area is designated on the ground and the point at which it is reported to the WDPA. As such, current or recent coverage may also be underestimated.</p><h1>References</h1>\n<h2>URL:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.unep-wcmc.org/\">http://www.unep-wcmc.org/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">http://www.birdlife.org/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.iucn.org/\">http://www.iucn.org/</a></p>\n<h2>References:</h2>\n<p>These metadata are based on <a href=\"http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mi/wiki/7-6-Proportion-of-terrestrial-and-marine-areas-protected.ashx\">http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mi/wiki/7-6-Proportion-of-terrestrial-and-marine-areas-protected.ashx</a>, supplemented by <a href=\"http://www.bipindicators.net/paoverlays%20\">http://www.bipindicators.net/paoverlays</a> and the references listed below.</p>\n<p>BIRDLIFE INTERNATIONAL (2014).

Создание охраняемых районов является важным механизмом достижения этой цели, и этот показатель служит средством оценки прогресса в деле сохранения, восстановления и устойчивого использования горных экосистем и их услуг в соответствии с обязательствами по международным соглашениям. Важно отметить, что, несмотря на то, что показатель может быть дезагрегирован для отчетности по любой конкретной представляющей интерес экосистеме, он не ограничивается каким-либо одним типом экосистемы и таким образом точно отражает цель 15.1 ЦУР. </p>\n<p>Уровни доступа к охраняемым территориям различаются в зависимости от категорий управления охраняемыми территориями. Некоторые территории, такие как научные заповедники, поддерживаются в естественном состоянии и закрыты для любого иного использования. Другие территории используются для отдыха или туризма или даже открыты для устойчивой добычи природных ресурсов. Помимо защиты биоразнообразия, охраняемые территории имеют большое социальное и экономическое значение: они обеспечивают средства существования местного населения; поддерживают рыболовство; предоставляют укрытие неисчислимым богатствам генетических ресурсов; поддерживают процветающую индустрию отдыха и туризма; приносят пользу науке, исследованиям и образованию; и создают основы для культурных и других нематериальных ценностей.</p>\n<p> Этот показатель привносит значимую информацию, дополняет и строится на основе традиционно представленных простых статистических данных по горным территориям, охваченным охраняемыми территориями, и вычисляется путем деления общей площади охраняемой территории в стране на общую площадь территории страны и последующего умножения на 100 (например, Chape et al. 2005). Такое статистическое понимание охвата территорий в процентном выражении не учитывает крайних вариаций важности защиты биоразнообразия в пространственном измерении (Rodrigues et al. 2004), и, таким образом, есть риск получить неблагоприятные результаты вследствие проведения мероприятий по защите территорий, площадь которых больше, чем необходимо, за счет тех, кому защита необходима. </p>\n<p> Показатель применяется для отслеживания прогресса в достижении Стратегического плана в области сохранения и устойчивого использования биоразнообразия на 2011–2020 гг. (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al., 2014), а также использовался в качестве показателя достижения цели Конвенции о защите биологического разнообразия на 2010 год (Butchart et al. 2010) </p><h2> Комментарии и ограничения: </h2>\n<p> Критерии контроля качества применяются для обеспечения согласованности и сопоставимости данных во Всемирной базе данных по охраняемым территориям. Новые данные подвергаются валидации в Программе ООН по окружающей среде - Всемирном центре мониторинга охраны природы ООН (UNEP-WCMC) с помощью ряда инструментов и переводятся в стандартную структуру данных Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям. Расхождения между данными Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям и новыми данными сводятся к минимуму с помощью руководства (UNEP-WCMC 2019) и устраняются при общении с поставщиками данных. Аналогичные процессы применяются для включения данных в <em> Всемирную базу данных по ключевым территориям сохранения биоразнообразия </em> (BirdLife International 2019). </p>\n<p> Показатель не оценивает эффективность мер на охраняемых территориях с точки зрения сокращения потерь в биоразнообразии, что в итоге зависит от ряда факторов управления и обеспечения исполнения, не охватываемых показателем. В настоящее время проводится ряд мероприятий по устранению этого ограничения. В частности, для оценки управления охраняемыми территориями были разработаны многочисленные механизмы, которые можно синтезировать в показателе (Leverington et al. 2010). Он используется Партнерством по показателям сохранения биоразнообразия в качестве дополнительного показателя прогресса в достижении Цели 11 по сохранению биоразнообразия, упомянутой в Айтинских целевых задачах в области биоразнообразия (<a href=\"http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement\">http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement</a>). </p>\n <p>Однако связь между этими оценками и результатами деятельности на охраняемых территориях может быть не очень явной (Nolte &amp; Agrawal 2013). Совсем недавно подходы к Зеленому списку начали разрабатываться, чтобы учитывать такие факторы, как эффективность управления и результаты деятельности на охраняемых территориях, и они, вероятно, будут становиться все более важными по мере их проверки и более широкого применения.</p>\n<p>Пробелы в данных и знаниях могут возникнуть из-за трудностей с определением того, соответствует ли участок определению охраняемой территории МСОП, а некоторым охраняемым территориям не присвоены категории управления. Более того, другие эффективные природоохранные меры, основанные на территориальном подходе, и, как указано в целевой задаче 11 Айтинских целевых задач в области биоразнообразия Стратегического плана по сохранению и устойчивому использованию биоразнообразия на 2011-2013 гг., признают, что некоторые участки за пределами официальной сети охраняемых территорий, хотя и не управляются изначально с целью сохранения природы, тем не менее, их можно регулировать способами, которые соответствуют политике сохранения биоразнообразия, для которой они являются важными (Jonas et al. 2014). Тем не менее, официально согласованные определения OECM - инициативы \"Другая эффективная мера по сохранению биоразнообразия, основанная на территориальном подходе\" (географически определенная территория, отличная от охраняемой территории, которая регулируется и управляется таким образом, чтобы достичь положительных и устойчивых долгосрочных результатов для сохранения биоразнообразия на месте, с соответствующими экосистемными функциями и услугами, а также, где это применимо, культурными, духовными, социально-экономическими и другими значимыми на местном уровне ценностными ориентирами) были согласованы только в ноябре 2018 года, а меры по предоставлению странами данных ОЕСМ в UNEP-WCMC приняты совсем недавно. В настоящее время OECM сопоставляются Программой ООН по окружающей среде - Всемирным центром мониторинга охраны природы ООН (UNEP-WCMC) в отдельной базе данных, Всемирной базе данных инициативы \"Другая эффективная мера по сохранению биоразнообразия, основанная на территориальном подходе\" (WD-OECM). </p>\n<p> Что касается важных участков, то самым большим ограничением является то, что идентификация участков на сегодняшний день сосредоточена в основном на конкретных подмножествах биоразнообразия, например, птицах (для важных территорий орнитологического и иного биоразнообразия) и видах, находящихся под угрозой исчезновения (для территорий Альянса за предотвращение полного исчезновения). В то время как важные территории для орнитологического и иного биоразнообразия были задокументированы как подходящие заменители биоразнообразия в целом (Brooks et al. 2001, Pain et al. 2005), применение единого стандарта для определения ключевых территорий биоразнообразия (IUCN 2016) на разных уровнях биоразнообразия (гены, виды, экосистемы) и различных таксономических группах остается высокоприоритетной задачей, исходя из предпринятых на сегодняшний день усилий (Eken et al. 2004, Knight et al. 2007, Langhammer et al. 2007, Foster et al. 2012). В настоящее время птицы составляют &lt; 50% видов, для которых были определены ключевые районы биоразнообразия, и по мере того, как происходит идентификация ключевых районов биоразнообразия для других таксонов и элементов биоразнообразия, такой крен в будущем сократится.</p>\n<p> Идентификация ключевых территорий сохранения биоразнообразия была подтверждена для ряда стран и регионов, где исчерпывающие данные о биоразнообразии позволяют формально рассчитать важность (или «незаменимость») с использованием методов систематического природоохранного планирования (Di Marco et al., 2016, Montesino Pouzols et al. 2014).</p>\n<p> Дальнейшие разработки показателя будут включать: a) расширение таксономического охвата ключевых территорий сохранения горного биоразнообразия путем применения стандарта для ключевых районов биоразнообразия (МСОП 2016) к широкому спектру горных позвоночных, беспозвоночных, растений и типов экосистем; б) улучшения данных по охраняемым территориям за счет продолжения процесса по увеличению доли участков с задокументированными датами назначения полномочий и с полигонами, имеющими оцифрованные границы (а не координаты). </p><h1> Методология </h1>\n<h2> Метод расчета: </h2>\n<p> Этот показатель рассчитывается на основе данных, полученных в результате взаимного пространственного перекрытия оцифрованных полигонов для охраняемых территорий из Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям (Программа ООН по окружающей среде - Всемирный центр мониторинга охраны природы ООН (UNEP-WCMC); Международный союз охраны природы IUCN 2020) и оцифрованных полигонов для ключевых горных районов сохранения биоразнообразия (из Всемирной базы данных по ключевым территориям сохранения биоразнообразия, включая Ключевые территории сохранения орнитологического биоразнообразия, территории Альянса за предотвращение полного исчезновения и другие Ключевые районы сохранения биоразнообразия). Участки были классифицированы как горные ключевые районы сохранения биоразнообразия путем пространственного перекрытия полигонов ключевого района сохранения биоразнообразия и растрового слоя гор (UNEP-WCMC 2002), классифицируя любой ключевой район сохранения биоразнообразия как горный ключевой район сохранения биоразнообразия, если он &#x2265; на 5% перекрывается горным пластом. Значение показателя в определенный момент времени, основанное на данных по дате основания охраняемой территории, зарегистрированной во Всемирной базе данных по охраняемым территориям, рассчитывается как среднее значение в процентах каждой ключевой территории сохранения биоразнообразия, признанной в настоящее время охваченной охраняемой территорией.</p>\n<p>Год создания охраняемых территорий неизвестен для ~ 12% охраняемых территорий во Всемирной базе данных по охраняемым территориям, что порождает неопределенность в отношении изменения охвата охраняемыми территориями с течением времени. Чтобы отразить эту неопределенность, случайным образом был заимствован год от другой охраняемой территории в той же стране, а затем эта процедура была повторена 1000 раз с медианным отображением. </p>\n<p> До 2017 года показатель представлялся как процентная доля ключевых территорий сохранения биоразнообразия, полностью охваченных охраняемыми территориями. Однако теперь он представлен как среднее процентное значение каждой ключевой территории сохранения биоразнообразия, охваченной охраняемыми территориями, чтобы лучше отразить тенденции в охвате охраняемыми территориями для стран или регионов с небольшим числом полностью охваченных ключевых территорий сохранения биоразнообразия или вообще их не имеющих. </p><p> <strong> Обработка отсутствующих значений: </strong> </p>\n<ul>\n  <li> <strong> <em> На страновом уровне: </em> </strong> </li>\n</ul>\n<p> Данные доступны по охраняемым территориям и ключевым территориям сохранения биоразнообразия во всех &#x2019; странах мира, поэтому вменение или оценка данных на национальном уровне не требуется. </p>\n<ul>\n  <li> <strong> <em> На региональном и глобальном уровнях: </em> </strong> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>  Глобальные показатели охвата охраняемыми территориями участков, важных для сохранения биоразнообразия, рассчитываются как среднее процентное значение по каждой ключевой территории сохранения биоразнообразия, охваченной охраняемыми территориями. Данные получены из всех стран, поэтому, несмотря на неопределенность в отношении данных, отсутствующих значений нет как таковых, и поэтому нет необходимости во вменении или оценке значений.</p><h2> Региональные агрегаты: </h2>\n<p> Программа ООН по окружающей среде - Всемирный центр мониторинга охраны природы ООН (UNEP-WCMC) является агентством, отвечающим за расчет и представление глобальных и региональных показателей по этому показателю, работая совместно с Международной ассоциацией по защите птиц (BLI) и Международным союзом охраны природы (МСОП) над объединением данных по охраняемым территориям с данными по районам, важным для сохранения биоразнообразия. UNEP-WCMC агрегирует глобальные и региональные данные по охраняемым территориям из национальных данных, которые берутся для расчета из Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям и распространяются через визуальный интерфейс Защищенная планета. Всемирная база данных по охраняемым территориям и Защищенная планета совместно управляются Программой ООН по окружающей среде - Всемирным центром мониторинга охраны природы ООН (UNEP-WCMC) и Международным союзом охраны природы (МСОП), а также входящей в него Всемирной комиссией по охраняемым территориям. Всемирная база данных по охраняемым территориям находится в Географической информационной системе, в которой хранится информация по охраняемым территориям, такая как их название, размер, тип, дата создания, географическое месторасположение (точка) и / или граница (полигон). Охват охраняемых территорий рассчитывается с использованием информации обо всех охраняемых территориях, зарегистрированных во Всемирной базе данных по охраняемым территориям, расположение и протяженность которых известны, за исключением охраняемых территорий без оцифрованных границ и тех участков, которые имеют статус предлагаемых или по которым нет отчетности.</p><h2> Доступные странам методы и руководства для составления данных на национальном уровне: </h2>\n<p>Всемирная база данных по охраняемым территориям (WDPA) берет свое начало с мандата ООН 1959 года, когда Экономический и Социальный Совет ООН в резолюции 713 (XXVIII) призвал составить Список национальных парков и эквивалентных заповедников. Более подробная информация доступна здесь: <a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas\"> https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas</a>. Список охраняемых территорий ООН был опубликован в 1961/62, 1966/71, 1972 годах (приложение к изданию 1966/71), 1973, 1974, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1985, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2003, 2014 и 2018 годов, в результате чего была создана глобальная сеть национальных поставщиков данных для Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям (WDPA). Например, в 2014 году все национальные координационные центры Конвенции о биологическом разнообразии (CBD) и все национальные координационные центры Программы работы по Конвенции о биологическом разнообразии по охраняемым территориям (PoWPA) запрашивали данные для Списка ООН по охраняемым территориям 2014 года <a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas-2014\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas-2014</a>). Таким образом, данные по охраняемым территориям собираются непосредственно от правительственных органов, региональных центров и других авторитетных источников в отсутствие государственного источника. Все отчеты имеют уникальный идентификатор метаданных (MetadataID), который связывает пространственную базу данных с исходной таблицей, в которой описаны все источники. Данные сопоставляются и приводятся в стандартизируемую форму в соответствии со стандартами данных WDPA и проходят процесс валидации с источником. Процесс сопоставления, валидации и публикации данных, а также протоколы и стандарты данных WDPA регулярно обновляются в Руководстве пользователя WDPA (<a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual</a>) доступном по адресу <a href=\"http://www.protectedplanet.net\"> www.protectedplanet.net</a>, где все пространственные данные и исходная таблица также публикуются каждый месяц и могут быть выгружены. </p>\n<p> Процесс составления данных по сайтам, вносящим значительный вклад в сохранение биоразнообразия во всем мире (Ключевые территории сохранения биоразнообразия), задокументирован в Интернете (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home</a>). В частности, (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/what-are-kbas\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/what-are-kbas</a>) процесс идентификации ключевой территории сохранения биоразнообразия — это очень всеохватный, консультативный и восходящий вертикально-интегрированный процесс. Хотя любой человек, располагающий соответствующими научными данными, может предложить организовать участок, который квалифицируется как ключевой район сохранения биоразнообразия, в процессе подачи заявки необходимы широкие консультации с заинтересованными сторонами на национальном уровне (как неправительственными, так и правительственными организациями). Определение ключевых районов сохранения биоразнообразия основывается на существующей сети ключевых районов сохранения биоразнообразия, в том числе тех, которые определены с помощью 120 национальных организаций Партнерства по защите птиц как ключевые территории сохранения орнитологического биоразнообразия (<a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife-partners\">http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlifepartners</a>), 93 национальными и международными организациями Альянса за предотвращение полного исчезновения (<a href=\"http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html\">http://www.zeroextinction.org /partners.html</a>), а также в других ключевых областях сохранения биоразнообразия организациями гражданского общества при поддержке Фонда партнерства критических экосистем в разработке профилей экосистем, названных в каждом из перечисленных здесь профилей (<a href=\"http://www.cepf.net/resources/publications/Pages/ecosystem_profiles.aspx\">http://www.cepf.net/resources/publications/Pages/ecosystem_profiles.aspx</a>), с новым усилением и расширением данных, увеличивающих сеть этих участков. Любое предложение организации участка проходит независимую научную экспертизу. Затем следует официальная номинация участка с представлением полного пакета документации, соответствующей Стандартам по документации для ключевых областей сохранения биоразнообразия. Участки, подтвержденные секретариатом ключевых районов сохранения биоразнообразия в качестве ключевых районов сохранения биоразнообразия, затем появляются на веб-сайте ключевых районов сохранения биоразнообразия (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home</a>).</p>\n<p> Руководство пользователя Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям (<a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual</a>) опубликованное на английском, испанском и французском языках, содержит рекомендации для стран по таким вопросам, как порядок представления данные по охраняемым территориям во Всемирную базу данных по охраняемым территориям, какие имеются преимущества при предоставлении таких данных, каковы стандарты данных и какие проверки качества выполняются. Мы также предоставляем краткое изложение наших методов расчета охвата охраняемых территорий для всех пользователей Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям: <a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/calculating-protected-area-coverage\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/calculating-protected-area-coverage</a>. Глобальный стандарт определения ключевых областей сохранения биоразнообразия (<a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259\">https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259</a>) содержит стандартные рекомендации, доступные странам в определении ключевых областей сохранения биоразнообразия, с дополнительными руководящими указаниями, доступными на веб-сайте ключевых областей биоразнообразия (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home(</a>). В частности (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved</a>), основные этапы процесса определения ключевого района биоразнообразия следующие: </p>\n<ol>\n  <li> представление заявлений о намерениях определить ключевую область биоразнообразия региональным координационным центрам; </li>\n  <li> процесс разработки предложения, в ходе которого заявители собирают соответствующие данные и документацию и консультируются с национальными экспертами, включая организации, которые уже определили ключевые области биоразнообразия в стране, либо через национальные координационные группы по ключевым областям биоразнообразия, либо независимо; </li>\n  <li> обзор предложенных ключевых областей биоразнообразия независимыми экспертами-рецензентами, проверка точности информации в пределах их области знаний; и </li>\n  <li> этап номинации участка, включающий представление всей соответствующей документации для проверки Секретариатом ключевых территорий биоразнообразия (см. Раздел 3.3 ниже). </li>\n</ol>\n<p> После определения ключевого района сохранения биоразнообразия становится важным организация мониторинга его квалифицирующих характеристик и статуса сохранения. Авторы предложений, рецензенты и те, кто проводит мониторинг, могут присоединиться к Сообществу по ключевым областям сохранения биоразнообразия, чтобы обмениваться своим опытом, результатами тематических исследований и примерами передовой практики. </p><h2> Обеспечение качества: </h2>\n<p> Процесс сбора, стандартизации и публикации данных доступен в Руководстве пользователя WDPA по адресу: <a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual</a>, которое доступно на английском, французском и испанском языках. Конкретные инструкции представлены на <a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas,</a>например, по предопределенным полям или поисковым таблицам в WDPA: <a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-lookup-tables\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-lookup-tables</a>, как кодируются записи WDPA, как собираются данные о международных обозначениях и региональных обозначениях, как регулярно обновляется база данных и как составлять статистику охвата охраняемых территорий. </p>\n<p>Процесс определения ключевых территорий биоразнообразия поддерживается Партнерством по ключевым областям биоразнообразия (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/kba-partners\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/kba-partners</a>). Среди задач партнерства - создание Секретариата по ключевым областям биоразнообразия, который проверяет информацию, представленную на этапе номинации участков, на предмет правильного применения стандарта ключевых областей биоразнообразия (<a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259\">https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259</a>), а также на соответствие документации участка и затем проверяет участок, информация о котором затем публикуется на веб-сайте ключевых областей биоразнообразия. (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved</a>). Кроме того, председатели Комиссии по выживанию видов МСОП и Всемирной комиссии по охраняемым территориям (оба избираются членами МСОП, входящими в состав правительств и неправительственных организаций), назначают председателя независимого комитета по стандартам и апелляциям ключевых территорий биоразнообразия, который обеспечивает правильное применение Глобального стандарта для определения ключевых областей биоразнообразия. Код R для расчета охвата охраняемых территорий ключевых районов биоразнообразия задокументирован как Dias, M. (2017) &#x201C; код R для расчета охвата охраняемых территорий КРБ &#x201D; (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/userfiles/files/R_code_for_calculating_protected_area_coverage_of_KBAs_March_2017.pdf\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/userfiles/files/R_code_for_calculating_procted_procted_archive_archive_examples </a></p>\n<p>Помимо распространения через веб-сайт Защищенная планета (<a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/\">https://www.protectedplanet.net/</a>), процесс составления Списка ООН разъясняет в п. 3.1 тот факт, что данные по охраняемым территориям, собранные от национальных агентств, которые названы в метаданных Всемирной базы данных по охраняемым территориям, и на веб-сайте ключевых территорий сохранения биоразнообразия (<a href=\"http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home\">http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home</a>), данные визуального интерфейса Защищенная планета и данные по ключевым территориям сохранения биоразнообразия, распространяются с помощью Инструмента интегрированной оценки биоразнообразия, доступного для исследования и сохранения в Интернете (<a href=\"https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/\">https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/</a>). Он включает документы странового профиля для всех стран мира, в котором содержится документация по показателю охвата охраняемых территорий ключевых областей сохранения биоразнообразия. Каждое ежегодное обновление этих страновых профилей направляется для консультаций национальным координаторам Конвенции о биологическом разнообразии (<a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml\">https://www.cbd.int/information/nfp.shtml</a>), представителям национальных статистических управлений по ЦУР и представителям постоянных представительств ООН (Женева). </p><h1> Доступность данных </h1>\n<p> <strong> Описание: </strong> </p>\n<p> Этот показатель был отнесен Межучрежденческой и экспертной группой по показателям достижения целей в области устойчивого развития (МЭГ-ЦУР) к Уровню 1. Текущие данные доступны по всем странам мира и они постоянно обновляются. </p>\n<p> <strong> Временные ряды: </strong> </p>\n<p> ~ 150 лет </p>\n<p> <strong> Дезагрегирование: </strong> </p>\n<p> Учитывая, что данные для глобального показателя составляются на национальном уровне, их легко дезагрегировать до национального и регионального уровней (например, Han et al., 2014) или, наоборот, агрегировать до глобального уровня. Ключевые районы сохранения биоразнообразия охватывают все типы экосистем, включая горные (Rodr&#xED;guez-Rodr&#xED;guez et al. 2011). Таким образом, показатель может быть представлен в комбинации по наземным и пресноводным системам или в разбивке по ним. Однако отдельные ключевые районы сохранения биоразнообразия могут охватывать одновременно наземные и пресноводные (и даже морские) системы, поэтому определение результатов не является простым суммированием. Наконец, показатель может быть дезагрегирован по различным категориям управления охраняемыми территориями (категории I & # x2013; VI), чтобы отразить различные конкретные ориентиры управления охраняемыми территориями. </p>\n<p>В дополнение к агрегированию охвата охраняемых территорий по важным участкам для сохранения горного биоразнообразия в качестве показателя достижения ЦУР 15.4, другие виды дезагрегирования охвата охраняемых районов, имеющих особое значение в качестве показателей достижения целевых показателей ЦУР (Brooks et al., 2016), включают: </p>\n<p> ЦУР 14.5.1 Охват охраняемых территорий по отношению к морским районам. </p>\n<p> ЦУР 15.1.2 Доля участков, важных с точки зрения сохранения наземного и пресноводного биоразнообразия, которые входят в охраняемые районы, по типам экосистем.</p>\n<p>Данные по охвату охраняемых территорий могут быть объединены с данными из других источников для получения других дополнительных показателей. Например, взаимное перекрытие охраняемых территорий с экорегиональными картами можно использовать для предоставления информации об охвате охраняемых территорий в различных биогеографических регионах. Охват охраняемых территорий распространения различных групп видов (например, млекопитающих, птиц, земноводных) может аналогичным образом обеспечивать показатели тенденций в охвате биоразнообразия на уровне видов. Охват охраняемых территорий может быть объединен с Индексом Красного списка для получения показателей воздействия охраняемых территорий на сокращение потерь биоразнообразия (Butchart et al. 2012). Наконец, показатели, полученные на основе взаимного перекрытия охраняемых территорий, также могут быть полезны для устойчивого городского развития; например, наложение охраняемых территорий на карты городов может служить показателем доли общественного пространства в общей площади города.</p><h2> Источники расхождений: </h2>\n<p>Национальные процессы обеспечивают основную часть данных, которые впоследствии агрегируются как во Всемирную базу данных по охраняемым территориям, так и во Всемирную базу данных по ключевым районам сохранения биоразнообразия, и поэтому между национальными показателями и глобальными показателями очень мало различий. Одним из незначительных различий является то, что Всемирная база данных по охраняемым территориям включает охраняемые территории, определенные на международном уровне (например, объекты всемирного наследия ЮНЕСКО, Рамсарские угодья и т. д.), но некоторые из них не считаются в их суверенных странах охраняемыми территориями. </p>\n<p>Обратите внимание, что, поскольку страны не предоставляют во Всемирную базу данных по охраняемым территориям полные данные по официально объявленным ликвидированными охраняемым территориям, более ранние значения показателя могут незначительно занижать охват. Кроме того, существует отставание между временем, когда произошло наделение полномочиями охраняемой территории на местности, и временем, когда об этом сообщается во Всемирную базу данных по охраняемым территориям. Таким образом, текущий или предшествующий охват также может быть занижен. </p><h1> Ссылки </h1>\n<h2> URL: </h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.unep-wcmc.org/\">http://www.unep-wcmc.org/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">http://www.birdlife.org/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.iucn.org/\">http://www.iucn.org/</a></p>\n<h2>Ссылки:</h2>\n<p>Эти метаданные основаны на <a href=\"http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mi/wiki/7-6-Proportion-of-terrestrial-and-marine-areas-protected.ashx\">http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mi/wiki/7-6-Proportion-of-terrestrial-and-marine-areas-protected.ashx</a>, дополненных <a href=\"http://www.bipindicators.net/paoverlays\">http://www.bipindicators.net/paoverlays</a> и на ссылках, перечисленных ниже.</p>\n<p>BIRDLIFE INTERNATIONAL (2014).
