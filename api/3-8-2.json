In effect it is based on a ratio exceeding a threshold. The two main concepts of interest behind this ratio are household expenditure on health (numerator) and total household consumption expenditure or, when unavailable, income (denominator). </p>\n<p><strong><em>Numerator</em></strong></p>\n<p>Household expenditure on health is defined as any expenditure incurred at the time of service use to get any type of care (promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long-term care) including all medicines, vaccines and other pharmaceutical preparations as well as all health products, <em>from any type of provider and for all members of the household</em>. These health expenditures are characterized by a direct payments that are financed by a household&#x2019;s income (including remittances), savings or loans <strong>but do not include any third-party payer reimbursement. </strong>As such they only grant access to the health services and health products individuals can pay for, without any solidarity between the healthy and the sick beyond the household<sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-ref-1\">[1]</a></sup> and solely based on the willingness and ability of the household to pay. Direct health care payments are labelled Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) payments in the classification of health care financing schemes (HF) of the international Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA). OOP health expenditures are the most unequitable source of funding for the health system. </p>\n<p>The components of a household&#x2019;s health care consumption expenditure so defined should be consistent with division 06 on health of the UN Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP) which currently includes expenditures on medicines and medical products (06.1), outpatient care services (06.2) and inpatient care services (06.3) but is being expanded<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[2]</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Further information on definitions and classifications (for example by provider, by beneficiary characteristics) of health expenditures should be consistent with the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/health-accounts/methodology/en/\">international classification for health accounts</a> and its family of classifications. ICHA results from collaboration between OECD, Eurostat and the World Health Organization. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Denominator</em></strong></p>\n<p>Expenditure on household consumption and household income are both monetary welfare measures. Household consumption is a function of permanent income, which is a measure of a household&#x2019;s long-term economic resources that determine living standards. Consumption is generally defined as the sum of the monetary values of all items (goods and services) consumed by the household on domestic account during a reference period. It includes the imputed values of goods and services that are not purchased but procured otherwise for consumption. Information on household consumption is usually collected in household surveys that may use different approaches to measure &#x2018;consumption&#x2019; depending on whether items refer to durable or non-durable goods and/or are directly produced by households.</p>\n<p>The most relevant measure of income is disposable income as it is close to the maximum available to the household for consumption expenditure during the accounting period. Disposable income is defined as total income less direct taxes (net of refunds), compulsory fees and fines. Total income is generally composed of income from employment, property income, income from household production of services for own consumption, transfers received in cash and goods, transfers received as services<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[3]</a></sup>. </p>\n<p>Income is more difficult to measure accurately due to its greater variability over time. Consumption is less variable over time and easier to measure. It is therefore recommended that whenever there is information on both household consumption and income the former is used (see the &#x201C;comments and limitations&#x201D; section to learn more about the sensitivity of 3.8.2 to the income/expenditure choice in the denominator). Statistics on 3.8.2 currently produced by WHO and the World Bank predominantly rely on consumption (see section on data sources). </p>\n<p><strong><em>Thresholds</em></strong></p>\n<p>It is recommended to use two thresholds for global reporting to identify large household expenditure on health as share of total household consumption or income<u>: </u><strong><u>a lower threshold of 10% (3.8.2_10) and a higher threshold of 25% (3.8.2_25)</u></strong>. With these two thresholds the indicator measures financial hardship </p>\n<p> (see section on comments and limitations). </p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-1\">1</sup><p> <a href=\"http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/a-system-of-health-accounts/classification-of-health-care-financing-schemes-icha-hf_9789264116016-9-en\">http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/a-system-of-health-accounts/classification-of-health-care-financing-schemes-icha-hf_9789264116016-9-en</a>   <a href=\"#footnote-ref-1\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">2</sup><p> Agenda item 3(l) available at <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/49th-session/documents/\">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/49th-session/documents/</a>; <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcs.asp?Cl=5&amp;Lg=1&amp;Co=06.1\">http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcs.asp?Cl=5&amp;Lg=1&amp;Co=06.1</a>  <a href=\"#footnote-ref-2\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-3\">3</sup><p> <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/download/17thicls/r2hies.pdf\">http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/download/17thicls/r2hies.pdf</a>   <a href=\"#footnote-ref-3\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div><h1>Data sources</h1>\n<h2>Description:</h2>\n<p>The recommended data sources for the monitoring of the &#x201C;Proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income&#x201D; are household surveys with information on both household consumption expenditure on health and total household consumption expenditures, which are routinely conducted by national statistical offices. Household budget surveys (HBS) and household income and expenditure surveys (HIES) typically collect these as they are primarily conducted to provide inputs to the calculation of consumer price indices or the compilation of national accounts. Another potential source of information is socio-economic or living standards surveys; however, some of these surveys may not collect information on total household consumption expenditures &#x2013; for example, when a country measures poverty using income as the welfare measure<sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-ref-4\">[4]</a></sup>. The most important criterion for selecting a data source to measure SDG indicator 3.8.2 is the availability of both household consumption expenditure on health and total household consumption expenditures.</p>\n<p>When socio-economic or living standards surveys are used to measure SDG indicator 3.8.2, any challenge for cross-country comparability of SDG Indicator 1.1.1 also applies to the monitoring of SDG indicator 3.8.2. For any type of household survey, given the focus on household health expenditure there is a need to improve the current survey instruments for cross-country comparability. The World Health Organization is collaborating with different UN agencies and other important stakeholder to ensure this happens<sup><a href=\"#footnote-5\" id=\"footnote-ref-5\">[5]</a></sup>.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-4\">4</sup><p><sup> </sup><a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf\">http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf</a> <a href=\"#footnote-ref-4\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-5\">5</sup><p> One example is the WHO engagement in the ongoing revision of COICOP by UNSD  <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/class/revisions/coicop_revision.asp\">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/class/revisions/coicop_revision.asp</a> . Another example is a BMGF project WHO is supporting  to improve the measurement of household health expenditures  <a href=\"http://www.indepth-network.org/projects/ihope\">http://www.indepth-network.org/projects/ihope</a>       <a href=\"#footnote-ref-5\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div><h2>Collection process:</h2>\n<p>WHO obtains household survey data from national statistical offices where the denominator and numerator of the health expenditure ratio is constructed following their own guidelines either directly by them or by WHO consultants. WHO works through its regional offices or country offices to obtain access to data. No systematic adjustment is undertaken. </p>\n<p>The World Bank also typically receives data from National Statistical Offices (NSOs) directly. In other cases it uses NSO data received indirectly. For example, it receives data from Eurostat and from LIS (Luxembourg Income Study), who provide the World Bank NSO data they have received / harmonized. The Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina and the World Bank jointly maintain the SEDLAC (Socio-Economic Database for Latin American and Caribbean) database that includes harmonized statistics on poverty and other distributional and social variables from 24 Latin American and Caribbean countries, based on microdata from household surveys conducted by NSOs. Data is obtained through country specific programs, including technical assistance programs and joint analytical and capacity building activities. The World Bank has relationships with NSOs on work programs involving statistical systems and data analysis. Poverty economists from the World Bank typically engage with NSOs broadly on poverty measurement and analysis as part of technical assistance activities. </p>\n<p>The World Health Organization and the World Bank generate indicator 3.8.2 following the same approach (see methodology). Both institutions combine estimates at the meso-level. Eligibility of the estimates included in a joint global database for the production of regional and global estimates is based on the following quality checks:</p>\n<p><em>For the denominator of the health expenditure ratio</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Compare the logarithm of total per capita consumption in a benchmark source with the logarithm of total per capita consumption estimated from the survey. Both are expressed on a monthly basis in 2011 international (PPP) $. The benchmark source is taken from Povcalnet<sup><a href=\"#footnote-6\" id=\"footnote-ref-6\">[6]</a></sup> if available, and otherwise from the World Development Indicators (WDI)<sup><a href=\"#footnote-7\" id=\"footnote-ref-7\">[7]</a></sup>, computed as the household final consumption expenditures in constant 2011 international divided by total population. When the difference between the logarithm of total per capita consumption in the benchmark source and the logarithm of the value estimated from the survey as a share of the logarithm of total per capita consumption in the benchmark is greater than 10% when the comparison is with PovcalNet and greater than 15% when the comparison is made with the WDI the survey point is identified as an outlier internationally in terms of consumption per capita. </li>\n  <li>Compare the poverty headcount estimated from the survey at the $1.90 a day poverty line in 2011 PPPs with the poverty incidence reported in PovcalNet at the same poverty line (benchmark value). When the absolute difference between the benchmark value and the survey estimate exceeds 10 percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in the incidence of extreme poverty and flagged for possible exclusion. </li>\n  <li>Compare the poverty headcount estimated from the survey at the $3.10 a day poverty line in 2011 PPPs with the poverty incidence reported in PovcalNet at the same poverty line (benchmark value). When the absolute difference between the benchmark value and the survey estimate exceeds 10 percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in poverty headcount at $3.10 a day and flagged for possible exclusion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>For the numerator of the health expenditure ratio</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Compare the average health expenditure ratio in the survey to a benchmark average budget share constructed as the ratio of the aggregate measure of household out-of-pocket expenditures in current local currency and aggregate household final consumption expenditure in current local currency. When the absolute difference exceeds 5 percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in terms of household budget share spent on health and flagged for possible exclusion. The macro-indicator of household out-of-pocket expenditures is available from the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/health-accounts/ghed/en/\">Global Health Expenditure Database</a> (GHED)<sup><a href=\"#footnote-8\" id=\"footnote-ref-8\">[8]</a></sup> and the <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators\">World Development Indicators Database</a> (WDI)<sup><a href=\"#footnote-9\" id=\"footnote-ref-9\">[9]</a></sup>. Information on household final consumption expenditure is also extracted from WDI (series code: NE.CON.PRVT.CN).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These benchmarks are also used to decide between two estimates for those countries and those years for which both institutions have the same data source. For more information please refer to WHO and World Bank 2017 report on tracking universal health coverage as well as Wagstaff et al 2018. </p>\n<p>At the end of the quality assurance process, WHO and the World Bank assemble non-duplicated estimates of the proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income for each country. The World Health Organization then undertakes a country consultation process. Following a WHO Executive Board resolution (EB107.R8) WHO is requested to do this before publishing estimates at country level on behalf of member states. For any given indicator, this process starts with WHO sending a formal request to ministries of health to nominate a focal point for the consultation on the indicator. Once member states nominate focal points, WHO then sends draft estimates and methodological descriptions to them. STATA codes are available to reproduce the estimates shared. The focal points then send to WHO their comments, often including new data or revised country estimates that are used to update the country estimates. During the 2017 country consultation 137 WHO Member States nominated focal points, 100 of these received draft estimates and information on the methodology; 37 received only information on methodology as no draft estimate was produced. Of the 57 WHO Member States without focal points nominated estimates are available for 32 of them.</p>\n<p>In addition to such consultation, the World Health Organization and the World Bank regularly undertake training events on the measurement of lack of financial protection coverage, which involves participants from the Ministry of Health as well as from the National Statistical Office. WHO has several regional and national collaborations ongoing to support the production of indicator 3.8.2 as it has been recently adopted it is not yet routinely produced by National Statistical Office despite the data being available and the methodology simple. Results of such collaborations are not yet included in the database assembled by WHO and the World Bank but estimates produced by a country will be subject to the same quality assurance process just described.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-6\">6</sup><p> <a href=\"http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/povOnDemand.aspx\">http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/povOnDemand.aspx</a>  <a href=\"#footnote-ref-6\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-7\">7</sup><p> <a href=\"https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators\">https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators</a>  <a href=\"#footnote-ref-7\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-8\">8</sup><p> <a href=\"http://www.who.int/health-accounts/ghed/en/\">http://www.who.int/health-accounts/ghed/en/</a>  <a href=\"#footnote-ref-8\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-9\">9</sup><p> <a href=\"https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators\">https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators</a>  <a href=\"#footnote-ref-9\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div><h1>Calendar</h1>\n<h2>Data collection:</h2>\n<p>Data collection follows a country&#x2019;s plan to conduct household consumption expenditure surveys, household budget surveys and household income and expenditure survey.</p><h2>Data release:</h2>\n<p>Estimates on the proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income was released on December 2017.

The concern is with all people and communities receiving the quality health services they need (including medicines and other health products), without financial hardship. Two indicators have been chosen to monitor target 3.8 within the SDG framework. Indicator 3.8.1 is for health service coverage, which is operationalized with an index that combines 16 health service coverage indicators for reproductive, maternal and child health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, and service capacity and access into a single summary metric. Indicator 3.8.2 focuses on health expenditures in relation to a household&#x2019;s budget to identify financial hardship caused by direct health care payments. Taken together, indicators 3.8.1 and 3.8.2 are meant to capture the service coverage and financial protection dimensions, respectively, of target 3.8. These two indicators should be always monitored jointly.</p>\n<p>Indicator 3.8.2 derives from methodologies dating back to the 1990s developed in collaboration with academics at the World Bank and the World Health Organization. Indicator 3.8.2 is about identifying people that need to devote a substantial share of their total household expenditure or income to health care. The focus is on payments made at the point of use to get any type of treatment, from any type of provider, for any type of disease or health problem, net of any reimbursements to the individual who made the payment but excluding pre-payments for health services; for example, in the form of taxes or specific insurance premiums or contributions. Such direct payments are the least equitable way to finance the health systems given that they determine the extent of care received. </p>\n<p>This is clearly against the spirit of the target, which calls for granting access based on health needs not a household&#x2019;s capacity to pull together all its financial resources to meet the health needs of its members. Some direct payments might be needed but indicator 3.8.2 is underpinned by the conviction that no one, at whatever income level, should have to choose between spending on health and spending on other basic goods and services such as education tuitions, food necessities, housing and utilities. One way of assessing the extent to which health systems lead to financial hardship is to calculate the proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health as a share of household total consumption or income. For detailed information on the definition chosen to monitor the financial protection dimension of universal health coverage within the SDG monitoring framework (indicator 3.8.2) please consult Wagstaff et al. (2018) and chapter 2 in the WHO and World Bank report on &#x201C;Tracking universal health coverage: 2017 global monitoring report&#x201D;.</p><h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n<p>It is feasible to monitor indicator 3.8.2 on a regular basis using the same household survey data that is used to monitor SDG target 1.1 and 1.2 on poverty<sup><a href=\"#footnote-10\" id=\"footnote-ref-10\">[10]</a></sup>. These surveys are also regularly conducted for other purposes such as calculating weights for the Consumer Price Index. These surveys are conducted typically by NSOs. Thus, monitoring the proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health as a share of total household consumption or income does not add any additional data collection burden so long as the health expenditure component of the household non-food consumption data can be identified. While this is an advantage, indicator 3.8.2 suffers from the same challenges of timeliness, frequency, data quality and comparability of surveys than SDG indicator 1.1.1. However, indicator 3.8.2 has its own conceptual and empirical limitations.</p>\n<p>First, indicator 3.8.2 attempts to identify financial hardship that individuals face when using their income, savings or taking loans to pay for health care. However, most household surveys fail to identify the source of funding used by a household who is reporting health expenditure. In countries where there is no retrospective reimbursement of household spending on health this is not a problem. If a household does report any expenditure on health, it would be because it is not going to be reimbursed by any third-party payer. It is therefore consistent with the definition given for direct health care payments (the numerator). </p>\n<p>For those countries on the other hand where there is retrospective reimbursement &#x2013; for example, via a contributory health insurance scheme - the amount reported by a household on health expenditures might be totally or partially reimbursed at some later point, perhaps outside the recall period of the household survey. </p>\n<p>Clearly, more work is needed to ensure that survey instruments gather information on the sources of funding used by the household to pay for health care, or the household survey instrument always specifies that health expenditures should be net of any reimbursement. </p>\n<p>Second, in the current definition of indicator 3.8.2 large health expenditures can be identified by comparing how much household spend on health to either household income or total household expenditure. Expenditure is the recommended measure of household&#x2019;s resources (see concept section) but recent empirical work has demonstrated that while statistics on 3.8.2 at country level are fairly robust to such choice, their disaggregation by income group is pretty sensitive to it. Income based measures show a greater concentration of the proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health among the poor than expenditure based measures (see chapter 2 in the WHO and World Bank 2017 report on tracking universal health coverage as well as Wagstaff et al 2018) .</p>\n<p>Third, indicator 3.8.2. relies on a single cut-off point to identify what constitutes &#x2018;large health expenditure as a share of total household expenditure or income&#x2019;. People just below such threshold are not taken into account, which is always the problem with measures based on cut-offs. This is simply avoided by plotting the cumulative distribution function of the health expenditure ratio behind 3.8.2. By doing so, it is possible to identify for any threshold the proportion of the population that is devoting any share of its household&#x2019;s budget to health. </p>\n<p>Fourth, indicator 3.8.2. is based on measures of ex-post spending on health care. Low levels of spending could be driven by measurement errors due to both non-sampling errors such as a very short recall period that does not allow the collection of information on health care requiring an overnight stay; or sampling errors such as over-sample of areas with a particularly low burden of disease. No spending could also be due to people not being able to spend anything on health which, at least for the services that are included in 3.8.1, should result in low levels of coverage. </p>\n<p>There are other indicators used to measure financial hardship. WHO uses a framework which includes , in addition to indicator 3.8.2, a definition of large health expenditure in relation to non-subsistence spending<sup><a href=\"#footnote-11\" id=\"footnote-ref-11\">[11]</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#footnote-12\" id=\"footnote-ref-12\">[12]</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#footnote-13\" id=\"footnote-ref-13\">[13]</a></sup>.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-10\">10</sup><p> <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf\">http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf</a>   <a href=\"#footnote-ref-10\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-11\">11</sup><p>Chapter 2 in &#x201C;Tracking universal health coverage: 2017 global monitoring report&#x201D;, World Health Organization and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/  The World Bank; 2017; <a href=\"http://www.who.int/healthinfo/indicators/2015/en/\">http://www.who.int/healthinfo/indicators/2015/en/</a> ;  <a href=\"#footnote-ref-11\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-12\">12</sup><p>Xu, K., Evans, D.

When there are multiple surveys over time for the same country a preference is given to estimates produced based on the same survey. A series of tests is performed to retain the best performing series (see collection process).</p><h2>Regional aggregates:</h2>\n<p>To construct regional and global level estimates, when survey-based estimates are not available for the reference years of 2000, 2005 or 2010 all survey-based estimates within a 5 year window of the reference year are &#x201C;lined-up&#x201D; by using a combination of interpolation, extrapolation, econometric modelling and imputation based on regional medians ( Wagstaff et al.,2018; chapter 2 of the 2017 WHO and World Bank report on tracking universal health care coverage).</p>\n<p>The World Bank and the World Health Organization use their own regional grouping, in addition to the regional breakdown proposed for the SDG by UNSD.</p><h2>Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level:</h2><h2>Quality assurance:</h2><h1>Data availability</h1>\n<p>This indicator relies primarily on the same data sources that are used to monitor SDG indicator 1.1.1 with the additional requirement of the availability of information regarding health expenditures. Taking this into account, the World Bank and WHO have identified 1566 potentially suitable household survey datasets from 155 countries. Some of these surveys were excluded because they were either inaccessible, lacked key variables required for the estimation of the proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health as a share of total household expenditure or income, they did not pass the quality assurance process or were not part of a consistent time series. As of December 2017 a total of 553 datapoints from 132 countries or territories spanning the period 1984-2015 have been used to produce SDG indicator 3.8.2. </p>\n<p>Data availability measured in terms of the number of countries that WHO and the World Bank have currently reviewed and retained for the estimation of the &#x201C;proportion of the population with large household expenditures on

It varies across countries but on average, this ranges from an annual 1 year basis to 3 to 5 years.</p>\n<h2>Disaggregation:</h2>\n<p>The following disaggregation is possible in so far as the survey has been designed to provide representative estimates at such level:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Gender and age of the head of the household</li>\n  <li>Geographic location (rural/urban)</li>\n  <li>Quintiles of the household welfare measures (total household expenditure or income). See comments and limitations for the sensitivity of the disaggregation to the choice of the welfare measure.</li>\n</ul><h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>\n<p>Country level estimates are all based on nationally representative surveys with information on both household total expenditure or income and household expenditure on health (see data sources). In most cases such data come from non-standard household surveys and ex-post standardization processes can be designed to increase the degree of comparability across countries. For instance, regional teams from the World Bank produce standardized versions of raw datasets following common regional procedures: the ECAPOV harmonized datasets are based on the Living Standards Measurement Study datasets &#x2013; LSMS<sup><a href=\"#footnote-14\" id=\"footnote-ref-14\">[14]</a></sup> or household budget surveys (HBS) collected in the World Bank&#x2019;s Europe and Central Asia region; the SHIP collection results from a poverty program on harmonized household surveys in the World Bank&#x2019;s African region, while the SHES collection was developed by the World Bank for the international comparison program<sup><a href=\"#footnote-15\" id=\"footnote-ref-15\">[15]</a></sup>. The Luxembourg income study (LIS) datasets results from effort to harmonize datasets from many high and middle-income countries<sup><a href=\"#footnote-16\" id=\"footnote-ref-16\">[16]</a></sup>. </p>\n<p>In some cases the raw data is accessible to produce country level estimates. In some countries in addition to the raw data a standardized version of it is available and in other countries only the standardized version is. When multiple versions of the same survey are available the best performing in terms of a series of quality assurance tests is retained (see collection process). When a standardized version of a nationally designed survey instruments is chosen there are differences between expenditure variables generated using the raw data, and the expenditure variables generated using the harmonization procedures which might result in different estimated incidence of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of household total expenditure or income.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-14\">14</sup><p>http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTLSMS/0,,contentMDK:21610833~pagePK:64168427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:3358997,00.html <a href=\"#footnote-ref-14\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-15\">15</sup><p> A detailed documentation describing the harmonization procedures is available from the accompanying pdf documents <a href=\"#footnote-ref-15\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-16\">16</sup><p> http://www.lisdatacenter.org/ <a href=\"#footnote-ref-16\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div><h1>References</h1>\n<h2>URL: </h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://apps.who.int/gho/cabinet/uhc.jsp\">http://apps.who.int/gho/cabinet/uhc.jsp</a>; <a href=\"http://datatopics.worldbank.org/universal-health-coverage/\">http://datatopics.worldbank.org/universal-health-coverage/</a> </p>\n<h2>References:</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Chapter 2 on Financial protection in &#x201C;Tracking universal health coverage: 2017 global monitoring report&#x201D;, World Health Organization and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/ The World Bank; 2017; </li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.who.int/healthinfo/universal_health_coverage/report/2017/en/\">http://www.who.int/healthinfo/universal_health_coverage/report/2017/en/</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/universalhealthcoverage/publication/tracking-universal-health-coverage-2017-global-monitoring-report\">http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/universalhealthcoverage/publication/tracking-universal-health-coverage-2017-global-monitoring-report</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.who.int/health_financing/topics/financial-protection/en/\">http://www.who.int/health_financing/topics/financial-protection/en/</a> </li>\n  <li>Wagstaff, A., Flores, G., Hsu J., Smitz, M-F., Chepynoga, K., Buisman, L.R., van Wilgenburg, K. and Eozenou, P., (2018), &#x201C;Progress on catastrophic health spending in 133 countries: a retrospective observational study&#x201D;, the Lancet Global Health, volume 6, issue 2, e169-e179. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(17)30429-1\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(17)30429-1</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>On underlying approaches behind the current definition of large health expenditures as a share of total household consumption or income:</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Chapter 18 of &#x201C;Analysing health equity using household survey data&#x201D;.

En fait, il s'agit de vérifier si le ratio dépenses de santé des ménages (numérateur) sur dépenses totales de consommation des ménages ou, lorsqu'elles ne sont pas disponibles, le revenu total des ménages (dénominateur) dépasse un certain seuil. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Numérateur</em></strong></p>\n<p>Les dépenses de santé des ménages sont définies comme toute dépense engagée au moment de l'utilisation d'un service pour obtenir tout type de soins (promotionnels, préventifs, curatifs, de réadaptation, palliatifs ou de longue durée), y compris tous les médicaments, vaccins et autres préparations pharmaceutiques ainsi que tous les produits de santé, <em>de tout type de prestataire et pour tous les membres du ménage</em>. Ces dépenses de santé se caractérisent par des paiements directs qui sont financés par les revenus (y compris les envois de fonds), l'épargne ou les prêts d'un ménage <strong>mais pour lesquels le ménage n'est pas remboursé par une tierce partie. </strong>Ainsi, elles ne donnent accès qu'aux services et aux produits de santé que les individus peuvent payer, sans aucune solidarité entre les bien-portants et les malades au-delà du ménage<sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-ref-1\">[1]</a></sup> et uniquement sur la base de la volonté et de la capacité de payer du ménage. Les paiements directs de soins de santé sont appelés paiements directs pour soins médicaux (PDSM) dans la classification des systèmes de financement des soins de santé (HF) de la Classification internationale pour les comptes nationaux de la santé (ICHA). Les PDSM constituent la source de financement la plus inéquitable d'un système de santé. </p>\n<p>Les composantes des dépenses de soins de santé d'un ménage ainsi définies doivent être cohérentes avec la section 06 portant sur la santé de la Classification des fonctions de consommation des ménages des ménages (COICOP) qui inclut les dépenses en médicaments et produits médicaux (06.1), les services de soins ambulatoires (06.2) et les services de soins hospitaliers (06.3) et qui est actuellement en processus de révision afin d'inclure davantage de catégories<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[2]</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Les informations complémentaires sur les définitions et les classifications (par exemple par prestataire, par caractéristiques des bénéficiaires) des dépenses de santé doivent être cohérentes avec la <a href=\"http ://www.who.int/health-accounts/methodology/en/\">ICHA</a> et sa famille de classifications. La ICHA est le résultat d'une collaboration entre l'OCDE, Eurostat et l'Organisation mondiale de la santé. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Dénominateur</em></strong></p>\n<p>Les dépenses de consommation et les revenus des ménages sont deux mesures de bien-être économique. La consommation des ménages est liée au revenu, une mesure de ressources économiques à long terme déterminant le niveau de vie d'un ménage. La consommation est généralement définie comme la somme des valeurs monétaires de tous les articles (biens et services) consommés par un ménage au cours d'une période de référence. Elle comprend les valeurs imputées des biens et services qui ne sont pas achetés mais acquis autrement pour être consommés. Les informations sur la consommation des ménages sont généralement collectées dans le cadre d'enquêtes auprès des ménages qui peuvent utiliser différentes approches pour mesurer la &#x2018;consommation&#x2019; selon que les articles soient des biens durables ou non durables et/ou soient directement produits par les ménages.</p>\n<p> La mesure la plus pertinente du revenu est le revenu disponible, car il est similaire au revenu maximum dont dispose un ménage pour ses dépenses de consommation pendant la période de référence. Le revenu disponible est défini comme le revenu total moins les impôts directs (nets de remboursements), les frais obligatoires et les amendes. Le revenu total est généralement composé des revenus d'emploi et de propriété,  de la production de services par le ménage pour sa propre consommation et des transferts reçus en espèces, en biens et en services<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[3]</a></sup>. </p>\n<p>Contrairement à la consommation, le revenu est plus difficile à mesurer avec précision en raison de sa plus grande variabilité dans le temps. Il est donc recommandé de privilégier l'utilisation des dépenses des ménages pour le calcul de cet indicateur (voir la section &#x201C;Commentaires et limites&#x201D; pour en savoir plus sur la sensibilité de cet indicateur au choix du dénominateur).

Les enquêtes sur les budgets des ménages et les enquêtes sur les revenus et les dépenses des ménages recueillent généralement ces informations car elles sont principalement menées pour fournir de l'information pour le calcul des indices des prix à la consommation ou la compilation des comptes nationaux. Les enquêtes socio-économiques et celles sur le niveau de vie constituent une autre source potentielle d'information pour cet indicateur. Toutefois, certaines de ces enquêtes peuvent ne pas recueillir d'informations sur les dépenses totales de consommation des ménages &#x2013; par exemple, lorsqu'un pays mesure la pauvreté en utilisant le revenu comme mesure du bien-être<sup><a href=\"#footnote-11\" id=\"footnote-ref-11\">[11]</a></sup>. Le critère le plus important pour le choix d'une source de données pour mesurer l'indicateur 3.8.2 est la disponibilité des dépenses de consommation des ménages en matière de santé et totales.</p>\n<p>Lorsque des enquêtes socio-économiques ou sur le niveau de vie sont utilisées pour mesurer l'indicateur 3.8.2, toutes les difficultés de comparabilité entre pays identifiées pour l'indicateur 1.1.1 s'appliquent également. Considérant l'accent mis sur les dépenses de santé des ménages, il est nécessaire d'améliorer les instruments d'enquête actuels afin d'assurer la comparabilité entre les pays et ce pour tous les types d'enquête auprès des ménages. L'OMS collabore avec différentes agences des Nations unies et d'autres parties prenantes importantes pour y parvenir<sup><a href=\"#footnote-12\" id=\"footnote-ref-12\">[12]</a></sup>.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup>11</sup><p><sup> </sup><a href=\"http://unstats. un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf\">http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf</a> <a href=\"#footnote-ref-11\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup>12</sup><p> Un exemple est l'engagement de l'OMS dans la révision en cours de la COICOP par la Division de statistique de l'ONU.\n<a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/class/revisions/coicop_revision.asp\">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/class/revisions/coicop_revision.asp</a> . Un autre exemple est un projet de la Fondation Bill-et-Melinda-Gates (FBMG) que l'OMS soutient pour améliorer la mesure des dépenses de santé des ménages.\n<a href=\"http://www.indepth-network.org/projects/ihope\">http://www.indepth-network.org/projects/ihope</a>\n<a href=\"#footnote-ref-12\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div><h2>Processus de collecte :</h2>\n<p>L'OMS obtient les données des enquêtes auprès des ménages des BNS, où le dénominateur et le numérateur du ratio sont calculés selon leurs propres procédures, soit directement par eux, soit par des consultants de l'OMS. L'OMS travaille par l'intermédiaire de ses bureaux régionaux ou nationaux pour obtenir l'accès aux données. Aucun ajustement systématique n'est effectué. </p>\n<p>La Banque mondiale reçoit généralement les données directement des BNS. Dans certains cas, elle utilise des données reçues indirectement. Par exemple, elle reçoit des données d'Eurostat et de l'Étude sur le revenu du Luxembourg (LIS), qui lui fournissent les données qu'ils ont reçues / harmonisées. L'Universidad Nacional de La Plata, l'Argentine et la Banque mondiale gèrent conjointement la base de données SEDLAC (Socio-Economic Database for Latin American and Caribbean), qui comprend des statistiques harmonisées sur la pauvreté et d'autres variables distributionnelles et sociales de 24 pays d'Amérique latine et des Caraïbes, basées sur des microdonnées provenant d'enquêtes auprès des ménages menées par les BNS. Les données sont obtenues dans le cadre de programmes spécifiques à chaque pays, notamment des programmes d'assistance technique et des activités conjointes d'analyse et de renforcement des capacités. La Banque mondiale entretient des relations avec les BNS sur des programmes de travail impliquant des systèmes statistiques et d'analyse de données. La Banque mondiale travaille généralement avec les BNS sur la mesure et l'analyse de la pauvreté dans le cadre des activités d'assistance technique. </p>\n<p>L'OMS et la Banque mondiale calculent l'indicateur 3.8.2 en suivant la même approche (voir la section Méthodologie). Les deux institutions combinent les estimations au niveau méso. L'éligibilité des estimations incluses dans la base de données mondiale commune pour la production d'estimations régionales et mondiales est basée sur les contrôles de qualité suivants :</p>\n<p><em>Pour le dénominateur</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comparer le logarithme de la consommation totale par habitant de la source de référence avec le logarithme de la consommation totale par habitant estimée à partir de l'enquête. Les deux sont exprimés sur une base mensuelle en dollars internationaux (PPA) de 2011. La source de référence est tirée de Povcalnet<sup><a href=\"#footnote-13\" id=\"footnote-ref-13\">[13]</a></sup> si disponible, ou sinon des Indicateurs du développement dans le monde (WDI)<sup><a href=\"#footnote-14\" id=\"footnote-ref-14\">[14]</a></sup>, et calculée comme les dépenses de consommation finale des ménages en PPA constants de 2011 divisés par la population totale. Lorsque la différence entre le logarithme de la consommation totale par habitant de la source de référence et celui de la valeur estimée à partir de l'enquête est supérieure à 10 % lorsque la comparaison est faite avec PovcalNet ou supérieure à 15 % lorsque la comparaison est faite avec les WDI, les données de l'enquête sont identifiées comme des valeurs aberrantes. </li>\n<li> Comparer le nombre de personnes vivant dans la pauvreté, estimé selon l'enquête en utilisant le seuil de pauvreté de 1,90 $ par jour en PPA de 2011, avec l'incidence de la pauvreté rapportée dans PovcalNet au même seuil de pauvreté (valeur de référence). Lorsque la différence absolue entre la valeur de référence et l'estimation de l'enquête dépasse 10 points de pourcentage, les données de l'enquête sont identifiées comme des valeurs aberrantes pour l'estimation de l'extrême pauvreté et signalées pour une éventuelle exclusion. </li>\n<li> Comparer le nombre de personnes vivant dans la pauvreté, estimé selon l'enquête en utilisant le seuil de pauvreté de 3,10 $ par jour en PPA de 2011, avec l'incidence de la pauvreté rapportée dans PovcalNet au même seuil de pauvreté (valeur de référence). Lorsque la différence absolue entre la valeur de référence et l'estimation de l'enquête dépasse 10 points de pourcentage, les données de l'enquête sont identifiées comme des valeurs aberrantes pour l'estimation de la pauvreté à 3,10 $ par jour et signalées pour une éventuelle exclusion. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Pour le numérateur</em></p>\n<ul>\n <li> Comparer le ratio moyen des dépenses de santé de l'enquête à une part budgétaire\nmoyenne de référence construite comme le ratio de la mesure agrégée des dépenses personnelles des ménages en monnaie locale courante et des dépenses de consommation finale agrégées des ménages en monnaie locale courante. Lorsque la différence absolue dépasse 5 points de pourcentage, les données de l'enquête sont identifiées comme des valeurs aberrantes pour l'estimation de part du budget des ménages consacrée à la santé et signalées pour une éventuelle exclusion. Le macro-indicateur des dépenses des ménages est disponible sur la <a href=\"http://www.who.int/health-accounts/ghed/en/\">Base de données des dépenses de santé globale</a> (GHED)<sup><a href=\"#footnote-15\" id=\"footnote-ref-15\">[15]</a></sup> et sur la <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators\">Base de données des indicateurs du développement dans le monde</a> (WDI)<sup><a href=\"#footnote-16\" id=\"footnote-ref-16\">[16]</a></sup>. Les informations sur les dépenses de consommation finale des ménages sont également extraites de la base de données WDI (code de la série : NE.CON.PRVT.CN).</li> </ul>\n<p>Ces points de référence sont également utilisés pour décider entre deux estimations pour les pays et les années pour lesquelles les deux institutions ont la même source de données. Pour plus d'informations, il est possible de consulter le Rapport mondial de suivi 2017 :  la couverture-santé universelle de l'OMS et de la Banque mondiale ainsi que le rapport 2018 de Wagstaff et al. </p>\n<p>À la fin du processus d'assurance qualité, l'OMS et la Banque mondiale rassemblent des estimations uniques pour cet indicateur, et ce pour chaque pays. L'OMS entreprend ensuite un processus de consultation des pays, en vertu de la résolution du Conseil exécutif de l'OMS (EB107.R8), avant de publier des estimations au niveau des pays au nom des États membres. Pour tous les indicateurs, ce processus commence par l'envoi aux ministères de la santé d'une demande officielle de l'OMS afin de désigner un point focal. Une fois que les États membres ont désigné les points focaux, l'OMS leur envoie des estimations provisoires et des descriptions méthodologiques. Le code STATA est également disponible pour reproduire les estimations. Les points focaux envoient ensuite à l'OMS leurs commentaires, qui comprennent souvent de nouvelles données ou des estimations nationales révisées qui sont utilisées pour mettre à jour les estimations nationales. Lors de la consultation des pays de 2017, 137 États membres de l'OMS ont désigné des points focaux, 100 d'entre eux ont reçu des estimations provisoires et des informations sur la méthodologie ; 37 n'ont reçu que des informations sur la méthodologie car aucune estimation provisoire n'a été produite. Des estimations sont disponibles pour 32 des 57 États membres de l'OMS sans point focal désigné.</p>\n<p>Outre cette consultation, l'OMS et la Banque mondiale organisent régulièrement des formations sur la mesure de l'absence de protection financière, auxquelles participent des représentants des ministères de la santé et des BNS. L'OMS a plusieurs collaborations régionales et nationales en cours pour soutenir la production de l'indicateur 3.8.2, car il a été récemment adopté. Il n'est toutefois pas encore produit de manière systématique par les BNS malgré la disponibilité des données et la simplicité de la méthodologie. Les résultats de ces collaborations ne sont pas encore inclus dans la base de données créée par l'OMS et la Banque mondiale, mais les estimations produites seront soumises au même processus d'assurance qualité décrit ci-dessus.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup>13</sup><p> <a href=\"http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/povOnDemand.aspx\">http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/povOnDemand.aspx</a>\n<a href=\"#footnote-ref-13\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup>14</sup><p> <a href=\"https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators\">https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators</a>\n<a href=\"#footnote-ref-14\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup>15</sup><p> <a href=\"http://www.who.int/health-accounts/ghed/en/\">http://www.who.int/health-accounts/ghed/en/</a>\n<a href=\"#footnote-ref-15\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup>16</sup><p> <a href=\"https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators\">https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators</a>\n<a href=\"#footnote-ref-16\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div><h1> Calendrier</h1>\n<h2> Collecte de données :</h2>\n<p>La collecte des données est liée aux plans des différents pays en matière d'enquête auprès des ménages portant sur les dépenses de consommation, les budgets ou les revenus et dépenses.</p><h2>Diffusion des données :</h2>\n<p>Les premiers estimés ont été diffusés en décembre 2017.

Voir la section Sources de données pour plus de détails. </p><h1>Compilateurs de données</h1>\n<p>L'OMS et la Banque mondiale.</p><h2>Justification :</h2>\n<p>La cible 3.8 est définie comme suit : &#x201C;Faire en sorte que chacun bénéficie d'une couverture sanitaire universelle, comprenant une protection contre les risques financiers et donnant accès à des services de santé essentiels de qualité et à des médicaments et vaccins essentiels sûrs, efficaces, de qualité et d'un coût abordable&#x201D;. L'objectif est que toutes les personnes et les communautés reçoivent les services de santé de qualité dont elles ont besoin (y compris les médicaments et autres produits de santé), sans difficultés financières. Deux indicateurs ont été choisis pour suivre la cible 3.8 dans le cadre des ODD. L'indicateur 3.8.1 s'intéresse à la couverture des services de santé et utilise un indice combinant 16 indicateurs de couverture des services de santé liés à la santé reproductive, maternelle et infantile, aux maladies infectieuses, aux maladies non transmissibles, et à la capacité et l'accès aux services en une seule mesure sommaire. L'indicateur 3.8.2 s'intéresse quant à lui aux dépenses de santé par rapport aux budgets des ménages pour identifier les difficultés financières causées par les paiements directs de soins de santé. Pris ensembles, les indicateurs 3.8.1 et 3.8.2 visent à saisir les dimensions de la couverture des services et de la protection financière de la cible 3.8. Ces deux indicateurs devraient toujours être suivis conjointement.</p>\n<p> L'indicateur 3.8.2 est issu de méthodologies remontant aux années 1990, élaborées en collaboration avec des chercheurs de la Banque mondiale et de l'OMS. Il vise à identifier les personnes qui doivent consacrer une part importante des dépenses ou revenus totaux de leur ménage aux soins de santé. L'accent est mis sur les paiements effectués directement par les ménages pour obtenir tout type de traitement, auprès de tout type de prestataire, pour tout type de maladie ou de problème de santé, déduction faite des remboursements, mais à l'exclusion des prépaiements pour les services de santé tels que les paiements sous la forme d'impôts ou de primes ou de cotisations d'assurance spécifiques. Les paiements directs effectués par les ménages sont le moyen le moins équitable de financer les systèmes de santé, car ils ont un impact direct sur l'étendue des soins reçus.</p>\n<p>Le tout va clairement à l'encontre de l'esprit de la cible, qui vise à aligner l'accès aux services en fonction des besoins et non de la capacité d'un ménage à rassembler toutes les ressources financières pour répondre aux besoins de santé de ses membres. Les paiements directs sont parfois nécessaires, mais l'indicateur 3.8.2 est sous-tendu par la conviction que personne, quel que soit son niveau de revenu, ne devrait avoir à choisir entre les dépenses de santé et les dépenses consacrées à d'autres biens et services de base tels que les frais de scolarité, les produits alimentaires de première nécessité, le logement et les services publics. Une façon d'évaluer dans quelle mesure les systèmes de santé entraînent des difficultés financières est de calculer la proportion des ménages ayant d'importantes dépenses de santé par rapport à leur consommation totale ou leur revenu total. Pour des informations détaillées sur la définition choisie pour suivre la dimension protection financière de la couverture-santé universelle dans le cadre du suivi des ODD (indicateur 3.8.2), il est possible de consulter Wagstaff et al. (2018) et le chapitre 2 du rapport de l'OMS et de la Banque mondiale &#x201C;Rapport mondial de suivi 2017 : la couverture-santé universelle&#x201D;.</p><h2>Commentaires et limites :</h2>\n<p>Il est possible de suivre l'indicateur 3.8.2 de manière régulière en utilisant les mêmes données d'enquête auprès des ménages que celles utilisées pour suivre les cibles 1.1 et 1.2, liées à la pauvreté<sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-ref-4\">[4]</a></sup>. Ces enquêtes sont généralement menées par les bureaux nationaux de statistique (BNS) et ce à d'autres fins, telles que le calcul des pondérations de l'indice des prix à la consommation. Ainsi, le suivi de la proportion de la population dont les dépenses de santé des ménages sont importantes par rapport à la consommation totale ou au revenu total de leur ménage n'ajoute pas de fardeau supplémentaire en matière de collecte de données, à condition que la composante \"dépenses de santé\" puisse être identifiée. Bien que cela constitue un avantage, l'indicateur 3.8.2 souffre des mêmes problèmes d'actualité, de fréquence, de qualité des données et de comparabilité que l'indicateur 1.1.1. Toutefois, l'indicateur 3.8.2 a également ses propres limites conceptuelles et empiriques.</p>\n<p>Premièrement, l'indicateur 3.8.2 tente d'identifier les difficultés financières auxquelles les individus sont confrontés lorsqu'ils utilisent leurs revenus, leurs économies ou contractent des prêts pour payer leurs soins de santé. Cependant, la plupart des enquêtes auprès des ménages ne parviennent pas à identifier la source de financement utilisée par les ménages. Dans les pays où il n'existe pas de remboursement rétroactif des dépenses de santé des ménages, cela ne pose pas de problème. Si un ménage déclare une dépense de santé, c'est parce qu'elle ne sera pas remboursée par une tierce partie. Le tout est donc conforme à la définition utilisée pour les paiements directs de soins de santé (le numérateur). </p>\n<p>Pour les pays  où il existe un remboursement rétroactif, par exemple via un régime d'assurance maladie contributif, le montant déclaré par un ménage pour les dépenses de santé peut être totalement ou partiellement remboursé à un moment ultérieur, parfois hors de la période de référence de l'enquête. </p>\n<p>Du travail supplémentaire sera nécessaire afin d'assurer que les instruments d'enquête recueillent des informations sur les sources de financement utilisées par le ménage pour payer les soins de santé, ou que les instruments d'enquête auprès des ménages précisent toujours que les dépenses de santé doivent être nettes de tout remboursement. </p>\n<p>Deuxièmement, selon la définition actuelle de l'indicateur 3.8.2, les dépenses de santé importantes peuvent être identifiées en fonction du revenu ou des dépenses totales des ménages. Il est généralement recommandé d'utiliser les dépenses pour mesurer les ressources des ménages (voir la section Concepts). Des travaux empiriques récents ont toutefois démontré que si les statistiques nationales pour l'indicateur 3.8.2 sont assez robustes lorsqu'on utilise les dépenses, on observe une certaine volatilité si l'on regarde le tout par groupe de revenu. Les mesures basées sur le revenu montrent une plus grande concentration de la proportion de la population ayant d'importantes dépenses de santé parmi les ménages plus pauvres que les mesures basées sur les dépenses (voir le chapitre 2 du Rapport mondial de suivi 2017 : la couverture-santé universelle de l'OMS et de la Banque mondiale ainsi que Wagstaff et al 2018).\n<p>Troisièmement, l'indicateur 3.8.2 s'appuie sur des seuils pour identifier ce qui constitue &#x2018;les dépenses de santé importantes en tant que part des dépenses ou revenus totaux des ménages&#x2019;. Les personnes se situant juste en dessous de ces seuils ne sont pas prises en compte, ce qui est toujours le problème avec les mesures basées sur des seuils. On peut éviter simplement ce problème en calculant la distribution cumulative du ratio des dépenses de santé en fonction des dépenses totales ou du revenu total du ménage. Ainsi, il serait même possible d'identifier pour n'importe quel seuil la proportion de la population consacrant une part quelconque du budget de son ménage à la santé. </p>\n<p>Quatrièmement, l'indicateur 3.8.2 est basé sur des mesures des dépenses de santé ex-post. De faibles niveaux de dépenses pourraient être attribuables à des erreurs de mesure dues à l'échantillonnage, telles qu'une période de référence trop courte qui ne permettrait pas la collecte d'informations sur les soins de santé nécessitant une nuitée, ou à des erreurs d'échantillonnage telles qu'un suréchantillonnage de régions où la morbidité est particulièrement faible. L'absence de dépenses pourrait également être due au fait que les gens ne peuvent rien dépenser pour la santé, ce qui, au moins pour les services qui sont inclus à l'indicateur 3.8.1, devrait se traduire par de faibles niveaux de couverture. </p>\n<p>Il existe d'autres indicateurs utilisés pour mesurer les difficultés financières. Par exemple, l'OMS utilise un cadre qui comprend, en plus de l'indicateur 3.8.2, une définition des grandes dépenses de santé par rapport aux dépenses de non-subsistance<sup><a href=\"#footnote-5\" id=\"footnote-ref-5\">[5]</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#footnote-6\" id=\"footnote-ref-6\">[6]</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#footnote-7\" id=\"footnote-ref-7\">[7]</a></sup>.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup>4</sup><p> <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf\">http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf</a>\n <a href=\"#footnote-ref-4\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup>5</sup><p>Chapitre 2\nde &#x201C;Rapport mondial de suivi 2017 : la couverture-santé universelle&#x201D;, Organisation mondiale de la santé et Banque internationale pour la reconstruction et le développement / Banque mondiale; 2017; <a href=\"https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/272598/9789242513554-fre.pdf?ua=1/</a> ; <a href=\"#footnote-ref-5\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup>6</sup><p>Xu, K., Evans, D.

Dans la plupart des cas, ces données proviennent d'enquêtes non standard auprès des ménages et des processus de normalisation ex-post peuvent être utilisés pour accroître le degré de comparabilité entre les pays. Par exemple, les équipes régionales de la Banque mondiale produisent des versions standardisées d'ensembles de données brutes en suivant des procédures régionales communes : les bases de données harmonisées de l'ECAPOV sont basées sur les bases de données de l'étude de mesure des niveaux de vie<sup><a href=\"#footnote-8\" id=\"footnote-ref-8\">[8]</a></sup> ou les enquêtes sur le budget des ménages (EBM) recueillies dans la région Europe et Asie centrale de la Banque mondiale ; la collection SHIP résulte d'un programme de lutte contre la pauvreté incluant des enquêtes harmonisées auprès des ménages dans la région Afrique de la Banque mondiale, tandis que la collection SHES a été développée par la Banque mondiale pour le programme de comparaison internationale<sup><a href=\"#footnote-9\" id=\"footnote-ref-9\">[9]</a></sup>. Les données de l'Étude sur le revenu du Luxembourg (LIS) sont le résultat d'un effort d'harmonisation des données de nombreux pays à revenus moyens et élevés<sup><a href=\"#footnote-10\" id=\"footnote-ref-10\">[10]</a></sup>. </p>\n<p>La disponibilité des données brutes et standardisées permettant de produire des estimés nationaux varie d'un pays à l'autre. Lorsque plusieurs versions des données d'une même enquête sont disponibles, celle répondant le mieux à une séries de tests d'assurance qualité est retenue (voir la section Processus de collecte). Lorsque les données provenant d'un instrument d'enquête conçu au niveau national sont sélectionnées, il existe généralement des différences entre les données brutes et les données harmonisées, ce qui peut entraîner des différences dans l'estimation de cet indicateur.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup>8</sup><p>http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTLSMS/0,,contentMDK:21610833~pagePK:64168427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:3358997,00.html <a href=\"#footnote-ref-8\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup>9</sup><p> Une documentation détaillée décrivant le processus d'harmonisation est disponible à partir des documents PDF connexes. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-9\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup>10</sup><p> http://www.lisdatacenter.org/ <a href=\"#footnote-ref-10\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div><h1>Références</h1>\n<h2>URL : </h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://apps.who.int/gho/cabinet/uhc.jsp\">http://apps.who.int/gho/cabinet/uhc.jsp</a> ; <a href=\"http://datatopics.worldbank.org/universal-health-coverage/\">http://datatopics.worldbank.org/universal-health-coverage</a> </p>\n<h2>Références :</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Chapitre 2 portant sur la protection financière du &#x201C;Rapport mondial de suivi 2017 : la couverture-santé universelle&#x201D;, Organisation mondiale de la santé et Banque internationale pour la reconstruction et le développement / Banque mondiale; 2017; </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/272598/9789242513554-fre.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y\">https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/272598/9789242513554-fre.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.who.int/health_financing/topics/financial-protection/en/\">http://www.who.int/health_financing/topics/financial-protection/en/</a> </li>\n<li>Wagstaff, A., Flores, G., Hsu J., Smitz, M-F., Chepynoga, K., Buisman, L.R., van Wilgenburg, K. et Eozenou, P., (2018), &#x201C;Progress on catastrophic health spending in 133 countries: a retrospective observational study&#x201D;, the Lancet Global Health, volume 6, issue 2, e169-e179. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(17)30429-1\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(17)30429-1</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Sur les approches sous-jacentes à la définition actuelle des grandes dépenses de santé en tant que part de la consommation ou du revenu total des ménages :</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chapitre 18 de &#x201C;Analysing health equity using household survey data&#x201D;.

Фактически он представляет собой коэффициент, величина которого превышает пороговое значение. Два основных понятия, входящие в это соотношение, - это расходы домохозяйств на здравоохранение (числитель) и общие расходы домохозяйств на потребление или, если эти данные отсутствуют, доход (знаменатель). </p>\n<p><strong><em>Числитель</em></strong></p>\n<p>Расходы домохозяйства на здравоохранение определяются как любые расходы, понесенные во время использования услуги, для получения любого вида ухода (стимулирующего, профилактического, лечебного, реабилитационного, паллиативного или долгосрочного ухода), включая все лекарства, вакцины и другие фармацевтические препараты, а также все товары медицинского назначения от любого поставщика и для всех членов семьи. Эти расходы на здравоохранение характеризуются прямыми платежами, которые совершаются за счет дохода домохозяйства (включая денежные переводы), сбережений или займов, но не включают возмещение, совершенное третьей стороной. Таким образом эти расходы предоставляют доступ к медицинским услугам и продуктам здравоохранения, за которые могут платить только люди как частные лица, без какого-либо взаимодействия между больными и здоровыми, находящимися вне домохозяйства, и исключительно на основе готовности и способности домохозяйства оплачивать эти расходы. Прямые платежи за услуги здравоохранения называются расходами, оплаченными из собственных средств (Out-Of-Pocket - OOP) в схемах классификации финансирования здравоохранения (HF) Международной классификации для счетов здравоохранения (МКСЗ). Платежи из собственных средств за услуги здравоохранения являются источником наибольшей несправедливости, связанной с системой оплаты услуг здравоохранения. </p>\n<p>Определенные таким образом компоненты расходов на здравоохранение в домашних хозяйствах должны соответствовать разделу 06 \"Здравоохранение\" Классификации индивидуального потребления ООН по целям (КИПЦ-COICOP), который в настоящее время включает расходы на медикаменты, лечебное оборудование и аппаратуру (06.1), амбулаторные услуги (06.2 ) и услуги больниц (06.3), но продолжает расширяться.</p>\n<p>Дополнительная информация об определениях и классификациях (например, по поставщикам, по характеристикам бенефициаров) расходов на здравоохранение должна соответствовать Международной классификации для счетов здравоохранения (МКСЗ) и ее семейству классификаций. МКСЗ является результатом сотрудничества между ОЭСР, Евростатом и Всемирной организацией здравоохранения. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Знаменатель</em></strong></p>\n<p>Расходы на потребление домохозяйства и доход домохозяйства являются мерами благосостояния, выраженными в денежной форме. Потребление домохозяйств - это функция постоянного дохода, который является мерой долгосрочных экономических ресурсов домохозяйства, определяющих уровень жизни. Потребление обычно определяется как сумма стоимостей всех элементов (товаров и услуг), потребленных домохозяйством на внутреннем рынке в течение отчетного периода. Потребление включает вмененную стоимость товаров и услуг, которые не были приобретены, но получены иным образом для целей потребления. Информация о потреблении домашних хозяйств обычно собирается при проведении обследований домашних хозяйств, в которых могут использоваться различные подходы для оценки потребления в зависимости от того, относятся ли позиции к товарам длительного или недлительного пользования и / или производятся ли они непосредственно домашними хозяйствами.</p>\n<p>Наиболее показательной оценкой дохода является располагаемый доход, поскольку он близок к максимальному ресурсу, которым располагает домашнее хозяйство для оплаты потребительских расходов в течение отчетного периода. Располагаемый доход определяется как общий доход за вычетом прямых налогов (исключая возвратные денежные средства), обязательных платежей и штрафов. Общий доход обычно состоит из дохода от работы по найму, дохода от собственности, дохода от производства услуг домохозяйствами для собственного потребления, трансфертов, полученных в денежной форме и в виде товаров, трансфертов, полученных в виде услуг. </p>\n<p>Доход более сложно оценить точно из-за его большей изменчивости с течением времени. Потребление менее изменчиво во времени и его легче оценить. Поэтому рекомендуется в случае наличия информации о потреблении и о доходах домашних хозяйств использовать информацию о потреблении (см. Раздел «Комментарии и ограничения», чтобы узнать больше о чувствительности показателя 3.8.2 к выбору информации о доходах / расходах для использования ее в знаменателе). Статистическая информация по показателю 3.8.2, который в настоящее время разрабатывается Всемирной организацией здравоохранения и Всемирным банком, преимущественно основывается на данных по потреблению (см. Раздел об источниках данных). </p>\n<p><strong><em>Пороговые значения</em></strong></p>\n<p>Рекомендуется использовать два пороговых значения для глобальной отчетности, чтобы определить большой удельный вес семейных расходов на медицинскую помощь в общем объеме расходов или доходов домохозяйств: нижний порог составляет 10% (3.8.2_10), а более высокий порог составляет 25% (3.8.2_25). Эти два пороговых значения показателя определяют наличие финансовых затруднений при оплате расходов на медицинскую помощь. </p>\n<p> ((см.

Обследования бюджетов домашних хозяйств (ОБДХ) и обследования доходов и расходов домашних хозяйств (ОДРДХ) обычно собирают такую информацию, поскольку они в основном проводятся с целью получения исходных данных для расчета индексов потребительских цен или составления национальных счетов. Другим потенциальным источником информации являются социально-экономические исследования или обследования уровня жизни; однако в рамках некоторых из этих обследований может не собираться информация об общих потребительских расходах домохозяйств, например, когда в стране уровень бедности оценивается с использованием дохода в качестве меры благосостояния. Наиболее важным критерием выбора источника данных для оценки показателя 3.8.2 ЦУР является наличие информации как о потребительских расходах домашних хозяйств на здравоохранение, так и общих потребительских расходах домашних хозяйств.</p>\n<p>Когда для оценки показателя 3.8.2 ЦУР используются данные социально-экономических исследований или обследования уровня жизни, то все проблемы обеспечения сопоставимости показателя 1.1.1 ЦУР по разным странам также становятся присущи процессам проведении мониторинга показателя 3.8.2 ЦУР. Для любого типа обследования домашних хозяйств, фокусирующего внимание на расходах домашних хозяйств на здравоохранение, необходимо совершенствовать существующие инструментарии обследования для обеспечения сопоставимости между странами. Всемирная организация здравоохранения сотрудничает с различными учреждениями ООН и другими важными заинтересованными сторонами для обеспечения того, чтобы запустить этот процесс. Одним из примеров является участие ВОЗ в постоянном пересмотре КИПЦ-COICOP, проводимом Статистическим отделом ООН. Другим примером является проект Фонда Билла и Мелинды Гейтс (BMGF), который ВОЗ поддерживает для совершенствования механизма оценки расходов домашних хозяйств на здравоохранение.</p><h2>Процесс сбора:</h2>\n<p>ВОЗ получает данные обследований домохозяйств от национальных статистических управлений, в которых знаменатель и числитель формулы для расчета доли расходов на здравоохранение составлены в соответствии с их собственными руководящими принципами, либо непосредственно ими, либо консультантами ВОЗ. ВОЗ работает через свои региональные бюро или страновые бюро для получения доступа к данным. Никаких систематических корректировок не проводится. </p>\n<p> Всемирный банк (ВБ) обычно получает данные от национальных статистических управлений (НСУ) напрямую. Но в некоторых случаях используются данные НСУ, получаемые косвенным путем. Например, Евростат и LIS (Люксембургское исследование доходов), получив от НСУ данные и гармонизовав их, затем предоставляют эти данные Всемирному банку. Национальный университет Ла-Платы, Аргентина и Всемирный банк совместно поддерживают базу данных SEDLAC (Социально-экономическая база данных для стран Латинской Америки и Карибского бассейна), которая включает в себя согласованные статистические данные по бедности и другие обобщенные и социальные переменные по 24 странам Латинской Америки и Карибского бассейна, основанные на микроданных, полученных при проведении обследований домашних хозяйств, организуемых национальными статистическими управлениями. Данные получаются посредством реализации конкретных страновых программ, включающих программы технической помощи и совместные аналитические мероприятия, а также мероприятий по наращиванию потенциала. Всемирный банк сотрудничает с национальными статистическими управлениями на основе рабочих программ, включающих статистические системы и анализ данных. Экономисты Всемирного банка, занимающиеся вопросами бедности, обычно взаимодействуют с экспертами национальных статистических управлений по широкому кругу вопросов оценки и анализа бедности в рамках деятельности по оказанию технической помощи. </p>\n<p>Всемирная организация здравоохранения и Всемирный банк разрабатывают показатель 3.8.2, следуя тому же принципу (см. Методологию). Обе организации объединяют оценки на мезоуровне. Правомочность оценок, включенных в общую глобальную базу данных для составления региональных и глобальных оценок, основана на следующих проверках качества: </p>\n<p><em>Применительно к знаменателю формулы для расчета доли расходов на здравоохранение</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Сравнивается логарифм общего потребления на душу населения в эталонном источнике\nс логарифмом общего потребления на душу населения, оцененным по результатам обследования. Оба показателя рассчитываются ежемесячно по ППС в международных долларах в ценах 2011 года. Эталонный источник берется из Povcalnet, если таковой имеется, и из Показателей мирового развития (ПМР), рассчитанных как расходы домохозяйств на конечное потребление в международных долларах в постоянных ценах 2011 года, поделенных на общую численность населения. Если разница между логарифмом общего потребления на душу населения в эталонном источнике и логарифмом величины, оцененной по результатам обследования как доля логарифма общего потребления на душу населения в эталонном источнике, превышает 10% при сравнении с данными из PovcalNet и более 15%, когда проводится сравнение с данными из ПМР, то значение в точке обследования отождествляется как выброс по отношению к международному уровню потребления на душу населения. </li>\n  <li>Сравнивается численность бедного населения, оцененная по результатам обследования\nна уровне черты бедности в 1,90 долл. США в день по ППС в ценах 2011 года, с распространенностью бедности, зарегистрированной в PovcalNet, на уровне той же черты бедности (эталонное значение). Если абсолютная разница между эталонным значением и оценкой обследования превышает 10 процентных пунктов, то значение в точке обследования идентифицируется как выброс в распространенности крайней нищеты и помечается для возможного исключения. </li>\n  <li>Сравнивается численность бедного населения, оцененная по результатам обследования\nна уровне черты бедности в 3,10 долл. США в день по ППС в ценах 2011 года, с распространенностью бедности, зарегистрированной в PovcalNet, на уровне той же черты бедности (эталонное значение).

Если абсолютная разница превышает 5 процентных пунктов, то значение в точке обследования идентифицируется как выброс с точки зрения доли бюджета домохозяйства, расходуемой на здравоохранение, и помечается для возможного исключения.

Информация о расходах домохозяйств на конечное потребление также взята из ПМР (код серии: NE.CON.PRVT.CN).</li> </ul>\n<p>Эти эталонные показатели также используются для выбора между двумя оценками для этих стран и теми годами, за которые обе организации имеют один и тот же источник данных.

Затем Всемирная организация здравоохранения проводит процесс страновых консультаций. В соответствии с резолюцией Исполнительного комитета ВОЗ (EB107.R8) Всемирной организации здравоохранения предлагается проводить процесс страновых консультаций с государствами-членами до публикации оценок. Для любого данного показателя этот процесс начинается с того, что ВОЗ направляет официальный запрос министерствам здравоохранения о назначении ими координатора для консультаций по данному показателю. После того, как государства-члены назначают координаторов, ВОЗ направляет им проекты смет и методологические описания. Коды STATA доступны для производства общих оценок. Затем координаторы направляют в ВОЗ свои комментарии, часто содержащие новые данные или пересмотренные страновые оценки, которые используются для обновления страновых оценок. В ходе страновых консультаций 2017 года 137 государств-членов ВОЗ назначили координаторов, 100 из них получили проекты смет и информацию о методологии; 37 получили только информацию о методологии, так как проект сметы не был подготовлен. Из 57 государств-членов ВОЗ без назначенных координаторов имеются оценки для 32 из этих стран.</p>\n<p>В дополнение к таким консультациям Всемирная организация здравоохранения и Всемирный банк регулярно проводят учебные мероприятия по оценке недостаточности охвата финансовой защитой, в которых принимают участие представители Министерства здравоохранения, а также Национального статистического управления. ВОЗ поддерживает несколько региональных и национальных программ сотрудничества в поддержку разработки показателя 3.8.2, но так как он был принят недавно, то Национальное статистическое управление пока не осуществляет его разработку на регулярной основе, несмотря на имеющиеся данные и простую методологию. Результаты такого сотрудничества еще не включены в базу данных, собранных ВОЗ и Всемирным банком, однако оценки, подготовленные страной, будут подвергаться такому же процессу обеспечения качества, о котором только что говорилось.</p><div class=\"сноски\"><div><sup>6</sup><p> <a href=\"http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/povOnDemand.aspx\">http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/povOnDemand.aspx</a> <a href=\"#footnote-ref-6\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup>7</sup><p> <a href=\"https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators\">https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-индикаторы</a> <a href=\"#footnote-ref-7\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup>8</sup><p> <a href=\"http://www.who.int/health-accounts/ghed/en/\">http://www.who.int/health- accounts/ghed/en/</a> <a href=\"#footnote-ref-8\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup>9</sup><p> <a href=\"https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators\">https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators</a> <a href=\"#footnote-ref-9\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div><h1>Календарь</h1>\n<h2>Сбор данных:</h2>\n<p>Сбор данных осуществляется в соответствии с графиком, разработанным в стране, по проведению обследований расходов домашних хозяйств, обследований бюджетов домашних хозяйств и обследований доходов и расходов домашних хозяйств.</p><h2>Выпуск данных:</h2>\n<p>Оценки доли населения с большим удельным весом семейных расходов на медицинскую помощь в общем объеме расходов или доходов домохозяйств были опубликованы в декабре 2017 года.

Задача заключается в том, чтобы гарантировать для всех людей и сообщества в целом получение качественных медицинских услуг, в которых они нуждаются (включая лекарства и другие медицинские товары), без возникновения финансовых затруднений. Для мониторинга задачи 3.8 в рамках ЦУР были выбраны два показателя. Показатель 3.8.1 предназначен для оценки охвата услугами здравоохранения, который ассоциируется с индексом, объединяющим 16 показателей оценки охвата услугами здравоохранения, включая репродуктивное здоровье, здоровье матерей и детей, заболеваемость инфекционными болезнями, заболеваемость неинфекционными болезнями, а также потенциал оказания медицинских услуг и доступ в единую сводную систему показателей. Показатель 3.8.2 фокусируется на расходах на здравоохранение во взаимосвязи с бюджетом домохозяйства для выявления финансовых затруднений, вызванных прямыми платежами за медицинское обслуживание. Взятые вместе, показатели 3.8.1 и 3.8.2 предназначены для выявления охвата услуг и аспектов финансовой защиты, соответствующих задаче 3.8. Эти два показателя должны всегда отслеживаться совместно.</p>\n<p>Показатель 3.8.2 основан на методологиях, разработанных в 1990-х годах в сотрудничестве с учеными Всемирного банка и Всемирной организации здравоохранения. Показатель 3.8.2 предназначен для определения населения, которому приходится тратить значительную долю общих расходов или доходов своих домохозяйств на здравоохранение. Основное внимание уделяется платежам, осуществляемым во время оказания услуги для получения врачебной помощи любого типа, от любого поставщика, для лечения любого типа заболевания или решения любой проблемы со здоровьем, за вычетом каких-либо возмещений лицу, которое произвело платеж, но исключая любой тип предоплаты за медицинские услуги; например, в виде налогов или специальных страховых премий или взносов. Прямые выплаты являются наименее справедливой схемой оплаты услуг системы здравоохранения, поскольку такие выплаты ограничивают пределы получаемой помощи. </p>\n<p>Это явно противоречит духу поставленной задачи, которая требует предоставления доступа к медицинским услугам, основываясь на потребностях в сохранении здоровья, а не в способности домохозяйства собирать все свои финансовые ресурсы для удовлетворения потребностей своих членов в получении медицинских услуг. Некоторые прямые платежи могут оказаться необходимыми, но показатель 3.8.2 основан на уверенности в том, что ни один человек с любым уровнем доходов не должно стоять перед выбором между расходами на здравоохранение и расходами на другие основные товары и услуги, такие как расходы на обучение, покупку продовольствия, оплату жилья и коммунальных услуг. Один из способов оценки пределов, вне которых системы здравоохранения приводят к финансовым затруднениям, состоит в том, чтобы определить долю населения с большим удельным весом семейных расходов на медицинскую помощь в общем объеме расходов или доходов домохозяйств. Для получения подробной информации об определении, выбранном для мониторинга аспекта финансовой защиты всеобщего охвата медико-санитарными услугами в рамках системы мониторинга ЦУР (показатель 3.8.2), см. Wagstaff et al. (2018) и главу 2 доклада ВОЗ и Всемирного банка \"Отслеживание всеобщего охвата услугами здравоохранения: доклад о глобальном мониторинге за 2017 год\".</p><h2>Комментарии и ограничения:</h2>\n<p>Можно проводить мониторинг показателя 3.8.2 на регулярной основе, используя те же данные обследования домохозяйств, которые используются для мониторинга задач 1.1 и 1.2 ЦУР по бедности.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-10\" id=\"footnote-ref-10\" >[10]</a></sup>.Эти обследования также регулярно проводятся для других целей, таких как расчет весов для индекса потребительских цен. Эти обследования обычно проводятся национальными статистическими управлениями. Таким образом, мониторинг доли населения с большим удельным весом семейных расходов на медицинскую помощь в общем объеме расходов или доходов домохозяйств не добавляет дополнительного бремени, связанного со сбором данных, при условии, что можно выделить компонент расходов на здравоохранение в данных по непродовольственным потребительским расходам домохозяйства. Хотя данный подход обладает несомненными преимуществами, показатель 3.8.2 страдает от тех же проблем своевременности, частоты проведения обследований, качества и сопоставимости данных обследований, что и показатель ЦУР 1.1.1. При этом показатель 3.8.2 имеет свои концептуальные и эмпирические ограничения.</p>\n<p>Во-первых, с помощью показателя 3.8.2 делаются попытки определить финансовые трудности, с которыми сталкиваются люди при использовании средств своего дохода, сбережений или в связи с необходимостью получения кредитов для оплаты медицинских услуг. Однако большинство обследований домохозяйств не позволяют определить источник финансирования, используемый домохозяйством, отчитывающимся о расходах на здравоохранение. В странах, где нет ретроспективной компенсации затрат домохозяйств на здравоохранение, это не является проблемой. Если домохозяйство отчитывается о каких-либо расходах на здравоохранение, это будет означать, что эти расходы не будут возмещены какой-либо третьей стороной. Следовательно, такое положение соответствует определению, данному для прямых платежей на здравоохранение (числитель). </p>\n<p>С другой стороны, для тех стран, где существует ретроспективная компенсация затрат, например, через систему обязательного медицинского страхования - сумма, включаемая домохозяйством в отчет о расходах на здравоохранение, может быть полностью или частично возмещена на более позднем этапе, возможно, за пределами периода сбора отчетов от домохозяйств в рамках проведения обследования. </p>\n<p> Очевидно, что требуется провести дополнительную работу для обеспечения того, чтобы инструментарий обследования обеспечивал сбор информации об источниках финансирования, используемых домохозяйством для оплаты медицинских услуг, или в инструментарии обследования домохозяйств всегда должно присутствовать указание на то, что расходы на здравоохранение должны учитываться за вычетом какой-либо компенсации. </p>\n<p>Во-вторых, в текущем определении показателя 3.8.2 большой удельный вес расходов на здравоохранение можно определить, сравнивая расходы домохозяйства на здравоохранение с доходом домохозяйства или с общими расходами домохозяйства. Расходы - это рекомендуемая мера ресурсов домохозяйств (см. Концептуальный раздел), но в одной из недавних эмпирических работ было показано, что, хотя статистические данные по показателю 3.8.2 на страновом уровне довольно малочувствительны к такому выбору, их разбивка по группам доходов довольно чувствительна к нему. Оценки, основанные на доходах, показывают более высокую концентрацию доли населения с большим удельным весом расходов домохозяйств на здравоохранение среди бедных, чем оценки, основанные на расходах (см. Главу 2 в отчете ВОЗ и Всемирного банка за 2017 год \"Отслеживание всеобщего охвата услугами здравоохранения: доклад о глобальном мониторинге за 2017 год\", а также Wagstaff et al 2018 ) </p>\n<p>В-третьих, показатель 3.8.2. опирается на одну общую точку отсечения для определения того, что представляет собой большой удельный вес семейных расходов на медицинскую помощь в общем объеме расходов или доходов домохозяйств. Люди, находящиеся чуть ниже такого порога, не принимаются во внимание, что всегда является проблемой с оценками, основанными на отсечениях. Этого просто избежать, построив график кумулятивной функции распределения соотношения расходов на здравоохранение, присущих показателю 3.8.2. Таким образом, для любого порога можно определить долю населения, выделяющего некую часть бюджета своего домохозяйства на здравоохранение. </p>\n<p>В-четвертых, показатель 3.8.2. основан на оценке фактических расходов на здравоохранение. Низкие уровни понесенных расходов могут быть обусловлены ошибками измерений, такими как ошибки, не зависящие от выборочного наблюдения, например, очень короткий период сбора отчетности, который не позволяет получить информацию о медицинской помощи, требующей госпитализации на какое-то время, или ошибок, зависящих от выборки, таких как чрезмерная выборка районов с особенно низким уровнем заболеваемости. Отсутствие расходов также может быть вызвано тем, что люди не могут ничего потратить на здравоохранение, что, по крайней мере для услуг, включенных в показатель 3.8.1, должно привести к низким уровням охвата. </p>\n<p>Есть и другие показатели, используемые для оценки финансовых трудностей. ВОЗ использует структуру, которая включает, в дополнение к показателю 3.8.2, определение крупных расходов на здравоохранение по сравнению с расходами, не связанными с оплатой питания и проживания.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-11\" id=\"footnote-ref-11\">[11]</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#footnote-12\" id=\"footnote-ref-12\">[12]</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#footnote-13\" id=\"footnote-ref-13\">[13]</a></sup>.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup>10</sup><p> <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf\">http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf</a>   <a href=\"#footnote-ref-10\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup>11</sup><p>Chapter 2 in &#x201C;Tracking universal health coverage: 2017 global monitoring report&#x201D;, World Health Organization and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/  The World Bank; 2017; <a href=\"http://www.who.int/healthinfo/indicators/2015/en/\">http://www.who.int/healthinfo/indicators/2015/en/</a> ;  <a href=\"#footnote-ref-11\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup>12</sup><p>Xu, K., Evans, D.

Принимая во внимание это условие, Всемирный банк и ВОЗ выявили 1566 потенциально подходящих наборов данных обследования домашних хозяйств из 155 стран. В дальнейшем некоторые из них были исключены, поскольку данные тех обследований либо были недоступны, или отсутствовали ключевые переменные, необходимые для оценки доли населения с большим удельным весом семейных расходов на медицинскую помощь в общем объеме расходов или доходов домохозяйств, или они не прошли процесс обеспечения надлежащего качества или не были частью последовательных временных рядов.

Источники данных). В большинстве случаев такие данные поступают из нестандартизированных обследований домашних хозяйств, а процессы последующей стандартизации могут быть разработаны для повышения степени сопоставимости между странами. Например, группы Всемирного банка, ответственные за региональные показатели, создают стандартизированные версии наборов первичных данных на основе общих региональных процедур: гармонизированные наборы данных ECAPOV основаны на наборах данных исследования по измерению уровня жизни (LSMS) <sup><a href=\"#footnote-14\" id=\"footnote-ref-14\">[14]</a></sup> или обследования бюджетов домашних хозяйств (ОБДХ), собранных в регионе Европы и Центральной Азии, который курирует Всемирный банк; набор данных SHIP является результатом реализации программы борьбы с бедностью в рамках согласованных обследований домашних хозяйств в африканском регионе, который курирует Всемирный банк, в то время как процедура сбора данных SHES была разработана Всемирным банком для международной программы сопоставлений. <sup><a href=\"#footnote-15\" id=\"footnote-ref-15\">[15]</a></sup></sup>Наборы данных Люксембургского исследования доходов (LIS) являются результатом усилий по гармонизации наборов данных из многих стран с высоким и средним уровнем дохода. <sup><a href=\"#footnote-16\" id=\"footnote-ref-16\">[16]</a></sup></p>\n<p>В некоторых случаях первичные данные доступны для получения оценок на страновом уровне. В некоторых странах в дополнение к первичным данным имеется стандартизированная версия первичных данных, а в других странах имеется только стандартизированная версия. Когда доступны комплексные версии одного и того же обследования, сохраняется наилучшая из реализованных версий с точки зрения проведенной серии проверок на обеспечение качества (см. Процесс сбора). При выборе стандартизированной версии инструментариев обследования, разработанных на национальном уровне, существуют различия между переменными расходов, произведенных с использованием первичных данных, и переменными расходов, произведенных с использованием процедур гармонизации, которые могут привести к различиям в оценке доли населения с большим удельным весом семейных расходов на медицинскую помощь в общем объеме расходов или доходов домохозяйств.\n</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup>14</sup><p>http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTLSMS/0,,contentMDK:21610833~pagePK:64168427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:3358997,00.html\n\n<a href=\"#footnote-ref-14\">&#x2191;</a></p></div>\n<div><sup>15</sup><p> Подробная документация, описывающая процедуры гармонизации, доступна в сопроводительных документах в формате pdf <a href=\"#footnote-ref-15\">&#x2191;</a></p></div>\n<div><sup>16</sup><p> http://www.lisdatacenter.org/ <a href=\"#footnote-ref-16\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><h1>Ссылки</h1>\n<h2>URL: </h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://apps.who.int/gho/cabinet/uhc.jsp\">http://apps.who.int/gho/cabinet/uhc.jsp</a>; <a href=\"http://datatopics.worldbank.org/universal-health-coverage/\">http://datatopics.worldbank.org/universal-health-coverage/</a> </p>\n<h2>Ссылки:</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Chapter 2 on Financial protection in &#x201C;Tracking universal health coverage:\n2017 global monitoring report&#x201D;, World Health Organization and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/ The World Bank; 2017; </li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.who.int/healthinfo/universal_health_coverage/report/2017/en/\">http://www.who.int/healthinfo/universal_health_coverage/report/2017/en/</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/universalhealthcoverage/publication/tracking-universal-health-coverage-2017-global-monitoring-report\">http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/universalhealthcoverage/publication/tracking-universal-health-coverage-2017-global-monitoring-report</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.who.int/health_financing/topics/financial-protection/en/\">http://www.who.int/health_financing/topics/financial-protection/en/</a>\n</li>\n  <li>Wagstaff, A., Flores, G., Hsu J., Smitz, M-F., Chepynoga, K., Buisman, L.R.,\nvan Wilgenburg, K. and Eozenou, P., (2018), &#x201C;Progress on catastrophic health spending in 133 countries: a retrospective observational study&#x201D;, the Lancet Global Health, volume 6, issue 2, e169-e179. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(17)30429-1\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(17)30429-1</a></li> </ul>\n<p><em>On underlying approaches behind the current definition of large health expenditures as a share of total household consumption or income:</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Chapter 18 of &#x201C;Analysing health equity using household survey data&#x201D;.\nWashington, DC: World Bank Group; 2008, <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/health/publication/analyzing-health-equity-using-household-survey-data\">http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/health/publication/analyzing-health-equity-using-household-survey-data</a> </li> </ul>\n<p><em>Для определения расходов на здравоохранение: </em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/a-system-of-health-accounts/classification-of-health-care-financing-schemes-icha-hf_9789264116016-9-en\">http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/a-system-of-health-accounts/classification-of-health-care-financing-schemes-icha-hf_9789264116016-9-en</a>\n</li> </ul>\n<p><em>Для компонентов расходов на здравоохранение:</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Раздел 06 Классификации ООН индивидуального потребления по целям (КИПЦ-COICOP)\n<a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/class/revisions/coicop_revision.asp\">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/class/revisions/coicop_revision.asp</a>; <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcs.asp?Cl=5&amp;Lg=1&amp;Co=06.1\">http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcs.asp?Cl=5&amp;Lg=1&amp;Co=06.1</a> </li>. </ul>"}}
