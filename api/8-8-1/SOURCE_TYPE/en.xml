	<message>The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 8-8-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The recommended data sources are different types of administrative records, such as records of national systems for the notification of occupational injuries (labour inspection records and annual reports; insurance and compensation records, death registers), supplemented by household surveys (especially in order to cover informal sector enterprises and the self-employed) and/or establishment surveys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metadata should clearly specify (i) whether the statistics relate to cases of occupational injury which have been reported (to an accident notification system or to an accident compensation scheme), compensated (by an accident insurance scheme) or identified in some other way (for example through a survey of households or establishments) and (ii) whether cases of occupational disease and cases of injury due to commuting accidents are excluded from the statistics, as recommended. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
