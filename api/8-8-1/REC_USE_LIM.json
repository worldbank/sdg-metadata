Underreporting is thought to be present in countries at all levels of development but may be particularly problematic in some developing countries. Data users should be aware of this issue when analysing the data. Double counting of cases of occupational injury may also happen in cases where data from several registries (records kept by different agencies, for example) are consolidated to have more comprehensive statistics. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Because data quality issues may be present, it may be more relevant to analyse indicator trends rather than levels. When measured over a period of time, the data can reveal progress or deterioration in occupational safety and health, and thus point to the effectiveness of prevention measures. This indicator is volatile and strong annual fluctuations may occur due to unexpected but significant accidents or national calamities. The underlying trend should therefore be analysed. </p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
