	<message>The COVERAGE field for indicator 8-8-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;Data availability: Data for this indicator is available for 87 countries and territories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time series: The submission covers data from 2000 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disaggregation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator should be disaggregated by both sex and migrant status. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherever possible, it would also be useful to have information disaggregated by economic activity and occupation. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
