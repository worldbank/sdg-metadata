Data derived from administrative records are not strictly comparable since they include numerous types of records that follow different rules and are maintained by different agencies. Two main sources of data are records of notifications by employers to the competent authority and insurance records of the authority compensating the victims. These two would clearly yield different results, since it is possible that not all injuries that were compensated to workers were reported by the employer and vice versa. It is also possible that these records have a different geographical coverage or that they cover different economic activities.</p>\n<p>When statistics come from an establishment survey, the results would be closer to those from records of notifications made by employers since it is also the employer who provides the establishment survey information. However, establishment surveys tend not to cover the informal sector, establishments of a very small size and sometimes the agricultural sector. </p>\n<p>When statistics come from a household survey, their reliability depends heavily on the accuracy of the respondents, who may be subjective in the information given.</p>\n<p> </p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
