	<data>&lt;p&gt;Most data on time use are collected through dedicated time use surveys or from time-use modules integrated into multi-purpose household surveys, conducted at the national level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or a stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed and the time that activity began and ended (in most of the cases based on fixed intervals), and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or a week.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
