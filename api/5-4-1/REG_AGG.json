Furthermore, limited comparability across national data hampers the computation of regional aggregates. Nevertheless, UNSD regularly produces regional estimates to monitor and report on global trends. This is done by using the latest available data from each country in the region. In the case of insufficient data from a region, regional aggregates are not reported for the particular region. The SDG regions of &#x201C;Australia and New Zealand&#x201D; and &#x201C;Europe and North America&#x201D; are combined to produce a single aggregate for &#x201C;Developed region.&#x201D; In addition, the ratio of time spent by women women:men is computed separately for each country and then averaged over the countries in the region to ensure comparability. </p>","es":"","fr":"Agrégats régionaux :\nLe nombre de pays menant de telles enquêtes est insuffisant pour permettre le calcul des agrégats régionaux.
