	<message>The STAT_CONC_DEF field for indicator 3-d-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;The revised International Health Regulations (IHR) were adopted in 2005 and entered into force in 2007. Under the IHR, States Parties are obliged to develop and maintain minimum core capacities for surveillance and response, including at points of entry, to detect, assess, notify, and respond to any potential public health events of international concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article 54 of the IHR states, &amp;quot;States Parties and the Director-General shall report to the Health Assembly on the implementation of these Regulations as decided by the Health Assembly.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State Party self-assessment and reporting tool captures the level of self-assessed national capacities. They are essential public health capacities that States Parties are required to put in place throughout their territories according to Articles 5 and 12 and Annex 1A of the IHR (2005) requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO published the revised second edition of the IHR State Parties Self-Assessment Tool in 2021 with new indicators related to gender equality in health emergencies, advocacy for IHR implementation, and community engagement, to name a few. The revisions are intended to improve the assessment of the IHR core capacities and the preparedness of State parties for health emergencies. The indicator SDG 3.d.1 reflects the capacities State Parties of the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) had agreed and committed to developing.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
