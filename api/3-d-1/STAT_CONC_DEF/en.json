They are essential public health capacities that States Parties are required to put in place throughout their territories according to Articles 5 and 12 and Annex 1A of the IHR (2005) requirements. </p>\n<p>Based on the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO published the revised second edition of the IHR State Parties Self-Assessment Tool in 2021 with new indicators related to gender equality in health emergencies, advocacy for IHR implementation, and community engagement, to name a few. The revisions are intended to improve the assessment of the IHR core capacities and the preparedness of State parties for health emergencies. The indicator SDG 3.d.1 reflects the capacities State Parties of the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) had agreed and committed to developing.</p>"}
