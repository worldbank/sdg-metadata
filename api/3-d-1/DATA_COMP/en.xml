	<message>The DATA_COMP field for indicator 3-d-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;All data are from the questionnaires submitted by States Parties annually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each of the 15 capacities, one to five indicators are used to measure implementation status. For each indicator, the reporting State Party is asked to select which of the five levels best describes the State Party&amp;apos;s current status. To move to the next level, all capacities described in previous levels should be in place for each indicator. The score of each indicator level is classified as a percentage of performance along the &amp;quot;1 to 5&amp;quot; scale. e.g. for a country selecting level 3 for indicator 2.1, the indicator level is expressed as: 3/5*100=60%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAPACITY LEVEL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level of capacity is expressed as the average of all indicators. e.g. for a country selecting level 3 for indicator 2.1 and level 4 for indicator 2.2. The indicator level for 2.1 is expressed as 3/5*100=60%, the indicator level for 2.2 will be expressed as 4/5*100=80% and the capacity level for 2 will be expressed as (60+80)/2=70%&lt;/p&gt;</data>
