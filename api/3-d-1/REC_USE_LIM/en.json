For the period 2010 to 2017, the questionnaire, known as the IHR monitoring questionnaire, is divided into thirteen sections, one for each of the eight core capacities, PoE and four hazards and information on the status of implementation for each capacity. The IHR monitoring questionnaire ( 2010 to 2017) was replaced by the IHR State Parties Self-Assessment Tool &#x2013; SPAR, published in July 2018 also known as SPAR 1st edition. The States Parties used the questionnaire from the 2018 &#x2013; 2020 SPAR reporting cycle. The current questionnaire replaced the SPAR 1st edition and was used by the Member States for 2021. Under each capacity, the indicators were either retained, replaced or added. Historical trends based on the data for similar capacity titles may be taken with caution. </p>"}
