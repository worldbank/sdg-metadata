	<data>&lt;p&gt;The e-SPAR electronic platform has mechanisms and checks to monitor reports received and to proceed with quality checks. The eSPAR is also accessible to WHO staff working with the Member States on SPAR (all levels). When the national authority fills in the questionnaire, electronic checks are automatically available (pop-up alerts) to avoid potential mistakes and missing critical information on the report before final submission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seminars are promoted, tutorials are available (under revision) and consultation with national authorities can be made in coordination with all levels of WHO. More details with references, short videos and links in several languages at: &lt;a href=&quot;https://extranet.who.int/e-spar/&quot;&gt;https://extranet.who.int/e-spar/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</data>
