The indicator can be calculated both from administrative data and from household surveys. If the former, the number of enrolments in organized learning programmes are reported by schools and the population in the age group one year below the official primary entry age is derived from population estimates. For the calculation of this indicator at the global level, population estimates from the UN Population Division are used. If derived from household surveys, both enrolments and population are collected at the same time.</p>\n<p>PROL<sub>0t1,AG(a-1)</sub> = E<sub>0t1,AG(a-1)</sub>/SAP<sub>AG(a-1)</sub></p>\n<p>where:</p>\n<p>PROL<sub>0t1,AG(a-1)</sub> = participation rate in organized learning one year before the official entry age a to primary education</p>\n<p>E<sub>0t1,AG(a-1)</sub> = enrolment in early childhood or primary education (ISCED levels 0 and 1) aged one year below the official entry age a to primary education</p>\n<p>SAP<sub>AG(a-1)</sub> = school-age population aged one year below the official entry age a to primary education</p>"}
