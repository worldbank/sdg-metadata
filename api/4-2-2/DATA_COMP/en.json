{"status":"success","message":"The DATA_COMP field for indicator 4-2-2, translated into en","data":"<p>The number of children in the relevant age group who participate in an organized learning programme is expressed as a percentage of the total population in the same age range. The indicator can be calculated both from administrative data and from household surveys. If the former, the number of enrolments in organized learning programmes are reported by schools and the population in the age group one year below the official primary entry age is derived from population estimates. For the calculation of this indicator at the global level, population estimates from the UN Population Division are used. If derived from household surveys, both enrolments and population are collected at the same time.</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msub>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>P</mi>\n        <mi>R</mi>\n        <mi>O</mi>\n        <mi>L</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mn>0</mn>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mn>1</mn>\n        <mo>,</mo>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>A</mi>\n        <mi>G</mi>\n        <mfenced separators=\"|\">\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>a</mi>\n            <mo>-</mo>\n            <mn>1</mn>\n          </mrow>\n        </mfenced>\n        <mo>=</mo>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msub>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <msub>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>E</mi>\n          </mrow>\n          <mrow>\n            <mn>0</mn>\n            <mi>t</mi>\n            <mn>1</mn>\n            <mo>,</mo>\n            <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n            <mi>A</mi>\n            <mi>G</mi>\n            <mo>(</mo>\n            <mi>a</mi>\n            <mo>-</mo>\n            <mn>1</mn>\n            <mo>)</mo>\n          </mrow>\n        </msub>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <msub>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>S</mi>\n            <mi>A</mi>\n            <mi>P</mi>\n          </mrow>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>A</mi>\n            <mi>G</mi>\n            <mo>(</mo>\n            <mi>a</mi>\n            <mo>-</mo>\n            <mn>1</mn>\n            <mo>)</mo>\n          </mrow>\n        </msub>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n  </math></p>\n<p>where:</p>\n<p><em>PROL<sub>0t1,AG(a-1)</sub></em> = participation rate in organized learning one year before the official entry age <em>a</em> to primary education</p>\n<p><em>E<sub>0t1,AG(a-1)</sub></em> = enrolment in early childhood or primary education (ISCED levels 0 and 1) aged one year below the official entry age <em>a</em> to primary education</p>\n<p><em>SAP<sub>AG(a-1)</sub></em> = school-age population aged one year below the official entry age <em>a</em> to primary education</p>"}
