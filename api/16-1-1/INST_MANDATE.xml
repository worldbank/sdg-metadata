The Economic and Social Council, in its resolution 1984/48 of 25 May 1984, requested that the Secretary-General maintain and develop the United Nations crime-related database by continuing to conduct surveys of crime trends and the operations of criminal justice systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Article 64 of its constitution, WHO is mandated to request each Member State to provide statistics on mortality. In support of this, the first World Health Assembly endorsed the sixth revision of the International List of Causes of Death, now called the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of death (ICD). The &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/89478/WHA20.18_eng.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WHO Nomenclature Regulations&lt;/a&gt; of 1967 affirms the importance of compiling and publishing statistics of mortality and morbidity in comparable form. Member States are obliged to provide WHO with the statistics in accordance with the Regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
