	<data>&lt;p&gt;At international level, data on intentional homicides are routinely collected by UNODC through the annual UN Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (UN-CTS) data collection. As requested by the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, over 140 Member States have already appointed a UN-CTS national focal point that delivers UN-CTS data to UNODC. In most cases these focal points are national institutions responsible for data production in the area of crime and criminal justice (National Statistical Offices, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Justice, etc.). For countries that have not appointed a focal point, the request for data is sent to permanent missions in Vienna. When a country does not report to UNODC, other official sources such as authoritative websites, publications, or other forms of communication are used. Homicide estimates from WHO are used when no other source on homicide is available. Once consolidated, data are shared to countries to check their accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When data and related metadata are available, some adjustments are made to data in order to assure compliance with the definition of intentional homicide as provided by the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS). National data on types of killings that are considered as intentional homicide by the ICCS, while being classified under a different crime at country level, are added to national figures of intentional homicide. This can be done only when detailed data on such types of killings (e.g. serious assault leading to death, honor killing, etc.) are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for UNODC data dissemination policy, data for SDG monitoring are sent to countries for consultation prior to publication. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
