Based on a set of standard quality dimensions for statistical data, a quality assessment framework was developed to evaluate global homicide data based on five main criteria:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Comparability</li>\n  <li>Completeness</li>\n  <li>Timeliness</li>\n  <li>Internal Consistency</li>\n  <li>External Consistency</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For each of these criteria quality indicators are defined and a qualitative score is computed per country (on a scale of 0-100), which is then converted to a qualitative score in three categories (good; fair; low). A total score encompasses all five criteria.</p>\n<p>More information on the quality assessment score can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/gsh/Meth_Annex_GHS.pdf\">methodological annex</a> of the 2019 Global Study on Homicide. The next update data quality assessment will be presented in the 2023 Global Study on Homicide.</p>","es":"","fr":"","pt":"","ru":""}}
