	<message>The STAT_CONC_DEF field for indicator 16-1-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator is defined as the total count of victims of intentional homicide divided by the total population, expressed per 100,000 population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intentional homicide is defined as the unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent to cause death or serious injury (Source: International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes, ICCS 2015); population refers to total resident population in a given country in a given year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concepts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) is the source of the definition of intentional homicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intentional homicide (ICCS 0101): Unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent to cause death or serious injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statistical definition contains three elements that characterize the killing of a person as &amp;#x201C;intentional homicide&amp;#x201D;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The killing of a person by another person (objective element);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The intent of the perpetrator to kill or seriously injure the victim (subjective element);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The unlawfulness of the killing, which means that the law considers the perpetrator liable for the unlawful death (legal element).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This definition states that, for statistical purposes, all killings corresponding to the three criteria above should be considered as intentional homicides, irrespective of definitions provided by national legislations or practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), deaths coded with ICD-10 codes X85-Y09 (injuries inflicted by another person with intent to injure or kill) and ICD-10 code Y87.1 (sequelae of assault), or ICD-11 codes PD50-PF2Z and PJ20-PJ2Z, generally correspond to the definition of intentional homicide discussed above.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
