	<data>&lt;p&gt;Two separate sources exist at country level: a) criminal justice system; b) civil registration/vital statistics. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) collects and publishes data from criminal justice systems through its annual data collection mandated by the UN General Assembly (UN Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems, UN-CTS); the World Health Organization (WHO) collects and publishes death certificate data (civil registration/vital statistics). The data collection through the UN-CTS is facilitated by a network of over 140 national Focal Points appointed by responsible authorities.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
