{"status":"success","message":"The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 16-1-1, translated into en","data":"<p>The ICCS provides important clarifications on the definition of intentional homicide. In particular, it states that the following killings are included in the count of homicide:</p>\n<p>- Murder</p>\n<p>- Honour killing</p>\n<p>- Serious assault leading to death</p>\n<p>- Death as a result of terrorist activities</p>\n<p>- Dowry-related killings</p>\n<p>- Femicide</p>\n<p>- Infanticide</p>\n<p>- Voluntary manslaughter</p>\n<p>- Extrajudicial killings</p>\n<p>- Killings caused by excessive force by law enforcement/state officials</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the ICCS provides indications on how to distinguish between intentional homicides, killings directly related to war/conflict and other killings that amount to war crimes.</p>\n<p>The fact that homicide data are typically produced by two separate and independent sources at national level (criminal justice and public health) represents a specific asset of this indicator, as the comparison of the two sources is a tool to assess accuracy of national data. Usually, for countries where data from both sources exist, a good level of matching between the sources is recorded (see UNODC Global Study on Homicide, 2013).</p>\n<p>Data on homicides produced by public health authorities are guided by the International classification of diseases (ICD-10), which provides a definition of &#x2018;Death by assault&#x2019; that is very close to the definition of intentional homicide of the ICCS.</p>"}
