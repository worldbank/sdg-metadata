	<data>&lt;p&gt;The ICCS provides important clarifications on the definition of intentional homicide. In particular, it states that the following killings are included in the count of homicide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Murder&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Honour killing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Serious assault leading to death&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Death as a result of terrorist activities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Dowry-related killings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Femicide&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Infanticide&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Voluntary manslaughter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Extrajudicial killings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Killings caused by excessive force by law enforcement/state officials&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the ICCS provides indications on how to distinguish between intentional homicides, killings directly related to war/conflict and other killings that amount to war crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that homicide data are typically produced by two separate and independent sources at national level (criminal justice and public health) represents a specific asset of this indicator, as the comparison of the two sources is a tool to assess accuracy of national data. Usually, for countries where data from both sources exist, a good level of matching between the sources is recorded (see UNODC Global Study on Homicide, 2013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on homicides produced by public health authorities are guided by the International classification of diseases (ICD-10), which provides a definition of &amp;#x2018;Death by assault&amp;#x2019; that is very close to the definition of intentional homicide of the ICCS.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
