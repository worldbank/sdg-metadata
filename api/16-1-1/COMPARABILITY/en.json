The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) makes special efforts to count all killings falling under the ICCS definition of intentional homicide, while national data may still be compiled according to national legal systems rather than the statistical classification. The gradual implementation of ICCS by countries should improve quality and consistency of national and international data.</p>\n<p>Intentional homicide rates may also differ due to the use of different population figures.</p>"}
