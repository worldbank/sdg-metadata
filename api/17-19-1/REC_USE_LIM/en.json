The financial figures presented in the PRESS therefore need to be interpreted with these challenges in mind. For instance, PRESS numbers rely on the Creditor Reporting System (CRS) for ODA commitments supplemented by voluntary reporting from additional donors. Yet, full coverage of all programs cannot be guaranteed. Furthermore, the reported commitments can be seen as an upper bound to the actual support to statistics for mainly three reasons. First, double counting of projects may occur when the donor and project implementer report on the same project or when all project co-financers report project totals. Second, the reported numbers may be inflated by working with project totals for multi-sector projects, which comprise only a small statistics component. Finally, the PRESS reports on donor-side commitments which do not always translate to actual disbursements to the recipient countries.</p>\n<p>The indicator only captures international support to statistics and does not account for domestic resources.</p>"}
