	<message>The SOURCE_TYPE field for indicator 17-19-1, translated into en</message>
	<data>&lt;p&gt;To provide a full picture of international support to statistics, the indicator draws on three distinct data sources. The first source of data is the OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS), which records data from OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) members and some non-DAC donors, and provides a comprehensive accounting of ODA. Donors report specific codes for the sector targeted by their aid activity. Statistical capacity building (SCB) is designated by code 16062. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, when SCB is a component of a larger project, it is not identified by this code, causing the CRS figures to underestimate actual levels of support for international aid. PARIS21 seeks to reduce this downward bias by searching project descriptions in the CRS for terms indicating a component of SCB. The methodology is presented at http://www.paris21.org/PRESS2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, and finally, the PARIS21 Secretariat supplements this data with an online questionnaire completed by a global network of reporters. The questionnaire covers a subset of the variables collected in the CRS and some additional variables specific to statistical capacity building. Reporting to the questionnaire is voluntary, offering an opportunity for actors to share information on their statistical activities. Reporters to this questionnaire are countries that do not report to the CRS, as well as multilateral institutions with large portfolios of statistical projects that have requested to report to the PARIS21 Secretariat directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
